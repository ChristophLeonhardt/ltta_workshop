1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:04,100
If you’re in Zimbabwe
and need cash,

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:06,520
Vincent’s your guy.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,500
Two years ago,

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,580
he graduated with a
degree in accounting.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,170
But he didn’t land a job.

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,840
So he’s on the street,
exchanging U.S. dollars

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,140
and South African rand

8
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,170
for Zimbabwe’s failing currency.

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,630
The country’s so short on cash,

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,060
people line up at
A.T.M.s for hours

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,935
just to get 20 bucks.

12
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,330
There are virtually no jobs.

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,870
So Vincent's generation,
college-educated and ambitious,

14
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,920
is stuck, hawking shoes,
phone chargers, bras.

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,430
Many give up and leave.

16
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,760
Right now any money he makes

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,860
goes to a broker, who has
promised to get him

18
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,819
work papers in South Africa.

19
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,400
Vincent’s trying to get out, too.

20
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,020
We came to Zimbabwe to
witness its first elections

21
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,320
since Robert Mugabe 
was forced out.

22
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,340
For almost 40 years,

23
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,880
Mugabe’s oppressive rule
isolated the country

24
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,060
and crippled its economy.

25
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,530
The military-backed
government that overthrew him

26
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,188
promised change.

27
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,060
They even called an election,

28
00:01:37,255 --> 00:01:38,945
and let in journalists.

29
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,890
We saw genuine 
excitement on the street.

30
00:01:50,965 --> 00:01:52,585
Followed by violence.

31
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,270
Six people were killed,
and the same ruling party

32
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:59,010
was declared the winner.

33
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,410
So is this true change?

34
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,430
Sure, Mugabe is gone.

35
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,560
But everywhere we look,

36
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,180
corruption, violence 
and fear still run deep.

37
00:02:09,324 --> 00:02:10,324
Like here.

38
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:15,120
In 2005, the ruling party
forced nearly 700,000 people

39
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,070
into squatter camps.

40
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,820
The goal: To create a voting
bloc dependent on the state

41
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,610
and break up
opposition strongholds.

42
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,810
The result:
a broken community.

43
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,370
We meet Collen.

44
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,670
He was brought here after the
government burned his home.

45
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,600
He’s lived here for 15 years

46
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,640
and the place still lacks
basic infrastructure.

47
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,720
But his vocal
criticism has made him

48
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,910
a target for intimidation.

49
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,280
So he’s moved his
family into hiding.

50
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,845
Desperate, many women here
turn to prostitution.

51
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,630
Because of the 
cash shortage,

52
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,470
Tracey’s clients send 
payments to her phone —

53
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,020
if they pay at all.

54
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,100
Outside of the capital,

55
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,060
we see the roots of despair
in these neglected fields.

56
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,790
Agriculture is critical
to Zimbabwe’s economy.

57
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,160
This is Steve Krynauw.

58
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,620
Eighteen years ago,
he lived here.

59
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,550
In 2000, Steve
and three friends

60
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,550
were kidnapped, beaten
and left for dead.

61
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,000
One friend was killed.

62
00:04:15,534 --> 00:04:17,724
It was part of
Robert Mugabe’s plan

63
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,920
to right the wrongs
of colonialism

64
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,170
by seizing land owned
by white farmers

65
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,480
and giving it to
black Zimbabweans —

66
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,880
by force if necessary.

67
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,140
Steve was driven off his farm
and never compensated.

68
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:36,100
But the property didn’t
go to local black farmers.

69
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,250
It went to a military family
loyal to the party.

70
00:04:42,575 --> 00:04:44,175
With no farming experience,

71
00:04:44,175 --> 00:04:46,550
the land went to waste 
and the house burned

72
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,190
in a brush fire.

73
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,960
It was a common story.

74
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,820
Seizing the land
and handing it out

75
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,720
to a ruling elite that led
the country to total ruin.

76
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,050
And the same elite
still governs.

77
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,600
But then, there’s
Richard Muvungha.

78
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,900
He’s a veteran.

79
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,450
Fifteen years ago, he 
was granted this land

80
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,090
formerly owned by a 
white cattle rancher.

81
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,700
He learned how to farm and
transformed the property.

82
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,860
But his investment
isn’t guaranteed.

83
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,370
The state owns all of
the redistributed lands.

84
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,550
Richard can’t use his property
as collateral for loans.

85
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,460
It’s hard to acquire
new plots for expansion.

86
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,040
And the risk remains that
the government could seize it

87
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,660
from him at any time.

88
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,860
The night the election 
results are announced,

89
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,380
the city is on lockdown.

90
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,650
We see only riot police
and soldiers.

91
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,900
The opposition
challenges the results.

92
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,390
“Persecution. Intimidation.”

93
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,200
Journalists are corralled
by police.

94
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,870
Reports emerge of 
beatings and arrests.

95
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,750
It’s a far cry from the
peace and prosperity

96
00:06:20,750 --> 00:00:00,000
that were promised.
