shit yeah alright so lately have been on
the warpath on securing America's
elections I come to find out you
actually proposed legislation on that
that's right that's right I like what
you're thinking ahead so we had a
situation in Kansas where there was a
big computer glitch and Kobach was down
13 points before the glitch she comes
out after the glitch is winning that
Johnson County Kansas put that aside
it's just what we went we had a reporter
going ass okay
how can we verify the vote and the
answer was you can't that's deeply
frustrating and weird in a democracy so
for example what is your legislation do
that could help fix it it's not only
frustrating and weird it is at the heart
of what is positive boaters to lose
trust in our election system
this is the threat to our democracy that
very few leaders in our country are
talking about he actually offering real
solutions
that we're sitting in primary elections
in different
to go but but still hasn't been address
and that's what my bill that is scaring
America's Elections Act is intentionally
narrowly focused
to solve this very problem
for the 2018 elections
to say you should use about if you're
not going to balance an electronic
system there has to be stuff
paper backup of the boat that has cast
we saw through the the DEF CON the
hacking convection that just happened
you
is our hacking into election system buzz
within minutes no to be ferried to take
up ten minutes so they can always strive
for more yeah you know I got Tiger Balm
at home and she's over the house for
ready no but seriously
you know there's a lot of people in
Democratic Party who say they care about
voter integrity a word about Russian
interference etc to be fair the
Republican in the Senate in the house
also say they care about the Russian
interference I'm worried about any
interference and and if we can't verify
the boat are we really sure that even if
they have a good intention that a local
county official in Kansas or anywhere
else can outwit a hacker whether it's in
Russia India or just simply at home
right
others interfering in our collections
what interference could cover everything
from
a foreign country putting up Facebook
ads
as
countries
and by the way as we do and have done
for a lot
trees so setting that aside we have the
very real
where our citizens who are casting those
votes can be
lack of the paper factor in our
elections systems and in our bill
required emergency funding to help the
states and counties do
the state of Virginia when they had
their elections in 2017 they saw this
threat and as well
their elections and very quickly within
weeks
and I talked with there
elections they didn't have a single call
complaining about the integrity so I
think if you're sitting at home you
gotta be wondering why isn't this
unanimous like the Republicans say
they're always worried about voter fraud
I mean this would prevent a much more
realistic opportunity to do voter fraud
like one dude walking in who is an
undocumented immigrant or voting twice
is a billion times less of a problem
than a hacker changing all the votes
which you know as piranha bite can be
done in ten minutes by by teenagers so
what is the opposition say why isn't it
passive to point out this is a
nonpartisan concern I think all
Americans regards here your political
ideologies are concerned about making
sure that our votes are counted in
Congress unfortunately we have both
it's who many of them are making a lot
of noise
influence and interference and voter
fraud and all of these things but not
actually doing anything about it my bill
is very simple it was crafted in a very
narrow way for the intent of it passing
quickly and easily
put it into place so for everybody who's
watching at home you know I encourage
you to call your member of Congress and
ask them why if they have and if they
haven't why not
why haven't they signed up to the
security of Americans Elections Act but
your which your you know
walk behind the top can actually take
action to get something done because all
it takes is one right yeah
look we're s is it an incredible
movement to get Democrats to support
Medicare for all
I would are you led by those Democrats
and and it worked it pressured 78
congressmen to support Medicare overall
in the house so we can do it potentially
on this issue as well and it's not just
Democrats or Republicans do you see care
about voter fraud I mean this is voter
fraud extraordinary at least a potential
Court and this is timely for all the
reason attention project this isn't
something that we can afford to sit
around and hash out on discussed for
years and years and years we know these
vulnerabilities
we have the solution all right so let's
talk about your critics so they came
after you in in your last election which
you barely survived what did you win
back now I am so grateful to the people
a boy to have placed 84% votes in
confidence
really taking a stand for peace taking a
stand in support of the work that we're
trying to do and advocating for an end
to there's a change towards okay so it
was a squeaker well you've only got 84%
of what I got so one of the questions
that people bring up often is for policy
and specifically
you went to go see Bashar al-assad so
obviously he did that for a reason right
so what was it what was the reason we
are serious about
we have to be willing to have those
conversations we have to be willing to
sit down at the top of people whether
they need friends or they be adversaries
in order to pursue that path of peace
and I'm glad you brought that up because
one of my points
we just finished she received she
claimed to be more progressive than I
and she earned the University of the
National Education Association as well
as our local the leadership of that
organization in the leadership of our
local chapter purely because they
disagreed with
interventionist position and my
opposition to regime change Wars and
therefore place their support behind her
and this is a unfortunate recurrent
problem that we're seeing with people
who are so-called progressives who are
okay on a number of issues but when it
comes to the
he's far too often they are so quick to
jump to beating those war drums and to
say let's go drop bombs in other
countries the guy
so that only they can feel
they've done something about it
I don't mind I just want to read a quick
quote right now because this is
important to understand the content
that my opponent put out during the
election the answer to the question
under what circumstances should America
go to war can be very important question
and she said as a superpower of our
country is responsible for combating
genocide anywhere in the world and that
a big citizens in action should not be
an option for the United States as
it is my opinion that without heating
this warm charge we are doomed to repeat
mistakes
Hitler Stalin and Papa when faced with
dictators such as Assad Modi and LCC so
as you look at that statement that
statement
just one example of the kinds of
attitudes that we see and the intentions
that we see for many so-called
progressives who feel strongly that it
is our role to use the United States
military
and to go it overthrow dictators in
countries
it's dangerous so that brings up a lot
of questions but it didn't tackle one by
one count so first of all I didn't know
that she was in favor of invading India
that's a it's a twist I did not expect I
got my issues with Modi I got a issues
with every person that she this is
significant significant issues but what
what are we gonna do about India well
that's what I was gonna get to so what's
your proposal what can we do about a
situation whether it's North Korea or
let's take the ring of Muslims and their
great displacement and the massacres
that happen it is heartbreaking it is
it's something we as Leeson people want
to do something about but is there
anything we can do and if you don't want
to use a military solution which is
incredibly understandable is from a
point of view be over progressive what
can we do
for years previous administration
administration now I have been
advocating strongly for direct talks
between the United States
to build that path towards peace which
is completely impossible unless you're
willing to have the conversation each
each of these situations are different
and they have to be approached and
understood
but again if we're serious about
pursuing that path of keys we have to be
willing to go in and have the
conversation figure out okay how can we
work this out so I know that depending
on where they are in the political
spectrum people have been generally
wildly hypocritical about this when
Obama talks to Iran the Conservatives
say how dare you when Trump talks to
North Korea they say what a genius when
you talk to Assad everybody says don't
do that right and so how about the Iran
deal did you have reservations there or
or be the Bhama was right to talk to
Iran in that case and it was the deal a
good one or not
the rod as a second would during that
campaign
a vastly criticized or his opposition
for doing that I had a lot of concerns
in the build-up towards that final Iran
deal
there are still a number of weaknesses
these other issues that were there but
ultimately I voted for
very clearly that we had two options in
that situation and there was no real
gray area between those
a vote for the Iran
lengthen the amount of time maybe
lengthen the amount of time that Iran
would have to be able to create
or vote against the deal and leave us
with the only option which would need to
take military action against Iran
from acquiring
so that's why I voted for it that's why
I have continued to be critical of this
administration's tearing apart and
trying to break down that you
because it takes us farther and farther
away from our goal and objective which
is peace and
you see intent on peace which I think
the mainstream media is annoyed by but I
think a lot of progress is probably
appreciate you know you know as a
veteran I've deployed twice in the
Middle East and I've seen firsthand the
cost of war
as well as
speak of the trillions of dollars that
we have spent
since 9/11 alone on these
interventionist regime-change wars which
should
investing
and in every time Republicans go on
cable news they're never asked hey
weren't those Wars impractical
you know whenever it's a progressive
policy position immediately everybody
asks hey Medicare for all isn't that
impractical higher wages for Americans
is not impractical how did that work the
interest of the American
we're talking about a rock
each of these examples when asked that
question has been counterproductive to
the interests of the American people
counterproductive to our security
has certainly made
so one more thing outside so you went to
spoke to did you get anything out of it
like meaning like did he say anything to
you that you found to be interesting
struck though that that was helpful in
any way
the invitation was
because of that
if our goal is to end this war
so much of what I heard from the city
was
affirming a lot of what i already
there
all these other countries Saudi Arabia
Qatar of France and these other kind
- just get out of there
the leaders of the initial
continue to be the opposition against
