00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:14,099
we've just been to the site where the
mudslide happened on Monday and we're

2
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,359
recovery operations are now going on
trying to find bodies out of the rubble

3
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,550
and it is a very intense pain peak in
operation there are people walking

4
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:30,800
around everywhere wearing the white able
face mark there's a lot of the clay and

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,750
the clay them grease in that site and
increasingly they're not hopeful that

6
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,350
they will find anymore whole body
because it's raining the weather is lack

7
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:52,140
of visibility closed portal it really is
an intense time for the country and

8
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,539
people are just mostly standing around
in this era of shell shock they caused

9
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,730
quite get over that this is happening
again in a country that has suffered so

10
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:08,670
much tragedy in such a short time with
the war with Ebola and now this they're

11
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:16,170
really just asking why Syria wider
knowledge so everywhere you go there are

12
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:23,840
tales of obsessed and devastation and
hardly anyone in this country will have

13
00:01:23,840 --> 00:00:00,000
will not be affected by this very very
tragic event
