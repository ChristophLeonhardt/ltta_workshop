1
00:00:09,748 --> 00:00:10,449
HEATHER: WELCOME BACK, NEW

2
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:13,519
PROPOSAL TO FIGHT THE NEW OPIOID

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,187
CRISIS, 15 STATES YO SUE SEE

4
00:00:15,187 --> 00:00:16,889
THEM THERE, UNVEILING PLANS TO

5
00:00:16,889 --> 00:00:18,791
TAX DRUG MAKERS FOR PRESCRIPTION

6
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,860
PAIN KILLERS, SO IS THIS THE

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,696
RIGHT MOVE CRACK DOWN ON THE

8
00:00:23,696 --> 00:00:25,598
RAMPING USE OF OPIOIDS IN OUR

9
00:00:25,598 --> 00:00:25,931
COUNTRY?

10
00:00:25,931 --> 00:00:29,735
HERE THE WEIGH IN RADIOLOGIST

11
00:00:29,735 --> 00:00:34,173
DR. NICOLE SAPHIER.

12
00:00:34,173 --> 00:00:35,374
DESCRIBE OVERALL WHAT IS THE

13
00:00:35,374 --> 00:00:36,308
PLAN BEHIND THIS?

14
00:00:36,308 --> 00:00:37,509
THIS IS THE PLAN TO HAVE THE

15
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:39,511
DRUG MAKERS PAY FOR THE DRUGS

16
00:00:39,511 --> 00:00:41,080
BASICALLY, A LITTLE MORE?

17
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,381
>> THE OPIOID CRISIS HAS COST

18
00:00:42,381 --> 00:00:43,749
THE UNITED STATES OVER A

19
00:00:43,749 --> 00:00:45,718
TRILLION DOLLARS IN THE LAST TWO

20
00:00:45,718 --> 00:00:46,685
DECADES, THAT'S ASTRONOMICAL

21
00:00:46,685 --> 00:00:48,220
AMOUNT OF MONEY.

22
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,222
HOWEVER, FAR MAJORITY OF THE

23
00:00:50,222 --> 00:00:52,925
MONEY LOST IS DUE TO LOST JOBS

24
00:00:52,925 --> 00:00:54,793
FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN

25
00:00:54,793 --> 00:00:56,929
ADDICTED OR OVERDOSED ON ILLEGAL

26
00:00:56,929 --> 00:00:57,363
OPIOIDS.

27
00:00:57,363 --> 00:00:59,198
MY CONCERN IS LEVYING TAX FROM

28
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:00,900
THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IS

29
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,868
NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING BUT

30
00:01:02,868 --> 00:01:03,969
EXCEPT RAISE PRICES FOR THOSE

31
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:06,305
WHO ARE LEGITIMATE TAKING

32
00:01:06,305 --> 00:01:06,705
MEDICATION.

33
00:01:06,705 --> 00:01:08,207
I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT, WE DO

34
00:01:08,207 --> 00:01:09,642
NEED TO BRING REVENUE TO HELP

35
00:01:09,642 --> 00:01:12,478
WITH THIS BUT IN THE SAME STAND

36
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:13,913
SHOULD WE SAY WE SHOULD BE

37
00:01:13,913 --> 00:01:15,848
SIGNING OR TAXING ANY LEGISLATOR

38
00:01:15,848 --> 00:01:17,082
THAT'S OBSTRUCTION TO BORDER

39
00:01:17,082 --> 00:01:18,317
SECURITY BECAUSE THAT IS EXACTLY

40
00:01:18,317 --> 00:01:21,086
WHERE ALL THE ILLEGAL OPIOIDS

41
00:01:21,086 --> 00:01:23,689
ARE COMING FROM, YES, TAXES

42
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:24,890
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY MAY

43
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,892
BRING IN REVENUE BUT THAT'S NOT

44
00:01:26,892 --> 00:01:30,195
GOING TO MAKE A DENT IN THE

45
00:01:30,195 --> 00:01:30,829
OPIOID CRISIS.

46
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:32,398
HEATHER: IN PENNSYLVANIA, ONE OF

47
00:01:32,398 --> 00:01:34,667
THE PROPOSALS IT WOULD TAX 10%

48
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:37,303
OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE

49
00:01:37,303 --> 00:01:39,438
FIRST SALE OF A DRUG IN THE

50
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:42,875
STATE, SO WHAT EXACTLY WOULD

51
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:43,575
THAT MEAN?

52
00:01:43,575 --> 00:01:44,576
>> WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO IS

53
00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:47,546
WHEN THE MEDICATION IS BEING

54
00:01:47,546 --> 00:01:48,948
SOLD SRRY THE PHARMACEUTICAL

55
00:01:48,948 --> 00:01:50,449
COMPANY IS GOING TO BE TAXED ON

56
00:01:50,449 --> 00:01:53,385
THAT ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A NEW

57
00:01:53,385 --> 00:01:53,819
PRESCRIPTION.

58
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:54,753
WHAT IS THE PHARMACEUTICAL

59
00:01:54,753 --> 00:01:57,690
COMPANY GOING TO DO?

60
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,024
HEATHER: HOW HAY WILL MAKE UP

61
00:01:59,024 --> 00:02:01,560
THE COSTS?

62
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,729
>> INCREASE AND TAXPAYERS WILL

63
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:06,532
HAVE A TRICKLE-DOWN EFFECT.

64
00:02:06,532 --> 00:02:08,067
HEATHER: WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT

65
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:12,371
THE OVERALL LOBBYING EFFORT TO

66
00:02:12,371 --> 00:02:14,606
IMPOSE, $100 MILLION IN LOBBYING

67
00:02:14,606 --> 00:02:17,209
EFFORT BY DRUG MAKERS, BETWEEN

68
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:18,644
2006 TO 2015.

69
00:02:18,644 --> 00:02:19,812
>> THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY BY FAR

70
00:02:19,812 --> 00:02:21,981
HAS THE LARGEST LOBBYING EFFORTS

71
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:23,482
AND, YES, THEY'VE ALREADY

72
00:02:23,482 --> 00:02:25,751
RELEASED THEIR LOBBYISTS TO TRY

73
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:28,053
AND TACKLE THIS AND I DO THINK A

74
00:02:28,053 --> 00:02:31,090
LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY IS WASTED

75
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,624
ON LOBBYING ESPECIALLY FOR

76
00:02:32,624 --> 00:02:33,392
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, I DO

77
00:02:33,392 --> 00:02:36,095
THINK THEY ACTUALLY MAY HAVE

78
00:02:36,095 --> 00:02:39,098
SOME POINT BEHIND LOBBYING

79
00:02:39,098 --> 00:02:39,732
EFFORTS.

80
00:02:39,732 --> 00:02:41,367
HEATHER: WHAT OTHER OPTIONS

81
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:44,103
WOULD IT BE OTHER THAN PASSING

82
00:02:44,103 --> 00:02:46,805
PRICE TO CONSUMERS?

83
00:02:46,805 --> 00:02:48,107
>> PHYSICIANS REALLY NEED TO BE

84
00:02:48,107 --> 00:02:48,474
EDUCATED.

85
00:02:48,474 --> 00:02:49,775
YOU HAVE A LARGE AMOUNT OF

86
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:51,176
PHYSICIAN WHO IS ARE PRESCRIBING

87
00:02:51,176 --> 00:02:52,411
OPIOIDS THAT DON'T NECESSARILY

88
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:53,946
KNOW WHAT CAUSES PEOPLE TO

89
00:02:53,946 --> 00:02:55,748
BECOME ADDICTED AND WHAT DON'T

90
00:02:55,748 --> 00:02:57,750
-- WHAT DOES NOT, ESSENTIALLY WE

91
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,652
NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE NOT

92
00:03:00,652 --> 00:03:02,321
OVERPRESCRIBING OPIOIDS FOR PAIN

93
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:09,194
THAT CAN BE MANAGED BY TYLENOL,

94
00:03:09,194 --> 00:03:10,996
IF THEY TAKE IT TOO LONG, THE

95
00:03:10,996 --> 00:03:13,432
LONGER THEY TAKE OUTSIDE THE

96
00:03:13,432 --> 00:03:14,867
INCREASE RISK TO BECOMING

97
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:15,467
ADDICTED.

98
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:16,835
PHYSICIANS NEED TO BE AWARE AND

99
00:03:16,835 --> 00:03:18,704
EDUCATING THE FACT THAT BY

100
00:03:18,704 --> 00:03:20,372
SHORTENING DURATION THEY ARE

101
00:03:20,372 --> 00:03:21,907
DECREEING RISK OF PEOPLE GETTING

102
00:03:21,907 --> 00:03:23,442
OPIOID ADDICTION.

103
00:03:23,442 --> 00:03:24,810
HEATHER: AND I KNOW THAT YOU AND

104
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,612
I DISCUSSED BEFORE ALTERNATIVE

105
00:03:26,612 --> 00:03:29,481
TO DRUGS THAT WOULD BE SO

106
00:03:29,481 --> 00:03:29,915
ADDICTIVE?

107
00:03:29,915 --> 00:03:31,016
>> IN INTERVENTION RADIOLOGY, WE

108
00:03:31,016 --> 00:03:32,317
HAVE AMAZING TECHNOLOGY RIGHT

109
00:03:32,317 --> 00:03:34,586
NOW THAT WE ARE USING WITH PAIN

110
00:03:34,586 --> 00:03:36,288
CONTROL, NERVE BLOCKS, INFUSIONS

111
00:03:36,288 --> 00:03:37,790
OF DIFFERENT MEDICATIONS AND BY

112
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:43,162
THE WAY, IVTYLENOL HAS SHOWN TO

113
00:03:43,162 --> 00:03:47,132
BE BETTER, THE PROBLEM IS

114
00:03:47,132 --> 00:03:48,634
EXPENSIVE.

115
00:03:48,634 --> 00:03:50,335
HEATHER: PERHAPS MAKE THE

116
00:03:50,335 --> 00:03:53,705
OPIOIDS MORE EXPENSE AIF

117
00:03:53,705 --> 00:03:56,275
ALTERNATIVES LESS EXPENSIVE SO

118
00:03:56,275 --> 00:03:59,311
PEOPLE CAN BE INCLINED TO USE

119
00:03:59,311 --> 00:03:59,678
MORE.

120
00:03:59,678 --> 00:04:00,546
>> WE NEED TO TALK TO INSURANCE

121
00:04:00,546 --> 00:00:00,000
COMPANIES BECAUSE THEY MANDATE
