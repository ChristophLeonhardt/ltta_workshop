working out it's been probably one of the most influential things on growing my business and it just feels good I used to read a lot of the Business Insider posts where you asked CEOs what's the first thing you do in the morning and all every CEO is going to say you know I wake up and I work out and I would skip that and I would go to the next section so I could read what cool productivity app do they use how stupid I was skipping the first thing that all of them had in common and going to look for some app I wasn't ready to understand why everybody talks about fitness and I would just say things like like I used to be really skinny like 50 pounds skinnier and I would just say I'm not a fitness guy I'm just a skinny Indian guy it became part of my identity and I think for a lot of us we will say things like I'm not a gym person but whether it's gym or going for a run or whatever there's a reason that almost every top performer talks about exercise and working out and it's something I wish I would have learned a little earlier
