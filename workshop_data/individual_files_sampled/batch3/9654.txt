OKAY, THE MISS AMERICA BEAUTY PAGEANT WILL NO LONGER BE A BEAUTY PAGEANT. IT WILL BE A COMPETITION. THE ORGANIZATION ANNOUNCED TODAY IN A STATEMENT, WE ARE NO LONGER A PAGEANT. MISS AMERICA WILL REPRESENT A NEW GENERATION OF FEMALE LEADERS FOCUSED ON SCHOLARSHIP, SOCIAL IMPACT, TALENT AND EMPOWERMENT. BUT THIS COMPETITION WILL NOT INCLUDE THE SWIMSUIT COMPETITION WITH THE ORGANIZATION STATING," WILL NO LONGER JUDGE OUR CANDIDATES ON THEIR OUTWARD PHYSICAL APPEARANCE. WELL, LET'S DEBATE THIS. MEDICINE, A FORMER MISS OHIO IN THE MISS USA PAGEANT. THIS IS WILD BECAUSE, IF, MADISON, OUTWARD APPEARANCE HAS NO RELEVANCE WHATSOEVER TO THIS WHOLE THING, THEN WHY DON'T YOU JUST DO IT LIKE, ON THE RADIO? I HOST A RADIO SHOW AND A COLOR MADE A COMMENT TODAY. I WAS SCREAMING LAUGHING. I WAS THINKING, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THE MAKEUP OR THE HAIR, YOU COULD JUST TALK. THEY ARE EXACTLY RIGHT, I'M NOT IMPRESSED WITH WHAT MISS AMERICA ORGANIZATION HAS DECIDED TO DO. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DEFINITION OF PAGEANT, IT IS A CONTEST. OF COURSE OUTER BEAUTY IS NOT THE SAME AS IN HER BEAUTY BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT OUTER BEAUTY SHOULD NOT EXIST. WOMEN SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES, HAVE A POSITIVE BODY IMAGE AND TO SHOW OFF THEIR PHYSICAL FITNESS. THERE IS LITERALLY NOTHING LEFT. EVENING GOWN CAN BE ANYTHING YOU WANT. IT CAN BE ANY OUTFIT. SO, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT WAS IN THE 90s THAT IT WAS WHEN THE BIKINI STARTED. SO IT WAS LIKE 97 I TNK THEY STARTED DOING THE PEKINGESE, WHICH YOU KNOW, BY MEN LIKE IT BUT IT IS A LITTLE MUCH ON THE BIKINI. BUT THE ONE PIECE, I THOUGHT THAT WAS PRETTY AND DIGNIFIED AND ALSO AND ATTRACTIVE. BUT, THIS, IS IT THE "ME TOO" THING, LIKE DON'T HATE US? I CAN'T EVEN KEEP UP WITH THE FEMINIST PART. THE FIRST THING EVERYTHING WAS WOMEN SHOULD BE EMPOWERED AND BE ABLE TO WEAR WHATEVER THEY WANT AND NOW THEY ARE SAYING WOMEN SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO WEAR WHATEVER THEY WANT. I CAN'T KEEP UP, IT'S RIDICULOUS AND TOTALLY OFF BASE. I DON'T THINK THEY ARE MAKING A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE "ME TOO" MOVEMENT. AND THEY ARE CASTING ASPERSIONS ON PEOPLE LIKE YOU. NOW YOU WERE MISS OHIO, AND YOU JUST TOOK THE BAR, PASS THE BAR, CONGRATULATIONS. SO MANY PEOPLE IN THESE PAGEANTS AND COMPETITIONS GO ON TO DO INCREDIBLE THINGS, MAYBE THEY ARE PROFESSIONAL MOMS OR DOCTORS, LAWYERS. BUT JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE ATTRACTIVE DOESN'T MEAN YOU ALSO DON'T HAVE ALL THESE OTHER THINGS YOU WANT TO DO IN LIFE. EXACTLY. IT SHOULD NEVER BE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND THAT'S I THINK WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT. IS THERE A REAL RIVALRY BETWEEN THEM MISS AMERICA PEOPLE AND THE USA PEOPLE? THE JOKE HAS ALWAYS BEEN COME MISS AMERICA IS THE GIRL NEXT DOOR MS USA AS THE GIRL YOU WISH
