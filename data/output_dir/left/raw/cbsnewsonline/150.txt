1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:01,568
WITH CUSTOMS OFFICIALS AND 

2
00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:03,503
PRAISING THEM FOR THEIR HARD 

3
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,704
WORK AND ALSO MEETING WITH SOME 

4
00:00:05,704 --> 00:00:09,309
OF THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE 

5
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:10,643
ALREADY OR AT LEAST FOLKS THAT 

6
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:15,482
HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THEIR 

7
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:18,384
FAMILIES THAT MAY POSSIBLILY BE 

8
00:00:18,384 --> 00:00:18,651
REUNITED. 

9
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:19,251
SO I DON'T KNOW CAN WE HEAR 

10
00:00:19,251 --> 00:00:19,652
WHAT'S HAPPENING? 

11
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:21,854
LET'S SEE IF THERE IS SOUND. 

12
00:00:21,854 --> 00:00:23,823
>> THE PRESIDENT HAD TALKED 

13
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:25,325
ABOUT THE FACT THAT HIS WIFE 

14
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:29,229
HAD SPOKEN TO HIM ABOUT THE 

15
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,396
SEPARATION OF FAMILIES, HIS 

16
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:32,631
DAUGHTER IVANKA HAD SPOKE TO 

17
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:35,535
HIM ABOUT THE SEPARATION OF 

18
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:39,072
FAMILIES AND EXPRESSED THEIR 

19
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:39,905
DISMAY, DISAPPOINTMENT AND 

20
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:40,539
FRUSTRATION SEEING THAT HAPPEN 

21
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:40,906
AT THE BORDER. 

22
00:00:40,906 --> 00:00:41,841
WHO KNOWS IF THAT HAD AN 

23
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:45,177
INFLUENCE OR LED HIM TO SIGN 

24
00:00:45,177 --> 00:00:46,379
THE EXECUTIVE ORDER BUT IT WAS 

25
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:46,812
THE FIRST LADY-- 

26
00:00:46,812 --> 00:00:48,481
>> THERE SHE IS. 

27
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:49,782
>> WE CAN SEE HER RIGHT NOW. 

28
00:00:49,782 --> 00:00:52,418
HE DID SAY WHEN HE WAS SIGNING 

29
00:00:52,418 --> 00:00:55,155
THE BILL THE FIRST LADY AS WELL 

30
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,890
AS HIS DAUGHTER IVANKA TRUMP 

31
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,356
DID NOT LIKE IT. 

32
00:00:57,356 --> 00:01:00,527
THE FIRST LADY SHOULD BE 

33
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:02,428
COMMENDED FOR VISITING AND 

34
00:01:02,428 --> 00:01:05,798
SEEING WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE 

35
00:01:05,798 --> 00:01:07,667
FAMILIES WITH HER OWN EYES. 

36
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:08,267
IVANKA TRUMP IS A DIFFERENT 

37
00:01:08,267 --> 00:01:08,501
STORY. 

38
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:09,101
SHE'S A SENIOR ADVISOR TO THE 

39
00:01:09,101 --> 00:01:10,770
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

40
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,940
AND SHE TWEETED IN SUPPORT OF 

41
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:14,774
HIS DECISION YESTERDAY TO SIGN 

42
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,876
THE EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT WOULD 

43
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:19,245
PREVENT FAMILIES FROM BEING 

44
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,414
SEPARATED BUT THE ANALYSIS WAS 

45
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,816
AS A SENIOR ADVISOR WHY DIDN'T 

46
00:01:23,816 --> 00:01:24,784
YOU ADVISE THE PRESIDENT TO 

47
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:27,454
PERHAPS NOT EVEN UNDER TAKE 

48
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:32,058
THIS POLICY THAT MANY ARE 

49
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:33,058
CALLING INHUMANE AND BARBARIC 

50
00:01:33,058 --> 00:01:34,727
INCLUDING RELIGIOUS LEADERS ON 

51
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:36,329
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. 

52
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,966
>> THIS IS INTERESTING 

53
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,568
ACCORDING TO SOME OF OUR 

54
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:42,302
REPORTING THIS TRIP WAS MELANIA 

55
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,937
TRUMP, THE FIRST LADY'S IDEA 

56
00:01:44,937 --> 00:01:46,673
AND SHE WANTED TO SEE 

57
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:47,506
EVERYTHING FOR HERSELF. 

58
00:01:47,506 --> 00:01:49,108
THE CHILDREN ARE AN IMPORTANT 

59
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:52,445
PART OF HER PLATFORM AND SHE 

60
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,045
SUPPORTS FAMILY REUNIFICATION 

61
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:55,048
AND SHE WANTED TO FIND OUT HOW 

62
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,382
SHE CAN HELP. 

63
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:59,452
SHE FEELS THE EXECUTIVE ORDER 

64
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,553
YESTERDAY PAVEED THE WAY 

65
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:01,187
FORWARD BUT THERE IS STILL MORE 

66
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:02,989
TO BE DONE AND SHE WANTS TO 

67
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:03,422
LEND HER SUPPORT. 

68
00:02:03,422 --> 00:02:06,358
IT ACTUALLY ECHOS A LOT OF WHAT 

69
00:02:06,358 --> 00:02:07,594
WE HEARD THE MAYOR SAY EARLIER 

70
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,062
TODAY WHEN WE HAD THE GROUP OF 

71
00:02:10,062 --> 00:02:11,464
MAYORS COMMENDING THE PRESIDENT 

72
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,031
FOR SIGNING THAT EXECUTIVE 

73
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:17,637
ORDER BUT SAYING THAT'S JUST 

74
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,004
THE BEGINNING. 

75
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:20,240
>> FOR SURE. 

76
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,773
AND LOOK, THE INTERESTING 

77
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:22,942
SITUATION HERE IS IT WILL BE 

78
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:25,311
GREAT FOR VIEWERS TO SEE THESE 

79
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:25,878
CHILDREN BECAUSE APPARENTLY 

80
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:26,679
SOME OF THE CHILDREN THAT ARE 

81
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:29,515
THERE ARE CHILDREN THAT HAVE 

82
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:30,450
BEEN SEPARATED FROM THEIR 

83
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:30,717
FAMILIES. 

84
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:34,020
THE QUESTION WILL BE WHY ISN'T 

85
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,589
THE PRESS ALLOWED INTO SOME OF 

86
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:37,323
THESE FACILITIES? 

87
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,858
WHY HAVEN'T WE BEEN GIVEN THE 

88
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:39,558
OPPORTUNITY TO SEE NOT FROM THE 

89
00:02:39,558 --> 00:02:43,463
GOVERNMENT AND WHAT THEY WANT 

90
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:46,165
US TO SEE BUT FROM THE PRESS' 

91
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:49,102
OWN EYES, THEIR OWN RECORDING 

92
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:52,772
TWICES WHETHER THEY BE CAMERAS 

93
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:55,441
OR RECORDING DEVICES OR VIDEO 

94
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:56,175
CAMERAS, THAT HASN'T HAPPENED 

95
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,109
YET SO SHE SHOULD BE COMMENDED 

96
00:02:57,109 --> 00:02:57,844
FOR GOING THERE AND SEEING WHAT 

97
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,746
IT IS LIKE BUT THERE ARE A LOT 

98
00:03:00,746 --> 00:03:02,382
OF QUESTIONS THAT STILL NEED TO 

99
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:03,115
BE ANSWERED. 

100
00:03:03,115 --> 00:03:05,118
>> THE FIRST LADY HERSELF AN 

101
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:11,190
IMMIGRANT AND THE PRESIDENT AND 

102
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,757
ADMINISTRATION NOT HAVING A 

103
00:03:11,757 --> 00:03:12,324
QUESTION ABOUT HOW SHE GOT 

104
00:03:12,324 --> 00:03:12,992
HERE, WHAT VISAS AND WHETHER OR 

105
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:13,626
NOT SHE--PARTICULARLY REMEMBER 

106
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:17,229
WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS 

107
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:17,863
CAMPAIGNING THERE WERE A LOT OF 

108
00:03:17,863 --> 00:03:18,463
QUESTIONS ABOUT NOT ONLY HOW 

109
00:03:18,463 --> 00:03:20,867
SHE GOT HERE BUT HOW HER 

110
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:21,934
PARENTS GOT HERE. 

111
00:03:21,934 --> 00:03:22,167
RIGHT? 

112
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:24,236
WAS IT THROUGH THAT FAMILIAL OR 

113
00:03:24,236 --> 00:03:27,040
THE REPUBLICANS CALL IT CHAIN 

114
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,340
MIGRATION? 

115
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:27,607
>> YEAH. 

116
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,676
>> LOOKS LIKE MAYBE WE CAN 

117
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:37,250
LISTEN IN NOW BECAUSE SHE SEEMS 

118
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,586
TO BE SORT OF GREETING PEOPLE. 

119
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:41,420
>> GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY. 

120
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,555

00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,481
OF OUR MISSION AND SIMILAR TO 

133
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,216
SOME OF THE CHILDREN THAT WE 

134

CHILDREN ALSO COME FROM A VERY 

139
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:19,791
DIFFICULT JOURNEY. 

140
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:23,863

ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL. 

147
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,975
ONE OF THE WHAT WE'VE 

148
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:38,077
EXPERIENCED, MRS. TRUMP, IS 

149
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:40,245
THAT THE EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATES 

150
00:04:40,245 --> 00:04:42,548
THAT FOR ANY CHILD TO BE 

151
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:43,449

00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,747
INDEED THEIR FAMILY AND THAT 

317
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:19,352
COULD LEAD TO VERIFICATION OF 

318
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:19,885
BIRTH CERTIFICATES, PHOTO 

319
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,120

321
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:21,887

332
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,680
THEY ARE DISTRAUGHT AND DON'T 

333
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,714
KNOW WHERE THEY ARE AT. 

334
00:10:49,714 --> 00:10:51,283
THEY ARE THINKING THEY ARE 

335
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,451
GOING TO CONTINUE IN THE 

336
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:53,519
PROCESS OF PROCESSING THEM AND 

337
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,321
WHEN THEY SEE THE ENVIRONMENT 

338
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,555
AND THEY SEE THE OTHER KIDS AND 

339
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,924
THEY SEE THE YARD THEY START 

340
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,926
RELAXING SO THE FIRST 24 HOURS 

341
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:02,695
ARE CRUCIAL FOR US MAKING SURE 

342
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:05,297

343
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,566
NEEDS, SHOWERS, CLOTHING, FOOD 

344
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:11,470
AND BEFORE WE EVEN START DSS. 

345
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,671

WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THEM THAT 

349
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,011
WAY WE CAN ADDRESS IT 

350
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,746
IMMEDIATELY AND THAT EVENTUALLY 

351
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:21,513
EVERY DEPARTMENT TAKES A TURN 

352
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:25,751
TO BE ABLE TO FURTHER ASSESS 

353
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:29,822

354
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:30,589

WHEN THE CHILDREN FIRST GET 

362
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,467
HERE, IT IS A PROCESS. 

363
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:45,037
THEY GO THROUGH AN ORIENTATION, 

364
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,105
THEY GO THROUGH A 24 HOUR 

365
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,339
INITIAL ORIENTATION WHERE WE 

366
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,808
GET AS MUCH INFORMATION AS WE 

367
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:53,579
POSSIBLY CAN FROM THE CHILDREN 

368
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:54,179
AGAIN TO ASSESS AND MAKE SURE 

369
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:56,348
THAT WE ARE NOT MISSING 

370
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:56,615
ANYTHING. 

371
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,552
IF THERE'S AN IMMEDIATE MEDICAL 

372
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,655
NEED THAT IS IMMEDIATELY 

373
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:02,955
ADDRESSED. 

374
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:05,491
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES OR ANY 

375
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,193
SEVERE WE BRING IN OUR 

376
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:10,162
PHYSICIANS AND AFTER THEY DO AN 

377
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,331
ORIENTATION THEY GO THROUGH 

378
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:13,065
SEVERAL ORIENTATIONS. 

379
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,266
THEY GO THROUGH THE SHELTER. 

380
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:16,001
THEY GO THROUGH CASE MANAGEMENT 

381
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:20,272
ORIENTATION AND ALSO GO THROUGH 

382
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:21,107
CLINICAL ORIENTATION. 

383
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,408
SO THEY WILL GET A 

384
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,743
UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR CURRENT 

385
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:27,546
PLACEMENT AND AGAIN THIS IS TO 

386
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:30,850
INFORM THEM AND KEEP THEM AS 

387
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,518
CALM AS POSSIBLE AND TO 

388
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:33,586
REASSURE THEM THAT THEY ARE 

389
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:33,853
INNOCENT. 

390
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:38,523
THEY WILL BE WELL TAKEN CARE OF 

391
00:12:38,523 --> 00:12:38,824
HERE. 

392
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,526
THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO 

393
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:40,859
WORRY ABOUT. 

394
00:12:40,859 --> 00:12:43,629
NOW THEY ARE IN A SAFE 

395
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:46,265
ENVIRONMENT, FREE FROM ABUSE. 

396
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,233
AND EVERY DAY YOU HAVE 

397
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,835
SOMETHING NEW WITH THE 

398
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:50,135
CHILDREN. 

399
00:12:50,135 --> 00:12:52,872
WE'VE PROVIDED A LOT OF 

400
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:55,074
STRUCTURE HERE. 

401
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:55,607
DURING THE MONDAY THROUGH 

402
00:12:55,607 --> 00:13:00,279
FRIDAY SCHEDULE, THEY DO ATTEND 

403
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:00,512
CLASS. 

404
00:13:00,512 --> 00:13:02,948
AND WE TRY TO EDUCATE THEM. 

405
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,283
WE TRY TO WHAT THE PUBLIC 

406
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,418
SCHOOL EDUCATION SYSTEM IS 

407
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:10,189
GOING TO BE LIKE. 

408
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,690
AND THEN WE ALSO INTEGRATE 

409
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,025
RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES, 

410
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:18,197
SPIRITUAL CARE FOR THE 

411
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,599
CHILDREN, DOWN TIME FOR THEM. 

412
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:20,999
IT'S JUST NORMAL. 

413
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:21,266
YOU KNOW? 

414
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:23,335
THEY REFER TO THESE AS SHELTERS 

415
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:27,740
BUT IT IS REALLY A HOME FOR THE 

416
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,307
CHILDREN. 

417
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,141
THIS IS THEIR HOUSE. 

418
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,911
SO THEIR BEDROOMS ARE THEIR 

419
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,412
BEDROOMS AND AS YOU WILL SEE 

420
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:39,318
THE CHILDREN AND SEE THE SMILES 

421
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,053
ON THEIR FACES AND YOU'LL HEAR 

422
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:42,554
THEM GIGGLE. 

423
00:13:42,554 --> 00:13:43,054
IT'S JUST FANTASTIC. 

424
00:13:43,054 --> 00:13:46,025
THE STAFF THAT WE HAVE HERE, WE 

425
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,260
JUST HAVE A TREMENDOUS PASSION 

426
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,596
FOR WORKING WITH THESE CHILDREN 

427
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:53,666
AND WE SEE THEM AS IF THEY WERE 

428
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,934
OUR OWN. 

429
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:55,935
AGAIN, WE DO MAINTAIN 

430
00:13:55,935 --> 00:14:00,606
BOUNDARIES AND WE DO HAVE THE 

431
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:01,340
POLICIES AND GUIDELINES. 

432
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,242
BUT AGAIN, JUST THE PASSION 

433
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,577
THAT IS THERE IN WORKING WITH 

434
00:14:05,577 --> 00:14:08,580
THESE CHILDREN ENSURING THAT 

435
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,216
THEY ARE SAFE AND ULTIMATELY 

436
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:14,820
REUNIFYING THEM WITH THEIR 

437
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,087
FAMILIES. 

438
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:15,687
>> HOW LONG IS THE TIME THAT-

439
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:16,455
-THE MAX TIME THAT SOMEBODY IS 

440
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:19,758
SENT HERE THAT THEY WOULD BE 

441
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:22,127
REUNITED WITH THEIR FAMILY? 

442
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:22,727
>> RIGHT NOW WE ARE AVERAGING 

443
00:14:22,727 --> 00:14:24,763
CURRENTLY 42 TO 45 DAYS. 

444
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:25,631
>> OH OKAY. 

445
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,699
>> SO IT'S NOT AN EXTENDED STAY 

446
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:31,470
AND WE ARE ALWAYS FOLLOWING THE 

447
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,605
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AS FAR 

448
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:34,506
AS REUNIFICATIONS ARE CONCERNED 

449
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:37,009
WITH THE CHILDREN. 

450
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,545
BUT THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY 

451
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:43,449
IS USUALLY 42 TO 45 DAYS. 

452
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,317
>> THAT'S GREAT. 

453
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:45,917
>> THERE IS SOME OCCASIONS 

454
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:48,787
WHERE SOME CHILDREN DO NOT HAVE 

455
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:49,721
ANYBODY TO GO BACK TO. 

456
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:52,424
AND THEN THOSE SITUATIONS, THEY 

457
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:56,462
ARE FURTHER ASSESSED BY THE 

458
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:57,763
LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDER THAT CAN 

459
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,064
HELP IDENTIFY IF THEY QUALIFY 

460
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:02,034
FOR SOME TYPE OF LEGAL RELIEF 

461
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,603
AND EVENTUALLY SOME CHILDREN 

462
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:08,507
WILL MOVE ONTO REFUGEE STATUS 

463
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:09,241
AND NOT UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN. 

464
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:09,808
AND AGAIN IT'S FEW AND FAR 

465
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,677
BETWEEN BUT WE DO HAVE THAT 

466
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:14,213
PROCESS WHERE SOME CHILDREN DO 

467
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:17,583
NOT HAVE ANYBODY TO GO TO WHOSE 

468
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,484
FAMILIES HAVE BEEN KILLED, 

469
00:15:19,484 --> 00:15:22,220
MURDERED AND JUST DIFFERENT 

470
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,789
VERY TRAGIC SITUATIONS AND 

471
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:25,423
HOPEFULLY WE GET TO SPEAK TO A 

472
00:15:25,423 --> 00:15:27,626
COUPLE OF CHILDREN TODAY AND 

473
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,494
YOU'LL SEE THAT. 

474
00:15:29,494 --> 00:15:30,329
THERE'S NOT HOPE FOR THEM TO GO 

475
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:34,133
BACK TO A COUNTRY THAT THEY'RE 

476
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:34,400
LEAVING. 

477
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,770
SO WE GET FROM WE HAVE KIDS 

478
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,407
THAT COME INTO CUSTODY AND ARE 

479
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,642
REUNIFIED RATHER QUICKLY IF 

480
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:44,376
EVERYTHING IS IN ORDER AND THEN 

481
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:45,411
WE HAVE SOME CHILDREN THAT WILL 

482
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,546
UNFORTUNATELY AND FORTUNATELY 

483
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,114
STAY WITHIN THE SYSTEM FOR A 

484
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,451
NUMBER OF YEARS UNTIL THEY CAN 

485
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,986
QUALIFY FOR REFUGEE STATUS AND 

486
00:15:53,986 --> 00:16:00,025
MOVE ON TO THE OTHER SISTER 

487
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,593
PROGRAM WHICH IS THE 

488
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:02,193
UNACCOMPANIED MINOR PROGRAM. 

489
00:16:02,193 --> 00:16:04,196
>> THESE CHILDREN COME ALONE 

490
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,129
WITHOUT PARENTS? 

491
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:07,232
>> THE MAJORITY OF OUR 

492
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:10,469
CHILDREN, YES, MA'AM, THEY ARE 

493
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,071
UNACCOMPANIED AND DETAINED BY 

494
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:13,672
DHS AND BORDER PATROL FOR THE 

495
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:14,306
MAJORITY AND THAT'S A BIG PART 

496
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,608
OF WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE WORK 

497
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:17,209
WITH, YES, MA'AM. 

498
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:20,312
>> BECAUSE THEY ARE BETWEEN 12 

499
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,414
AND 17 YEARS OLD, RIGHT? 

500
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:22,747
>> YES. 

501
00:16:22,747 --> 00:16:24,716
>> SO THEY KIND OF UNDERSTAND 

502
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:25,083
AND THEY KNOW. 

503
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:25,316
>> YES. 

504
00:16:25,316 --> 00:16:25,851
>> WHERE THEY ARE. 

505
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,752
>> YES, MA'AM. 

506
00:16:27,752 --> 00:16:29,621
>> SO THEY'RE NOT YOUNG, YOUNG 

507
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:29,888
CHILDREN. 

508
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:30,556
>> YES, MA'AM, THAT'S CORRECT. 

509
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:31,557
>> DO YOU HAVE THE CAPABILITY 

510
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:34,893
TO TAKE CARE OF YOUNGER 

511
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:35,927
CHILDREN HERE, YOUNGER THAN 12? 

512
00:16:35,927 --> 00:16:39,631
>> OUR STATE LICENSE DOES ALLOW 

513
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:44,670
US TO TAKE CHILDREN UP UNTIL AS 

514
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,740
YOUNG AS SIX BUT FOR THE 

515
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,340
CURRENT CENSUS RIGHT NOW, ORR 

516
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:53,045
HAS ASKED US TO STAY WITHIN THE 

517
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,447
12 TO 17 RANGE. 

518
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:56,515
>> AND MR. SECRETARY OFTEN 

519
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,048
TIMES WILL PLACE YOUNGER 

520
00:16:57,048 --> 00:16:58,450
CHILDREN IN OUR FOSTER. 

521
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,085
>> CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT PROCESS 

522
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:00,852
OF HOW YOU DO THAT? 

523
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:01,152
>> SURE. 

524
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:10,395
SO AT THE TIME OF DETENTION OR 

525
00:17:10,395 --> 00:17:10,928
APPREHENSION WE WORK VERY 

526
00:17:10,928 --> 00:17:11,561
CLOSELY WITH OUR PARTNERS OVER 

527
00:17:11,561 --> 00:17:12,163
AT HOMELAND SECURITY AND THEY 

528
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:12,797
IDENTIFY YOUNG CHILDREN FROM 

529
00:17:12,797 --> 00:17:15,467
ZERO TO 5 YEARS OLD AND WE HAVE 

530
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,502
A SERIES OF NETWORK OF FOSTER 

531
00:17:17,502 --> 00:17:18,170
HOMES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED 

532
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,438
STATES THAT ARE LICENSED IN 

533
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:22,307
THAT PARTICULAR STATE TO WORK 

534
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:25,743
WITH CHILDREN FROM ZERO TO 5 

535
00:17:25,743 --> 00:17:26,044
YEARS OLD. 

536
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:27,479
AND IT'S A FAMILY SETTING THAT 

537
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,981
THESE KIDS WORK IN AND AGAIN 

538
00:17:29,981 --> 00:17:34,853
THE SAME STANDARD APPLIES WHEN 

539
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:38,390
YOU ASSESS THEM FOR ANY MEDICAL 

540
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,191
NEED OR ANY SERIOUS 

541
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,493
COMPLICATION WHERE WE MAY HAVE 

542
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:46,732
TO USE DOCTORS, HOSPITALS IN 

543
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,366
THAT SITUATION BECAUSE WE GET 

544
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:50,769
EVERY TYPE OF CHILD IN OUR 

545
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:54,907
CUSTODY, SOMEBODY WHO IS NON 

546
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,575
MOBILE, NON-VERBAL TO SOMEBODY 

547
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,110
WHOSE MOM MAY HAVE PARISHED IN 

548
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,179
THE RIO GRANDE HERE IN SOUTH 

549
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:00,412
TEXAS. 

550
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,747
SO THOSE KIND OF KIDS ARE TAKEN 

551
00:18:02,747 --> 00:18:05,083
CARE OF VERY SPECIAL 

552
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,618
CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEY ARE 

553
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,053
THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES 

554
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:08,253
ALSO. 

555
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,589
>> AND WE AS UP BRING HAVE 

556
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,356

>> GREAT.

00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:20,432
THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

562
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,569
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO MEETING 

563
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,270
THE CHILDREN AND TOURING THE 

564
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,704
FACILITIES. 

565
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:29,641
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN FOR 

566
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,643
ALL OF WHAT YOU DO. 

567
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:31,944
THANK YOU. 

568
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:38,983
>> WHAT WE'LL DO NOW IS WE'LL 

569
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:46,424
WAIT HERE. 

570
00:18:46,424 --> 00:18:53,599
>>>  ALL RIGHT, SO YEAH, THE 

571
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:53,899
FIRST LADY. 

572
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:54,599
>> VISITING A--SORRY VLAD-

573
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:57,136
-VISITING A FACILITY IN WHERE 

574
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,405
THEY ARE HOUSING ABOUT 55 YOUNG 

575
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:01,807
PEOPLE BETWEEN THE AGES WE'VE 

576
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,674
LEARNED OF 12 AND 17. 

577
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,977
AND ACCORDING TO SOME OF OUR 

578
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,678
REPORTING THIS WAS THE FIRST 

579
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:07,011
LADY'S IDEA. 

580
00:19:07,011 --> 00:19:09,014
SHE WANTED TO SEE THESE 

581
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,182
FACILITIES AND SEE THE CHILDREN 

582
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:13,118
THAT WERE BEING HELD HERE. 

583
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,821
ACCORDING TO THE PEOPLE HERE 

584
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,421
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE 

585
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:17,089
CHILDREN CROSSED THE BORDER ON 

586
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,157
THEIR OWN SO THERE ARE NO 

587
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:20,225
FAMILIES FOR THEM TO GO BACK 

588
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:20,792
TO. 

589
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,462
>> IT'S INTERESTING THE FIRST 

590
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,330
LADY IS ABLE TO TOUR THE 

591
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,298
FACILITY WHERE JOURNALISTS ARE 

592
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:30,269
NOT BEING GIVEN THE SAME LEVEL 

593
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:30,903
OF ACCESS TO THESE FACILITIES 

594
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,571
NOT JUST THIS ONE BUT OTHERS WE 

595
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,406
ARE LEARNING EVEN HERE IN NEW 

596
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:35,339
YORK CITY HOUSING SOME OF THESE 

597
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:35,606
CHILDREN. 

598
00:19:35,606 --> 00:19:39,544
THESE ARE 12 YEARS OLD. 

599
00:19:39,544 --> 00:19:39,911
>> 12 TO 17. 

600
00:19:39,911 --> 00:19:40,445
>> IT'S A MUCH DIFFERENT 

601
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:43,714
SCENARIO FOR KIDS WHO ARE MUCH 

602
00:19:43,714 --> 00:19:45,817
YOUNGER, BABIES, TODDLERS, 

603
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:46,050
GIRLS. 

604
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,086
WE HAVEN'T SEEN IMAGES OF THAT. 

605
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,554
HERE'S THE THING, THIS IS--WHEN 

606
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:50,656
WE TALK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING 

607
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,157
TO THESE CHIRP, THIS IS THE 

608
00:19:53,157 --> 00:19:53,791
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND WE 

609
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,727
ARE NOT GOING TO PUT CHILDREN 

610
00:19:56,727 --> 00:19:57,261
IN TERRIBLE CONDITIONS. 

611
00:19:57,261 --> 00:19:58,597
THAT'S NOT THE POINT THAT 

612
00:19:58,597 --> 00:19:59,564
PEOPLE ARE MAKING. 

613
00:19:59,564 --> 00:20:01,332
THE POINT PEOPLE ARE MAKING IS 

614
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:03,535
THAT RIPPING A CHILD FROM THEIR 

615
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,305
PARENTS DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S 

616
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,140
A SUMMER CAMP THAT SOME HAVE 

617
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,107
CALLED IT OR ANYTHING ELSE, 

618
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:11,310
IT'S A TERRIBLE THING TO DO TO 

619
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,010
REMOVE A CHILD FROM THE ARMS OF 

620
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:13,344
ITS PARENTS. 

621
00:20:13,344 --> 00:20:16,881
>> BUT I THINK IT'S SORT OF 

622
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:17,949
SIGNIFICANT, VLAD, THAT--AND 

623
00:20:17,949 --> 00:20:19,918
IT'S GOOD THE FIRST LADY IS 

624
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:20,986
DOWN HERE BUT THEY MADE IT 

625
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,321
CLEAR THAT MOST OF THESE 

626
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,523
CHILDREN WERE NOT RIPPED FROM 

627
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:25,523
THE ARMS OF THEIR PARENTS. 

628
00:20:25,523 --> 00:20:27,326
SHE'S NOT IN ONE OF THOSE 

629
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:28,627
FACILITIES JUST LIKE YOU SAID 

630
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:31,463
SHE'S NOT IN A FACILITY WITH A 

631
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:32,597
TODDLER OR A BABY. 

632
00:20:32,597 --> 00:20:32,830
RIGHT? 

633
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,700
SO THIS IS SOMETHING VERY 

634
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,068
SPECIFIC BUT EVEN SAYING THAT, 

635
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,602
I MEAN, THE PEOPLE--ONE OF THE 

636
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:39,471
WOMEN THAT WAS THERE THE FIRST 

637
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:40,672
LADY ASKED ABOUT THE MENTAL 

638
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,007
STATE OF THESE CHILDREN AND ONE 

639
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:45,277
OF THE LADIES THERE SAID THEY 

640
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:46,178
OFTEN WHEN THEY COME HERE THINK 

641
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,180
THEY ARE JUST CONTINUING THE 

642
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:48,780
PATHWAY OF BEING PROCESSED. 

643
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,182
AND THEN ONCE THEY SEE THAT 

644
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,484
THERE ARE BEDS AND A YARD THEY 

645
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:53,352
REALIZE THAT NO, THIS IS GOING 

646
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:57,488
TO BE THEIR NEW HOME AT LEAST 

647
00:20:57,488 --> 00:20:58,055
FOR ACCORDING TO THE PEOPLE 

648
00:20:58,055 --> 00:20:58,756
HERE THE NEXT 45 DAYS OR SO. 

649
00:20:58,756 --> 00:21:01,125
>> RIGHT, THAT'S THE AVERAGE 

650
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,694
THEY HOLD THEM. 

651
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:03,895
SO LOOK, AS WE'VE BEEN SAYING 

652
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:06,498
IT'S A GOOD THING THE FIRST 

653
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:07,232
LADY IS THERE TO SEE EXACTLY 

654
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:10,035
WHAT IS HAPPENING AT LEAST IN 

655
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,603
THIS SPECIFIC AREA, THE 

656
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,405
SPECIFIC DETENTION CENTER AND 

657
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:14,306
CLEARLY SHOWS SOMETHING THE 

658
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:15,474
PRESIDENT HIMSELF SAID 

659
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,609
YESTERDAY THAT MELANIA THE 

660
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,910
FIRST LADY AS IVANKA TRUMP 

661
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,914
DIDN'T LIKE SEEING THE IMAGES 

662
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:25,317
THAT THE REST OF THE WORLD WAS 

663
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:26,718
 

664
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:27,251
SLEEPING ON THE FLOOR. 

665
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:28,286
AND SO SHE WANTS TO SEE FOR 

666
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:30,354
HERSELF AND SO IT'S SOMETHING 

667
00:21:30,354 --> 00:21:30,955
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE I THINK 

668
00:21:30,955 --> 00:21:32,858
ARE GOING TO BE COMMENDING HER 

669
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:33,058
FOR. 

670
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,160
WE'LL SEE WHAT SHE COMES BACK 

671
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,362
WITH WHAT SHE SAYS ABOUT HER 

672
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:37,795
EXPERIENCES THERE. 

673
00:21:37,795 --> 00:21:39,998
AND WHAT SHE LEARNED AND THE 

674
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:40,766
THINGS THAT SHE HOPES WILL 

675
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:41,600
HOPEFULLY CHANGE. 

676
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,338
>> AND YOU KNOW, SHE TWEETED 

677
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:46,938
OUT THAT SHE DID NOT LIKE TO 

678
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:47,572
SEE THE SEPARATION OF FAMILIES 

679
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:50,142
AND ALL OF THE OTHER LIVING 

680
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,009
FORMER FIRST LADIES EXPRESSED 

681
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:54,980
THEIR CONCERN ABOUT THIS POLICY 

682
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,881
INCLUDING BARBARA BUSH. 

683
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,382
SHE WROTE AN OP ED FOR THE 

684
00:21:57,382 --> 00:22:01,553
WASHINGTON POST AND IN IT SHE 

685
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:02,787
TALKED ABOUT HER MOTHER-IN-LAW 

686
00:22:02,787 --> 00:22:03,989
BARBARA BUSH WHEN BARBARA BUSH 

687
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:07,592
WENT TO GO SEE THE BABIES WHO 

688
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:08,660
WERE INFECTED WITH H.I.V. 

689
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,463
AND AIDS AND HOW THAT 

690
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:12,164
TRANSFORMED THE PUBLIC'S 

691
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:12,831
OPINION OF THOSE BABIES AND SHE 

692
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:13,932
DIDN'T NECESSARILY SUGGEST THAT 

693
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:16,768
THE FIRST LADY DO SOMETHING 

694
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:17,368
LIKE THAT BUT CERTAINLY BY 

695
00:22:17,368 --> 00:22:19,438
REMINDING US ALL OF THE IMPACT 

696
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:22,741
THAT A FIRST LADY CAN HAVE BY 

697
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:23,274
DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT 

698
00:22:23,274 --> 00:22:24,209
BECAUSE JUST TO PUT IT OUT 

699
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:26,077
THERE THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD 

700
00:22:26,077 --> 00:22:26,911
THING TO DO. 

701
00:22:26,911 --> 00:22:27,679
>> ABSOLUTELY AND WE'VE BEEN 

702
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,782
SAYING THAT THE IDEA THAT SHE 

703
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:31,916
WOULD SEE FOR HERSELF WHAT IS 

704
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:33,551
HAPPENING THERE AND CLEARLY HAS 

705
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:34,920
AN INTEREST IN THIS. 

706
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,889
SHE'S MADE IT PART OF HER 

707
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:39,423
PLATFORM, BULLYING, CHILDREN 

708
00:22:39,423 --> 00:22:41,593
AND FAMILIES IVANKA TRUMP AS 

709
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:45,831
WELL HAS MADE IT PART OF HER 

710
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:46,431
PLATFORM SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO 

711
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:47,932
SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING THERE. 

712
00:22:47,932 --> 00:22:48,633
ONE WOULD HOPE IN THE DAYS 

713
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,268
AHEAD THE GOVERNMENT WOULD 

714
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:52,704
ALLOW JOURNALISTS TO HAVE 

715
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,972
ACCESS TO THE FACILITIES TO SEE 

716
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:55,474
MUCH IN THE SAME WAY. 

717
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:56,775
IT'S NO DIFFERENT WHEN FOR 

718
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:59,378
THOSE OF US WHO HAVE COVERED 

719
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,514
NEWS ABROAD WHEN WE WANT TO 

720
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:03,081
VISIT CAMPS OR FACILITIES, 

721
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:04,483
MEDICAL FACILITIES WHERE PEOPLE 

722
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:05,784
WHETHER THEY ARE CHIRP CHILDREN 

723
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,052
OR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE BEING 

724
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,554
HELD AS A RESULT OF WAR, AS A 

725
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:13,992
RESULT OF FAMINE, AS A RESULT 

726
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:14,693
OF NATURAL DISASTERS THE 

727
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:15,894
GOVERNMENTS TYPICALLY LET US 

728
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,896
AND IF THEY DON'T JOURNALISTS 

729
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:18,463
MAKE A BIG STINK ABOUT IT. 

730
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:23,468
THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW 

731
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:24,769
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE AND 

732
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:25,770
GENERALLY WE ARE PROVIDED 

733
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:26,505
ACCESS. 

734
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:27,806
JOURNALISTS ARE NOT ASKING FOR 

735
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,608
SOMETHING UNREASONABLE TO SEE 

736
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:32,878
WHAT IS HAPPENING. 

737
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:33,478
ALMOST EVERY JOURNALIST KNOWS 

738
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:34,479
IF YOU ARE TAKING PHOTOS YOU 

739
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,080
DON'T SHOW THEIR FACES. 

740
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,183
THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE NEW TO 

741
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,016
EXPERIENCED AND SEASONED 

742
00:23:39,016 --> 00:23:40,352
REPORTERS COVERING THE STORY. 

743
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:41,186
>> WE TALKED EARLIER TO A 

744
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:43,388
JOURNALIST WHO HAS BEEN WRITING

ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS 

746
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,693
TO RUN THESE FACILITIES. 

747
00:23:49,693 --> 00:23:50,294
IT'S AN AWFUL A LOT OF MONEY, 

748
00:23:50,294 --> 00:23:50,828
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF 

749
00:23:50,828 --> 00:23:51,462
DOLLARS TO RAMP UP FACILITIES 

750
00:23:51,462 --> 00:23:52,863

DOLLARS. 

752
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,133
WE WANT TO KNOW HOW THAT MONEY 

753
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:55,767
IS BEING SPENT. 

754
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,737
>> HUNTER WALKER WHO REPORTED 

755
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:00,138

00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:05,776
THAT HAVE RECEIVED MILLIONS OF 

759
00:24:05,776 --> 00:24:06,344
DOLLARS FROM THE GOVERNMENT 

760
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:09,781
RAMPING UP IN ANTICIPATION HE 

761
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,482
REPORTS TO THIS POLICY. 

762
00:24:11,482 --> 00:24:13,185
HUNTER, WHILE YOU WERE JUST 

763
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:14,185
TALKING, JUST TEXTED ME AND 

764
00:24:14,185 --> 00:24:16,154
SAID DURING HIS CONVERSATION 

765
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:17,088
WITH US HE MENTIONED THIS IS 

766
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:18,957
JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBURG AND 

767
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:22,594
HIS TEXT WAS JUST FOUND THE 

768
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:23,928
REST OF THE ICEBURG. 

769
00:24:23,928 --> 00:24:24,930
DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS BUT WE 

770
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,464
ARE GOING TO CALL HUNTER AND 

771
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,767
SEE IF HE CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT 

772
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:29,801
HE'S REPORTING. 

773
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,135
>> YEAH THAT WOULD BE GOOD. 

774
00:24:31,135 --> 00:24:32,570
THE DEBATE OVER IMMIGRATION 

775
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,037
CONTINUES TO RAISE. 

776
00:24:33,037 --> 00:24:34,272
THE PRESIDENT WAS MEETING WITH 

777
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:36,341
HIS CABINET AT THE WHITE HOUSE 

778
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:39,311
AND IN CONGRESS THEY HAVE BEEN 

779
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,246
DEBATING AN IMMIGRATION BILL, 

780
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:43,148
SOMETHING CALLED A COMPROMISE 

781
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,049
IMMIGRATION BILL THAT INCLUDES 

782
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:46,084
A COMPONENT THAT PROHIBITS THE 

783
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,552
SEPARATION OF CHILDREN FROM 

784
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:47,919
THEIR FAMILIES. 

785
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,554
OF COURSE NOW WITH THE 

786
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:50,422
PRESIDENT SIGNING THAT 

787
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:51,423
EXECUTIVE ORDER PERHAPS THAT 

788
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:55,427
COMPONENT OF THE BILL IS NOT AS 

789
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:56,561
PRESSING BUT IT NEEDS 

790
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:57,295
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT TO MOVE 

791
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:57,561
FORWARD. 

792
00:24:57,561 --> 00:24:59,097
MAYBE IT CAN GET OUT OF THE 

793
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:01,766
HOUSE BUT IT WON'T MAKE IT 

794
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:03,735
THROUGH THE SENATE WITHOUT 

795
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:04,235
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. 

796
00:25:04,235 --> 00:25:05,403
EVEN BEFORE WE GET TO THAT IT 

797
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:07,539
MAY NOT HAVE THE SUPPORT OF ALL 

798
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:08,706
OF THE REPUBLICANS. 

799
00:25:08,706 --> 00:25:12,043
IT DOES ADDRESS DACA AND IT 

800
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:14,145
DOES GET DACA RECIPIENTENTS A 

801
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:16,281
PATHWAY TO EVENTUALLY GAIN 

802
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:17,616
CITIZENSHIP BUT IT OVERALL 

803
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:20,118
REDUCES NOT ONLY RESTRICTS OR 

804
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:25,457
LIMITED ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION BUT 

805
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:26,358
GREATLY REDUCES LEGAL 

806
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:26,691
IMMIGRATION. 

807
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:27,758
AND THAT'S SORT OF PART OF THE 

808
00:25:27,758 --> 00:25:30,328
REASON WHY DEMOCRATS WILL MOST 

809
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:32,931
LIKELY NOT WANT TO GET BEHIND 

810
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:33,631
THIS WHAT THEY ARE CALLING 

811
00:25:33,631 --> 00:25:34,098
COMPROMISED PIECE OF 

812
00:25:34,098 --> 00:25:34,431
LEGISLATION. 

813
00:25:34,431 --> 00:25:36,067
>> WE ARE GOING TO BE AWAITING 

814
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:37,535
THAT VOTE FROM THE HOUSE, 

815
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,037
SHOULD HAPPEN THIS AFTERNOON 

816
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,005
ABOUT 5:30 OR SO. 

817
00:25:41,005 --> 00:25:42,040
>> YEAH. 

818
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,475
>> WE ARE AWAITING REMARKS OR 

819
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:44,776
IF ANY FROM THE PRESIDENT'S 

820
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:45,609
MEETING WITH THE CABINET. 

821
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:48,413
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS 

822
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:49,748
HAPPENING PROBABLY AS WE SPEAK. 

823
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:53,385
LET'S GO STRAIGHT TO WEIJIA 

824
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:53,918
JANG WHO IS JOINING US. 

825
00:25:53,918 --> 00:25:54,552
SHE COVERS THE WHITE HOUSE FROM 

826
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,821
CBS NEWS AND SHE IS THERE ON 

827
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:57,989
THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN. 

828
00:25:57,989 --> 00:25:59,657
WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING? 

829
00:25:59,657 --> 00:26:01,660
>> WELL THE PRESIDENT JUST MADE 

830
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,461
REMARKS DURING THAT CABINET 

831
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:07,598
MEETING THAT YOU MENTIONED 

832
00:26:07,598 --> 00:26:08,232
ALTHOUGH HE DIDN'T REALLY MAKE 

833
00:26:08,232 --> 00:26:09,366
ANY NEWS AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL 

834
00:26:09,366 --> 00:26:09,934
FROM THE NOTES THAT WE ARE 

835
00:26:09,934 --> 00:26:15,340
GETTING FROM OUR COLLEAGUES WHO 

836
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:15,974
ARE ACTUALLY INSIDE THE ROOM. 

837
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:16,574
HE DID AS EXPECTED TALK ABOUT 

838
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:18,376
IMMIGRATION AGAIN AND HE BLAMED 

839
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:18,810
DEMOCRATS. 

840
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:24,249
THAT HE BLAMED OUR NEIGHBORS, 

841
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,350
HE HE--MEXICO AND TALKED ABOUT 

842
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:30,121
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO MAINTAIN 

843
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:30,688
ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY EVEN 

844
00:26:30,688 --> 00:26:33,725
THOUGH HE MADE THAT MOVE 

845
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:34,292
YESTERDAY THROUGH EXECUTIVE 

846
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:35,159
ACTION TO STOP THE SEPARATION 

847
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:36,127
OF FAMILIES. 

848
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:39,597
WE ALSO KNOW THAT MICK MULVANEY 

849
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:41,466
IS INSIDE THAT MEETING BRIEFING 

850
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:43,267
OTHER CABINET MEMBERS WITH THE 

851
00:26:43,267 --> 00:26:43,935
OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET 

852
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,804
WITH HIS NEW PLAN AND PROPOSAL 

853
00:26:46,804 --> 00:26:47,672
TO ESSENTIALLY SHRINK THE 

854
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:49,407
GOVERNMENT AND WE EXPECT MORE 

855
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:51,443
DETAILS BECAUSE HE WILL HAVE A 

856
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,978
BRIEFING LATER TODAY TO TALK 

857
00:26:53,978 --> 00:26:56,581
ABOUT HOW THE PRESIDENT, HOW HE 

858
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:58,216
WANTS TO PERHAPS COMBINE SOME 

859
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:02,253
DEPARTMENTS SO THAT COULD 

860
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:04,389
REDUCE THE NEED FOR WORKERS AND 

861
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:05,190
FOR BUDGET OF COURSE. 

862
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,460
AND SO WE EXPECT THAT WILL BE A 

863
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,494
MAJOR ISSUE LATER ON TODAY AS 

864
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:09,694
WELL. 

865
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:11,563
BUT CERTAINLY AS YOU GUYS HAVE 

866
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:13,198
BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALL MORNING 

867
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:13,898
IMMIGRATION IS STILL THE KEY 

868
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:15,467
ISSUE HERE AND THE PRESIDENT 

869
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,368
WANTS TO STRESS OVER AND OVER 

870
00:27:17,368 --> 00:27:21,072
AGAIN THAT EVEN THOUGH HE MADE 

871
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:21,672
THAT MOVE YESTERDAY HE IS NOT 

872
00:27:21,672 --> 00:27:23,608
BARKING DOWN AND WE HEARD HIM 

873
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:25,442
AT A RALLY LAST NIGHT PLAYING 

874
00:27:25,442 --> 00:27:27,445
TO HIS BASE REALLY STRESSING 

875
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:30,181
THAT THE BORDER IS STILL SECURE 

876
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,949
AND TALKING RELATIVELY LITTLE 

877
00:27:31,949 --> 00:27:32,617
ABUT KEEPING THESE FAMILIES 

878
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:32,884
TOGETHER. 

879
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:35,687
>> IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE GETTING 

880
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:36,888
VIDEO FROM THAT CABINET MEETING 

881
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:44,129
SO WE ARE GOING TO PIVOT OVER 

882
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:44,562
TO THAT, THANK YOU. 

883
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:45,563
>> HELLO, EVERYBODY. 

884
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:48,966
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING 

885
00:27:48,966 --> 00:27:49,167
HERE. 

886
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:49,767
THIS IS A CABINET MEETING AND 

887
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:50,368
WE HAVE PLENTY OF THINGS TO 

888
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:52,370
DISCUSS AND PLENTY OF SUCCESS. 

889
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:56,907
WE'VE HAD A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT 

890
00:27:56,907 --> 00:27:57,208
OF SUCCESS. 

891
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:57,808
WE'RE WORKING, HOWEVER, RIGHT 

892
00:27:57,808 --> 00:27:58,977
NOW ON IMMIGRATION WHICH HAS 

893
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:01,545
BEEN GOING ON FOR MANY YEARS. 

894
00:28:01,545 --> 00:28:03,180
WE HAVE COME UP WITH A LOT OF 

895
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,516
SOLUTIONS BUT WE HAVE DEMOCRATS 

896
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,418
THAT DON'T WANT TO APPROVE 

897
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:07,552
ANYTHING BECAUSE THAT'S 

898
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,753
PROBABLY THEY THINK BAD FOR THE 

899
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:09,320
ELECTION THAT'S COMING UP. 

900
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,090
UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE A LOT 

901
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:16,561
OF PEOPLE SUFFERING AND THAT'S 

902
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:16,961
UNFORTUNATE. 

903
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:19,564
UNRELATED AND BEFORE WE GET 

904
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:21,666
INTO THAT, THE NEW EMPLOYMENT 

905
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:22,500
CLAIMS RECENTLY OUT JUST 

906
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,536
YESTERDAY SHOW THAT WE HAVE THE 

907
00:28:25,536 --> 00:28:29,507
LOWEST LEVEL IN NEARLY A HALF 

908
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:33,244
CENTURY AT SOMETHING THAT IS AN 

909
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:35,947
INCREDIBLE STATISTIC, IN HALF A 

910
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:36,214
CENTURY. 

911
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:36,647
THAT'S A LONG TIME. 

912
00:28:36,647 --> 00:28:39,017
AND THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING. 

913
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:39,517
IT'S DOING REALLY WELL. 

914
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:41,118
WE ARE NEGOTIATING TRADE DEALS. 

915
00:28:41,118 --> 00:28:44,822
WE ARE DOING VERY WELL IN THOSE 

916
00:28:44,822 --> 00:28:45,557
TRADE DEALS. 

917
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:49,160
IT'S TAKING A LITTLE PERIOD OF 

918
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,463
TIME. 

919
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:55,333
WE PUT TARIFFS ON CERTAIN 

920
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:55,800
COUNTRIES AND CERTAIN 

921
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,434
INDUSTRIES WHERE IT'S BEEN VERY 

922
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:57,035
UNFAIR TO THE UNITED STATES. 

923
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:57,635
OUR TREASURY IS TAKING IN 

924
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:59,504
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND THESE 

925
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:00,972
OTHER COUNTRIES ARE COMING 

926
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:04,409
ALONG THAT HAVE NOT TREATED US 

927
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:08,546
WELL AND THEY ARE NEGOTIATING 

928
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:09,113
VERY VIGOROUSLY AND LOTS OF 

929
00:29:09,113 --> 00:29:09,680
GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING. 

930
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,348
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN 

931
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:14,052
CARE OF A LONG TIME BEFORE MY 

932
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:15,053
ADMINISTRATION CAME INTO BEING 

933
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,955
BUT FOR SOME REASON FOR 25 TO 

934
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:18,456
30 YEARS, NOBODY EVER LOOKED AT 

935
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:19,090
TRADE DEALS. 

936
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,358
THEY ARE OUT OF CONTROL HOW BAD 

937
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:21,725
THEY ARE BUT WE ARE GOING TO 

938
00:29:21,725 --> 00:29:24,963
MAKE THEM VERY GOOD AND WE ARE 

939
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:27,498
GOING TO MAKE THEM FAIR FOR 

940
00:29:27,498 --> 00:29:28,132
BOTH COUNTRIES FOR OUR COUNTRY 

941
00:29:28,132 --> 00:29:29,501
AND WHICH EVER COUNTRY WE ARE 

942
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:31,269
DEALING WITH AND THERE ARE 

943
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,938
PLENTY OF THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE 

944
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,273
ALL BAD. 

945
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,574
THERE'S NOTHING GOOD. 

946
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,376
MY ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO 

947
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:39,711
ACTING SWIFTLY TO ADDRESS THE 

948
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:41,112
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION CRISIS ON 

949
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:41,846
THE SOUTHERN BORDER. 

950
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:44,382
LOOP HOLES IN OUR IMMIGRATION 

951
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:47,218
LAWS ALL SUPPORTED BY EXTREMIST 

952
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:47,751
OPEN BORDER DEMOCRATS AND 

953
00:29:47,751 --> 00:29:50,154
THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE. 

954
00:29:50,154 --> 00:29:51,422
THEY ARE EXTREMIST OPEN BORDER 

955
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:51,722
DEMOCRATS. 

956
00:29:51,722 --> 00:29:54,025
IF YOU LOOK AT NANCY PELOSI OR 

957
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:55,459
CHUCK SCHUMER YOU'LL SEE TAPES 

958
00:29:55,459 --> 00:29:57,695
WHERE THEY WANTED TO HAVE 

959
00:29:57,695 --> 00:29:58,229
BORDERS. 

960
00:29:58,229 --> 00:29:59,430
THEY NEEDED BORDERS FOR 

961
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,465
SECURITY JUST A SHORT WHILE 

962
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,332
AGO. 

963
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:03,368
A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO I SEE 

964
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,503
CHUCK SCHUMER WE MUST HAVE 

965
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:05,770
BORDERS. 

966
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,538
HILARY CLINTON WE MUST HAVE 

967
00:30:07,538 --> 00:30:09,240
BORDERS AND PEOPLE PENETRATE 

968
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,243
OUR BORDERS WE MUST GET THEM 

969
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:13,945
OUT OF OUR COUNTY NOW ALL OF A 

970
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,513
SUDDEN THEY ARE BIG OPEN BORDER 

971
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:15,746
PEOPLE. 

972
00:30:15,746 --> 00:30:18,650
IT'S A CON JOB AND PEOPLE ARE 

973
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,718
SUFFERING BECAUSE OF THE 

974
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:21,018
DEMOCRATS. 

975
00:30:21,018 --> 00:30:21,552
SO WHAT WE'VE CREATED AND 

976
00:30:21,552 --> 00:30:23,554
THEY'VE CREATED AND THEY'VE LET 

977
00:30:23,554 --> 00:30:26,691
IT HAPPEN A MASSIVE CHILD 

978
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:29,560
SMUGGLING INDUSTRY IS EXACTLY 

979
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,761
WHAT IT'S BECOME. 

980
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:32,297
TRAFFICKERS, THINK ABOUT THIS, 

981
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:38,769
HUMAN TRAFFICKERS ARE MAKING A 

982
00:30:38,769 --> 00:30:39,270
FORTUNATE--FORTUNE. 

983
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:39,670
IT'S A DISGRACE. 

984
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,239
THESE LOOP HOLES FORCE THE 

985
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:42,674
RELEASE OF ALIEN FAMILIES AND 

986
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:47,545
MINORS INTO THE COUNTRY WHETHER 

987
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:49,647
THEY LEGALLY CROSS THE BORDER. 

988
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,649
SINCE 2014 ALONE, NEARLY 

989
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:52,683
200,000 UNACCOMPANIED ALIEN 

990
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:53,651
MINORS HAVE BEEN RELEASED INTO 

991
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:57,021
THE UNITED STATES AS A RESULT 

992
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,256
OF DEMOCRAT BACKED LOOP HOLES 

993
00:30:58,256 --> 00:30:58,856
INCLUDING CATCH AND RELEASE 

994
00:30:58,856 --> 00:31:00,424
WHICH IS ONE OF THE WORST. 

995
00:31:00,424 --> 00:31:02,794
YOU CATCH THEM AND THEN YOU 

996
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:03,127
RELEASE THEM. 

997
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:05,596
MIGHT AS WELL SAVE YOUR TIME 

998
00:31:05,596 --> 00:31:06,331
AND DON'T BOTHER CATCHING THEM. 

999
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:10,501
AND THIS IS WHAT WE ARE STUCK 

1000
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:10,701
WITH. 

1001
00:31:10,701 --> 00:31:11,335
THEY'RE THE WORST IMMIGRATION 

1002
00:31:11,335 --> 00:31:11,969
LATCHES IN THE HISTORY OF THE 

1003
00:31:11,969 --> 00:31:12,370
WORLD. 

1004
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,638
THE WHOLE WORLD IS LAUGHING AT 

1005
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:17,542
THE UNITED STATES AND THEY HAVE 

1006
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:17,975
BEEN FOR YEARS. 

1007
00:31:17,975 --> 00:31:18,776
THESE ALIEN MINORS WERE 

1008
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:21,880
SEPARATED AND SENT ALL THE WAY 

1009
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,484
UP HERE ALONE BUT THEY REALLY 

1010
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:29,220
CAME UP WITH COYOTES. 

1011
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,322
YOU KNOW WHAT A COYOTE IS? 

1012
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:31,589
NOT GOOD. 

1013
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:32,991
THESE ARE NOT GOOD PEOPLE. 

1014
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:39,564
THEY WERE SENT UP HERE WITH 

1015
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,098
HUMAN TRAFFICKERS BECAUSE THE 

1016
00:31:41,098 --> 00:31:41,665
DEMOCRAT SUPPORTED POLICIES 

1017
00:31:41,665 --> 00:31:42,633
HAVE ALLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN. 

1018
00:31:42,633 --> 00:31:44,935
DEMOCRATS ALSO REFUSE TO FUND 

1019
00:31:44,935 --> 00:31:46,204
THE PERSONNEL, THE BED SPACE, 

1020
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:48,305
THE RESOURCES THAT WE NEED TO 

1021
00:31:48,305 --> 00:31:48,705
HOUSE THE MINORS. 

1022
00:31:48,705 --> 00:31:50,541
NOW THEY WANT US TO TAKE CARE 

1023
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,343
OF THE MINORS AND THAT'S FINE 

1024
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:54,712
BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE US 

1025
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:57,048
THE MONEY TO TAKE CARE OF THEM 

1026
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:57,682
BECAUSE THE WORSE EVERYTHING 

1027
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:58,549
LOOKS THEY THINK THE BETTER 

1028
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:00,050
THEY ARE GOING TO DO WITH 

1029
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:00,852
RESPECT TO THE BLUE WAVE WHICH 

1030
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:03,054
IS TURNING OUT FRANKLY TO BE A 

1031
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:04,989
RED WAVE IF YOU LOOK AT THE 

1032
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:05,923
POLLS I THINK WE ARE GOING TO 

1033
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:07,391
HAVE A RED WAVE NOT A BLUE WAVE 

1034
00:32:07,391 --> 00:32:10,995
SO THEY WANT US TO TAKE CARE OF 

1035
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:12,263
BED SPACE AND RESOURCES AND 

1036
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:15,366
PERSONNEL AND TAKE EVERYBODY 

1037
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:16,433
AND LIKE LET'S RUN THE MOST 

1038
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:17,034
LUXURIOUS HOTEL IN THE WORLD 

1039
00:32:17,034 --> 00:32:17,401
FOR EVERYBODY. 

1040
00:32:17,401 --> 00:32:20,604
BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE US 

1041
00:32:20,604 --> 00:32:20,904
THE MONEY. 

1042
00:32:20,904 --> 00:32:23,241
SO YOU CAN ASK THEM ABOUT THAT. 

1043
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:26,577
WE HAVE TO HOUSE THESE MINORS 

1044
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,279
AND WE HAVE TO HOUSE THEM 

1045
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,149
SAFELY AND FRANKLY WE HAVE TO 

1046
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:31,749
HOUSE THEM AND WE SHOULD BE 

1047
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:34,385
TAKING GOOD CARE OF THEM AND 

1048
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:35,686
THEN WE SHOULD RETURN THEM BACK 

1049
00:32:35,686 --> 00:32:38,356
HOME. 

1050
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:38,923
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. 

1051
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:39,557
BUT EVERY TIME WE ASK FOR 

1052
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:41,626
RESOURCES, THE DEMOCRATS SAY 

1053
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,361
NO. 

1054
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:44,662
THEY SAY NO TO EVERYTHING. 

1055
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:46,097
THEY ARE OBSTRUCTIONISTS 

1056
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:47,632
BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT'S GOOD 

1057
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,699
POLITICALLY. 

1058
00:32:48,699 --> 00:32:51,602
I THINK IT'S BAD FOR THEM 

1059
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:53,471
POLITICALLY I WILL SAY. 

1060
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:57,141
IN ADDITION DEMOCRAT AND COURT 

1061
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:57,909
ORDERED LOOP HOLES PREVENT 

1062
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:58,509
FAMILY DETENTION AND LEAD TO 

1063
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:01,812
FAMILY SEPARATION NO MATTER HOW 

1064
00:33:01,812 --> 00:33:02,847
YOU CUT IT. 

1065
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:03,514
I SIGNED A VERY GOOD EXECUTIVE 

1066
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:04,081
ORDER YESTERDAY BUT THAT'S 

1067
00:33:04,081 --> 00:33:05,516
TOTALLY LIMITED NO MATTER HOW 

1068
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:09,988
YOU CUT IT, IT LEADS TO 

1069
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:10,488
SEPARATION ULTIMATELY. 

1070
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,557
I'M DIRECTLY HHS, DHS AND DOJ 

1071
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:13,992
TO WORK TOGETHER TO KEEP 

1072
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:17,595
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT FAMILIES 

1073
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,330
TOGETHER DURING THE IMMIGRATION 

1074
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,100
PROCESS AND TO REUNITE THESE 

1075
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,400
PREVIOUSLY SEPARATED GROUPS. 

1076
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,770
BUT THE ONLY REAL SOLUTION IS 

1077
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:26,404
FOR CONGRESS TO CLOSE THE CATCH 

1078
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:30,208
AND RELEASE LOOP HOLES THAT 

1079
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:31,742
HAVE FUELED THE CHILD SMUGGLING 

1080
00:33:31,742 --> 00:33:32,477
INDUSTRY. 

1081
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:34,245
THE DEMOCRATS ARE CAUSING 

1082
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:38,382
TREMENDOUS DAMAGE AND 

1083
00:33:38,382 --> 00:33:39,516
DESTRUCTION AND LIVES BY NOT 

1084
00:33:39,516 --> 00:33:42,286
DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THIS AND 

1085
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:42,853
THEY KNOW THAT BETTER THAN 

1086
00:33:42,853 --> 00:33:45,889
ANYBODY OUT THERE WITH A PEN. 

1087
00:33:45,889 --> 00:33:47,592
IF WE DON'T CLOSE THESE LOOP 

1088
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:50,027
HOLES THERE'S NO AMOUNT OF 

1089
00:33:50,027 --> 00:33:51,662
MONEY OR PERSONNEL IN THE WORLD 

1090
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:52,296
TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS. 

1091
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:55,166
IT'S A VERY SERIOUS CRISIS. 

1092
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:55,766
IT'S BEEN GOING ON SO LONG. 

1093
00:33:55,766 --> 00:33:56,867
THIS ISN'T TRUMP 

1094
00:33:56,867 --> 00:33:57,267
ADMINISTRATION. 

1095
00:33:57,267 --> 00:34:00,438
YOU LOOK BACK AT 2014 DURING 

1096
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:01,072
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, THEY 

1097
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:03,774
HAVE PICTURES THAT WERE SO BAD 

1098
00:34:03,774 --> 00:34:04,842
THEY HAD A JUDGE THAT SAID IT 

1099
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:07,145
WAS INHUMANE THE WAY THEY WERE 

1100
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:07,578
TREATING CHILDREN. 

1101
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:09,580
TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE 

1102
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,650
COURT RULINGS AGAINST THE OBAMA 

1103
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,016
ADMINISTRATION. 

1104
00:34:13,016 --> 00:34:14,652
THEY TALKED ABOUT INHUMANE 

1105
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:15,286
TREATMENT. 

1106
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:15,619
I READ THEM. 

1107
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:18,222
I LOOKED AT THEM. 

1108
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,822
THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE. 

1109
00:34:19,822 --> 00:34:20,690
INHUMANE TREATMENT. 

1110
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:21,458
THEY WERE TREATING THEM 

1111
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:21,726
TERRIBLY. 

1112
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,562
WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE SOME 

1113
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:27,364
OF THESE PLACES THEY REALLY ARE 

1114
00:34:27,364 --> 00:34:30,935
RUNNING THEM WELL AND I GIVE A 

1115
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:31,536
LOT OF CREDIT TO SECRETARY 

1116
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:34,272
NIELSON AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE 

1117
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:34,672
THAT HAVE WORKED. 

1118
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:36,808
IT'S NICE THAT PEOPLE HAVE SEEN 

1119
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:39,643
BUT IT'S STILL SOMETHING THAT 

1120
00:34:39,643 --> 00:34:40,678
SHOULDN'T BE TAKING PLACE. 

1121
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:42,746
MY WIFE AND FIRST LADY IS DOWN 

1122
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:45,148
NOW AT THE BORDER BECAUSE IT 

1123
00:34:45,148 --> 00:34:45,681
REALLY BOTHERED HER TO BE 

1124
00:34:45,681 --> 00:34:47,452
LOOKING AT THIS AND SEEING IT 

1125
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:51,556
AS IT BOTHERED ME, AS IT 

1126
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:52,322
BOTHERED EVERYBODY AT THIS 

1127
00:34:52,322 --> 00:34:52,556
TABLE. 

1128
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:55,460
WE ARE ALL BOTHERED BY IT. 

1129
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,161
BUT WE NEED TWO TO TANGO. 

1130
00:34:58,161 --> 00:35:00,331
WE HAVE 51 VOTES IN THE SENATE. 

1131
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:02,166
WE NEED 60 UNFORTUNATELY 

1132
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:05,603
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE RIDICULOUS 

1133
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,003
FILIBUSTER RULE. 

1134
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:06,370
SO WE NEED 60. 

1135
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,839
AND I THINK I'LL GET FOUR OR 

1136
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:11,641
FIVE OR SIX FROM SENATORS 

1137
00:35:11,641 --> 00:35:14,011
FRANKLY RUNNING IN STATES WHERE 

1138
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:16,413
I WON BY 25 TO 30 POINTS. 

1139
00:35:16,413 --> 00:35:19,083
AND I THINK WE'LL GET SIX 

1140
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,318
SENATORS MAYBE SEVEN BUT THAT 

1141
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:22,620
STILL DOESN'T GET US TO 60 SO 

1142
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,220
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO 

1143
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,755
GET THERE AND PEOPLE DON'T 

1144
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:25,155
UNDERSTAND THAT. 

1145
00:35:25,155 --> 00:35:27,124
WHEN WE HAVE A MAJORITY IN THE 

1146
00:35:27,124 --> 00:35:29,560
SENATE WE HAVE A MAJORITY BY 

1147
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,598
ONE BUT WE NEED TEN VOTES. 

1148
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:35,933
SO WE NEED TEN ESSENTIALLY--WE 

1149
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:36,366
NEED TEN DEMOCRATS. 

1150
00:35:36,366 --> 00:35:38,803
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET THEM. 

1151
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,638
THEY'RE TOLD BY SCHUMER AND 

1152
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:41,539
PELOSI DON'T DO IT BECAUSE WE 

1153
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:43,774
WANT TO SEE IF WE CAN PICK UP 

1154
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:44,008
SEATS. 

1155
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:45,009
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE 

1156
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:45,276
CHILDREN. 

1157
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:46,844
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE 

1158
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:47,077
INJURY. 

1159
00:35:47,077 --> 00:35:48,446
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE 

1160
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:48,746
PROBLEMS. 

1161
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:51,448
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING. 

1162
00:35:51,448 --> 00:35:52,616
ALL THEY DO IS SAY OBSTRUCT AND 

1163
00:35:52,616 --> 00:35:54,518
LET'S SEE HOW WE DO BECAUSE 

1164
00:35:54,518 --> 00:35:57,654
THEY HAVE NO POLICIES THAT ARE 

1165
00:35:57,654 --> 00:35:58,756
ANY GOOD. 

1166
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,491
THEY ARE NOT GOOD POLITICIANS. 

1167
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:01,058
THEY'VE GOT NOTHING GOING. 

1168
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:03,461
ALL THEY ARE GOOD AT IS 

1169
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:04,462
OBSTRUCTING AND THEY GENERALLY 

1170
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:04,862
STICK TOGETHER. 

1171
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:08,999
I RESPECT THEM FOR THAT. 

1172
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:09,399
THAT'S ABOUT IT. 

1173
00:36:09,399 --> 00:36:09,900
THEIR POLICIES STINK. 

1174
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,936
THEY'RE NO GOOD. 

1175
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,004
NO IDEAS, NO NOTHING, THE 

1176
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:13,304
DEMOCRATS. 

1177
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:15,072
ALL THEY CAN DO IS OBSTRUCT AND 

1178
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:15,706
STAY TOGETHER AND VOTE AGAINST 

1179
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:17,642
TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO TAKE 

1180
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:18,743
CARE OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES 

1181
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,544
AND TO TAKE CARE OF 

1182
00:36:20,544 --> 00:36:20,877
IMMIGRATION. 

1183
00:36:20,877 --> 00:36:22,847
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE AN 

1184
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:23,614
IMMIGRATION BILL THAT CAN 

1185
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,850
REALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM NOT 

1186
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,618
JUST--THIS IS ONE ASPECT OF IT. 

1187
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:29,220
THIS IS ONE VERY IMPORTANT BUT 

1188
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:29,953
SMALL ASPECT OF IT. 

1189
00:36:29,953 --> 00:36:32,322
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO A BILL. 

1190
00:36:32,322 --> 00:36:34,224
I'D INVITE THEM TO COME OVER TO 

1191
00:36:34,224 --> 00:36:35,693
THE WHITE HOUSE ANY TIME THEY 

1192
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,060
WANT. 

1193
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,095
THIS AFTERNOON WOULD BE GOOD 

1194
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:40,298
AFTER THE CABINET MEETING WOULD 

1195
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:40,564
BE GOOD. 

1196
00:36:40,564 --> 00:36:41,665
THEY ARE INVITED OFFICIALLY. 

1197
00:36:41,665 --> 00:36:43,534
I'LL LET YOU DO THE INVITING. 

1198
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,001
LET THE PRESS DO THE INVITING. 

1199
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:47,438
BUT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING 

1200
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:49,640
ABOUT IMMIGRATION IN THIS 

1201
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:49,907
COUNTRY. 

1202
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:51,542
FOR 50 YEARS AND LONG BEFORE 

1203
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,544
THAT IT WAS A DISASTER. 

1204
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:58,148
BUT OVER THE LAST 20 TO 25 

1205
00:36:58,148 --> 00:36:58,682
YEARS IT'S GOTTEN WORSE. 

1206
00:36:58,682 --> 00:37:00,585
EVERY TIME THEY WRITE A RULE OR 

1207
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,620
REGULATION IT MAKES IT WORSE 

1208
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,487
NOT BETTER. 

1209
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:06,857
WE CAN SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. 

1210
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:07,458
WE HAVE TO HIRE THOUSANDS OF 

1211
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:07,692
JUDGES. 

1212
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:09,760
NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD IS 

1213
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,795
HIRING JUDGES LIKE THAT. 

1214
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,830
THEY HIRE BORDER PEOPLE SO YOU 

1215
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,098
CAN'T COME INTO THE COUNTRY. 

1216
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:15,298
MEXICO BY THE WAY IS DOING 

1217
00:37:15,298 --> 00:37:16,767
NOTHING FOR US THEM HAVE THE 

1218
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:17,935
STRONGEST IMMIGRATION LAWS THEY 

1219
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:20,270
CAN KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF MEXICO. 

1220
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:22,573
THEY HAVE A 2,000-MILE JOURNEY 

1221
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:22,973
OF MEXICO. 

1222
00:37:22,973 --> 00:37:24,775
THEY WALK THROUGH MEXICO LIKE 

1223
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:27,311
IT'S WALKING THROUGH CENTRAL 

1224
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:27,511
PARK. 

1225
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:27,911
IT'S RIDICULOUS. 

1226
00:37:27,911 --> 00:37:28,512
MEXICO DOES NOTHING FOR US SO 

1227
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:31,549
THAT WHEN PEOPLE SAY WHY ARE 

1228
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:34,018
YOU BEING SO TOUGH WITH NAFTA 

1229
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,652
AND I AM BEING TOUGH BECAUSE 

1230
00:37:35,652 --> 00:37:38,923
IT'S A TERRIBLE DEAL FOR THE 

1231
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:39,290
UNITED STATES. 

1232
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,659
MEXICO IS MAKING $100 BILLION A 

1233
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:47,731
YEAR OFF US AND THE HORRIBLE 

1234
00:37:47,731 --> 00:37:48,265
NAFTA DEAL AND I AM BEING 

1235
00:37:48,265 --> 00:37:48,499
TOUGH. 

1236
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:49,099
ONE OF THE REASONS I'M BEING 

1237
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:51,502
TOUGH IS BECAUSE THEY DO 

1238
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:52,503
NOTHING FOR US AT THE BORDER. 

1239
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:55,072
THEY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO WALK 

1240
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,641
THROUGH MEXICO AND GO TO THE 

1241
00:37:57,641 --> 00:37:59,009
UNITED STATES. 

1242
00:37:59,009 --> 00:38:00,344
THEY ARE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, 

1243
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:01,912
HUMAN TRAFFICKERS, COYOTES. 

1244
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:04,615
WE ARE GETTING SOME REAL 

1245
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:04,882
BEAUTIES. 

1246
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:05,850
MEXICO IS DOING NOTHING FOR US 

1247
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,518
EXCEPT TAKING OUR MONEY AND 

1248
00:38:08,518 --> 00:38:10,454
SENDING US DRUGS. 

1249
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:10,954
THEY'RE DOING NOTHING. 

1250
00:38:10,954 --> 00:38:11,889
THEY COULD SOLVE THIS PROBLEM 

1251
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,824
IN TWO MINUTES YOU WOULDN'T 

1252
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:16,861
EVEN HAVE TO DO ANYTHING BUT 

1253
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:17,294
THEY DON'T DO IT. 

1254
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:18,629
THEY TALK A GOOD GAME BUT THEY 

1255
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:22,867
DON'T DO IT SO WE'LL SEE HOW 

1256
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:23,434
THAT ALL COMES OUT. 

1257
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:24,068
IT WILL BE VERY INTERESTING TO 

1258
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:24,268
SEE. 

1259
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:25,335
SO WITH THAT I'LL END BY SAYING 

1260
00:38:25,335 --> 00:38:30,174
WE HAD A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS IN 

1261
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:31,475
NORTH KOREA. 

1262
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:38,148
WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT. 

1263
00:38:38,148 --> 00:38:40,251
MIKE POMPEO HAS BEEN FANTASTIC. 

1264
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:40,918
JOHN BOLTON WORKING TOGETHER 

1265
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:43,354
WITH MIKE HAS BEEN FANTASTIC. 

1266
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:44,888
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE HE IS. 

1267
00:38:44,888 --> 00:38:45,623
THERE HE IS. 

1268
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:47,458
HE SPENT SO MUCH TIME IN NORTH 

1269
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,326
KOREA, SURPRISED TO SEE YOU 

1270
00:38:49,326 --> 00:38:49,694
HERE. 

1271
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:51,962
BUT I CAN SPEAK FOR BOTH OF US 

1272
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:55,065
IN SAYING IT'S BEEN AN 

1273
00:38:55,065 --> 00:38:56,934
INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE. 

1274
00:38:56,934 --> 00:39:02,072
THE RELATIONSHIP IS VERY GOOD. 

1275
00:39:02,072 --> 00:39:03,541
THEY'VE STOPPED THE SENDING OF 

1276
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,241
MISSILES INCLUDING BALLISTIC 

1277
00:39:05,241 --> 00:39:05,643
MISSILES. 

1278
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,545
THEY HAVE DESTROYING THEIR 

1279
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:08,979
ENGINE SITE. 

1280
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:09,813
THEY ARE BLOWING IT UP. 

1281
00:39:09,813 --> 00:39:11,482
THEY'VE ALREADY BLOWN UP FOUR 

1282
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:12,983
OF THEIR BIG TEST SITES AND THE 

1283
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:20,758
BIG THING IS IT WILL BE A TOTAL 

1284
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:21,291
DENUCLEARIZATION WHICH IS 

1285
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:21,925
ALREADY STARTING TO TAKE PLACE 

1286
00:39:21,925 --> 00:39:22,526
AND I UNDERSTAND, MIKE, THAT 

1287
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,461
THEY'VE ALREADY SENT BACK OR 

1288
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:24,762
ARE IN THE PROCESS OF SENDING 

1289
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:27,631
BACK THE REMAINS OF OUR GREAT 

1290
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:33,370
HEROS WHO DIED IN NORTH KOREA 

1291
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:33,871
DURING THE WAR. 

1292
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:34,405
AND THAT'S ALREADY IN THE 

1293
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:34,905
PROCESS OF COMING BACK. 

1294
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:36,974
PLUS AS YOU ALL KNOW WE GOT 

1295
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:38,676
BACK OUR HOSTAGES OUR THREE 

1296
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:40,945
HOSTAGES WHO ARE RIGHT NOW 

1297
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:42,446
LIVING VERY HAPPILY WITH THEIR 

1298
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:44,782
FAMILIES AND WE ARE VERY HAPPY 

1299
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:45,449
ABOUT THAT. 

1300
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:46,751
SO WE'VE MADE TREMENDOUS 

1301
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,419
PROGRESS WITH RESPECT TO NORTH 

1302
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:51,555
KOREA EVEN SINCE I LAST SPOKE 

1303
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,022
TO YOU. 

1304
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:53,023
WHAT WE AGREE TO DO IS HAVE A 

1305
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:53,290
MEETING. 

1306
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,959
I KNOW THAT SOME OF THE MEDIA 

1307
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:56,894
SAYS OH THEY AGREED TO MEET. 

1308
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:59,463
ANYBODY WOULD HAVE AGREED TO 

1309
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:23,821
MEET AND IT 

1310
00:40:25,488 --> 00:40:26,556
HE SAID I WANT TO THANK YOU 

1311
00:40:26,556 --> 00:40:29,459
BECAUSE WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IS 

1312
00:40:29,459 --> 00:40:29,760
INCREDIBLE. 

1313
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,428
THERE ARE NO MORE ROCKETS 

1314
00:40:31,428 --> 00:40:31,662
GOING. 

1315
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:34,498
THERE IS NO THOUGHT OF IT. 

1316
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:35,432
THINGS CAN CHANGE. 

1317
00:40:35,432 --> 00:40:39,003
PERSONALTIES CAN CHANGE. 

1318
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:47,445
MAYBE END UP WITH CONFLICT, 

1319
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:53,317
MAYBE YOU DON'T. 

1320
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:55,419
THE DOCUMENT WE SIGNED -- IF 

1321
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:56,953
PEOPLE READ IT TO THE PUBLIC 

1322
00:40:56,953 --> 00:41:01,191
YOU WOULD SEE THE NUMBER ONE 

1323
00:41:01,191 --> 00:41:04,895
STATEMENT, WE WILL IMMEDIATELY 

1324
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:05,562
BEGIN TOTAL DENUCLEARIZATION OF 

1325
00:41:05,562 --> 00:41:05,896
NORTH KOREA. 

1326
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:07,063
NOBODY THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE 

1327
00:41:07,063 --> 00:41:07,330
POSSIBLE. 

1328
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:09,032
IF YOU REMEMBER A YEAR AND A 

1329
00:41:09,032 --> 00:41:10,934
HALF AGO WHEN MIKE AND I CAME 

1330
00:41:10,934 --> 00:41:12,636
INTO OFFICE AND WHEN THIS GROUP 

1331
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,405
CAME INTO OFFICE, EVERYBODY WAS 

1332
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:17,541
TALKING ABOUT THERE IS GOING TO 

1333
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:18,341
BE A WAR WITH NORTH KOREA. 

1334
00:41:18,341 --> 00:41:21,478
DURING THE OBAMA YEAR'S ALL I 

1335
00:41:21,478 --> 00:41:23,547
HEARD ABOUT WAS WAR WITH NORTH 

1336
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:23,780
KOREA. 

1337
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:29,553
YOU HAVE 28 MILLION PEOPLE 30- 

1338
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:34,024
MILES AWAY FROM THE BORDER THAT 

1339
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:34,357
HAVE CANNONS. 

1340
00:41:34,357 --> 00:41:36,827
THEY ARE ALL NAMED AT SEOUL. 

1341
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,863
SEOUL HAS 28 MILLION PEOPLE. 

1342
00:41:39,863 --> 00:41:43,567
IT WOULD BE NOT A CATASTROPHE 

1343
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:46,203
OF 100,000 PEOPLE OR 200,000 -- 

1344
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:50,808
LIKE I WOULD READ -- THIS COULD 

1345
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:51,441
HAVE BEEN A CATASTROPHE OF 50 

1346
00:41:51,441 --> 00:41:51,842
MILLION PEOPLE. 

1347
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,812
I THINK WE ARE VERY CLOSE TO 

1348
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:55,546
HAVING THAT SITUATION SOLVED. 

1349
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:59,416
WE HAVE HAD VERY GOOD NEWS OVER 

1350
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:00,150
THE LAST COUPLE DAYS. 

1351
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,518
THEY WANT TO GET IT DONE. 

1352
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:05,022
WE WANT TO GET IT DONE. 

1353
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:05,688
WE ARE MOVING QUICKLY. 

1354
00:42:05,688 --> 00:42:08,558
NORTH KOREA HAS BEEN AN 

1355
00:42:08,558 --> 00:42:11,562
INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE FOR ME. 

1356
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:13,430
WE'LL HELP THEM GET BACK ON 

1357
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:13,663
TRACK. 

1358
00:42:13,663 --> 00:42:17,534
WE THINK IT HAS TREMENDOUS 

1359
00:42:17,534 --> 00:42:17,834
POTENTIAL. 

1360
00:42:17,834 --> 00:42:19,470
CHAIRMAN KIM THINKS IT HAS 

1361
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:19,937
TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL. 

1362
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:23,707
I WANT TO THANK THE PRIME 

1363
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,075
MINISTER AND PRESIDENT NOON 

1364
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:26,010
FROM SOUTH KOREA. 

1365
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,144
HE'S BEEN TERRIFIC AND REALLY 

1366
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:29,113
MOVING IT ALONG AND PUSHING AS 

1367
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:30,013
HARD AS THEY CAN. 

1368
00:42:30,013 --> 00:42:31,181
BE WITHOUT THE UNITED STATES IT 

1369
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:35,119
HAD NO CHANCE WHAT SO EVER. 

1370
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,821
I WANTED TO THANK PRESIDENT CHI 

1371
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:40,290
OF SHINE BECAUSE THE BORDER WAS 

1372
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:42,592
STRONG DURING A CRITICAL 

1373
00:42:42,592 --> 00:42:42,826
PERIOD. 

1374
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:46,730
UNFORTUNATELY THE BORDER IS 

1375
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,765
GETTING WEAKER NOW BUT THAT'S 

1376
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:47,965
OKAY. 

1377
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:51,101
WE HAVE TO KEEP IT TOUGH. 

1378
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:53,269
I WANT TO THANK THE PRESIDENT 

1379
00:42:53,269 --> 00:42:53,536
OF CHINA. 

1380
00:42:53,536 --> 00:42:55,038
WITH ALL OF THAT WE ARE HAVING 

1381
00:42:55,038 --> 00:42:56,173
TREMENDOUS NUMBERS AND 

1382
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:56,773
TREMENDOUS ECONOMIC SUCCESS. 

1383
00:42:56,773 --> 00:43:02,546
I THINK WE ARE HAVING THE MOST 

1384
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:04,515
SUCCESSFUL PERIOD OF TIME, 

1385
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:06,416
ECONOMICALLY, PERHAPS IN OUR 

1386
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:06,850
COUNTRY'S HISTORY. 

1387
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,752
GPD NUMBERS HAVE BEEN GREAT. 

1388
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,687
I'LL REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO 

1389
00:43:10,687 --> 00:43:16,126
SEEING THE ONES COMING OUT. 

1390
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:17,995
I JUST SEE THE ACTIVITY -- 

1391
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:20,898
YESTERDAY AND LAST EVENING WAS 

1392
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:21,999
AN INCREDIBLE EVENING WE SPENT. 

1393
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:25,535
TO ME, THAT WAS JUST AN 

1394
00:43:25,535 --> 00:43:26,002
INCREDIBLE EVENING. 

1395
00:43:26,002 --> 00:43:27,170
A LOT OF YOU WERE THERE. 

1396
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:31,141
I SEE A LOT OF THE FACES. 

1397
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:33,711
A LOT OF YOU WERE THERE. 

1398
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:36,079
15,000 PEOPLE COULD NOT GET IN 

1399
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,849
THE ARENA. 

1400
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:41,218
THE ARENA WAS BIG. 

1401
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:41,918
IT HELD 19,000 PEOPLE. 

1402
00:43:41,918 --> 00:43:44,121
SADLY 15,000 PEOPLE COULD NOT 

1403
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:44,955
GET IN THE THE ARENA. 

1404
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,791
IT WAS A SPECIAL EVENING. 

1405
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:53,664
I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY VERY 

1406
00:43:53,664 --> 00:44:03,107
MUCH. 

1407
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:05,175
NICK MULLVANEY WILL BE GIVING A 

1408
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:05,642

1409
00:44:05,642 --> 00:44:09,279
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR IT? 

1410
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:15,419
WE'LL SAY GRACE AFTERWARDS. 

1411
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:16,820
WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO DO 

1412
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,987
THAT IN FRONT OF THE CAMERAS. 

1413
00:44:17,987 --> 00:44:21,792
>> I'M GOING TO TRY HARD TO 

1414
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:22,826
MAKE THIS NOT BORING. 

1415
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,528
MR. PRESIDENT, A LOT OF FOLKS

ON THOSE WORDS TO SHOW PEOPLE 

1424
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:43,914

00:44:52,689 --> 00:44:56,492
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE 

1431
00:44:56,492 --> 00:44:57,427
GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION VERY 

1432
00:44:57,427 --> 00:44:57,694
BRIEFLY. 

1433
00:44:57,694 --> 00:44:59,662
WHEN WE GOT INTO THIS, ONE OF 

1434
00:44:59,662 --> 00:45:05,836
THE THINGS WE LEARNED WAS IT 

1435
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:07,805
HAS BEEN ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS 

1436
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:10,007
SINCE ANYBODY REORGANIZED THE 

1437
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:14,511
GOVERNMENT AT THIS TYPE OF 

1438
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:14,744
SCALE. 

1439
00:45:14,744 --> 00:45:15,745
IT HAS BEEN SINCE F.D.R. 

1440
00:45:15,745 --> 00:45:18,916
WE ARE ALMOST 20% INTO THE 21st 

1441
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:20,317
CENTURY BUT WE ARE STILL 

1442
00:45:20,317 --> 00:45:23,420
DEALING WITH A GOVERNMENT FROM 

1443
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:31,194
THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY. 

1444
00:45:31,194 --> 00:45:34,732
THIS LEADS, MR. PRESIDENT, TO 

1445
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:35,099
WEIRD RESULTS. 

1446
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,234
BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE REGULATE 

1447
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,870
IN THIS COUNTRY, IF YOU HAVE A 

1448
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:42,806
CHEESE PIZZA OR YOU MAKE A

THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF 

1451
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,548
AGRICULTURE. 

1452
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:53,216
IF YOU PUT A PEPPERONI ON IT IT 

1453
00:45:53,216 --> 00:45:55,184
IS GOVERNED BY THE U.S.D.A. 

1454
00:45:55,184 --> 00:45:57,220
IF YOU HAVE A CHICKEN IT IS 

1455
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,155
GOVERNED BY THE U.S.D.A. 

1456
00:45:59,155 --> 00:46:00,824
IF THE CHICKEN LAYS AN EGG IT 

1457
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:02,459
IS GOVERNED BY THE F.D.A. IF 

1458
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:05,695
YOU BREAK THE EGG AND MAKE AN

00:46:05,695 --> 00:46:11,267
OMELET THAT IS COVERED BY THE 

1460
00:46:11,267 --> 00:46:11,568
U.S.D.A. 

1461
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:13,569
A LOT DOG, THE HOTDOG MEAT IS 

1462
00:46:13,569 --> 00:46:14,805
GOVERNED BY ONE. 

1463
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:17,407
IF YOU PUT IT IN A BUN IT IS 

1464
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:18,074
GOVERNED BY ANOTHER. 

1465
00:46:18,074 --> 00:46:19,543
IF YOU HAVE A SALMON IN THE 

1466
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:24,815
OCEAN IT IS GOVERNORRED BY THE 

1467
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:25,549
ADOPT OF COMMERCE. 

1468
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:30,720
ONCE IT SWIMS UP THE LADDER IT 

1469
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:38,729
HAS TO GO THROUGH THE 

1470
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:40,063
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR. 

1471
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:43,100
>> THAT WAS VERY WELL SAID. 

1472
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,102
THAT WAS VERY GOOD. 

1473
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:46,769
>> A LONG TIME AGO WHEN I WAS 

1474
00:46:46,769 --> 00:46:49,406
15 I WORKED IN A FREEZER FOR A 

1475
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:51,541
GUY THAT MADE FROZEN PIZZAS. 

1476
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:53,744
PUT YOURSELF IN THAT GUY'S 

1477
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:54,011
BUSINESS. 

1478
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:56,046
ONE DAY HE IS MAKING CHEESE 

1479
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:57,714
PIZZAS. 

1480
00:46:57,714 --> 00:46:58,948
THAT AFTERNOON HE IS MAKING 

1481
00:46:58,948 --> 00:46:59,248
PEPPERONI. 

1482
00:46:59,248 --> 00:47:00,817
IT WAS A DIFFERENT AGENCY HE 

1483
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:01,718
HAS TO DEAL WITH. 

1484
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:02,452
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. 

1485
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:03,786
WE'LL TRY TO FIX IT. 

1486
00:47:03,786 --> 00:47:06,323
I WANT TO GO THROUGH A COUPLE 

1487
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:06,890
OF EXAMPLES TODAY. 

1488
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,825
I WANT TO GO OVER ONE OR TWO. 

1489
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:11,494
A COUPLE OF THEM THAT MADE THE 

1490
00:47:11,494 --> 00:47:15,065
PRESS -- WE TALKED ABOUT THIS 

1491
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:15,665
-- ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF 

1492
00:47:15,665 --> 00:47:18,935
EDUCATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF 

1493
00:47:18,935 --> 00:47:19,402
LABOR BEING MERGED. 

1494
00:47:19,402 --> 00:47:21,104
WE THINK THAT MAKES TREMENDOUS 

1495
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:21,337
SENSE. 

1496
00:47:21,337 --> 00:47:22,205
THEY ARE DOING THE SAME THING 

1497
00:47:22,205 --> 00:47:24,307
GETTING PEOPLE READY FOR THE 

1498
00:47:24,307 --> 00:47:25,942
WORK FORCE. 

1499
00:47:25,942 --> 00:47:28,612
SOMETIMES IT IS EDUCATION. 

1500
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:30,881
SOMETIMES IT IS VOCATIONAL 

1501
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:31,148
TRAINING. 

1502
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:32,582
THIS GOES BACK TO THE WORK 

1503
00:47:32,582 --> 00:47:34,017
IVANKA TRUMP DID EARLY ON ON 

1504
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,819
JOB TRAINING -- IN FACT WE 

1505
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:37,521
DON'T KNOW HOW MANY JOB 

1506
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,388
TRAINING PROGRAMS WE HAVE. 

1507
00:47:39,388 --> 00:47:40,990
SOME PEOPLE THINK 40. 

1508
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:41,891
SOME PEOPLE THINK 46. 

1509
00:47:41,891 --> 00:47:43,994
WE GET IT DOWN TO 16 AND PUT IT 

1510
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:45,762
ALL IN ONE PLACE. 

1511
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:47,397
IF YOU ARE NOT HAPPY OR THE 

1512
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:49,733
NEXT PRESIDENT IS NOT HAPPY 

1513
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:52,436
WITH THE WAY IT IS GOING, RIGHT 

1514
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:53,270
NOW 16 DIFFERENT PEOPLE AROUND 

1515
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,906
THIS TABLE HAVE WORK FORCE 

1516
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:57,240
TRAINING PROGRAMS IN THEIR 

1517
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,241
AGENCIES. 

1518
00:47:58,241 --> 00:47:59,910
IF SOMETHING IS GOING WRONG 

1519
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:05,682
YOU'LL COME TO ME. 

1520
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:07,416
I'M SAY THAT'S SCOTT PRUITTS 

1521
00:48:07,416 --> 00:48:09,119
FAULT OR BETTY'S FAULT. 

1522
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:09,652
NOBODY IS IN CHARGE. 

1523
00:48:09,652 --> 00:48:12,723
NOW WE ARE MAKING THEM 

1524
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:13,390
RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABLE. 

1525
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,125
TWO OF MY FAVORITES -- EXAMPLES 

1526
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:20,030
OF HOW WE THINK WE CAN IMPROVE 

1527
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:20,263
THINGS. 

1528
00:48:20,263 --> 00:48:20,730
EVERYBODY, DEMOCRATS, 

1529
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:21,364
REPUBLICANS, LOCAL GOVERNMENT, 

1530
00:48:21,364 --> 00:48:24,034
STATE GOVERNMENT, YOU, ME FROM 

1531
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:27,004
THE PRIVATE SECTOR HAVE HORROR 

1532
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:29,305
STORIES ABOUT THE US ARMY CORP 

1533
00:48:29,305 --> 00:48:29,639
OF ENGINEERS. 

1534
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:30,140
THEY PERFORM CRITICAL 

1535
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,308
FUNCTIONS, THERE IS NO DOUBT 

1536
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:31,741
ABOUT IT. 

1537
00:48:31,741 --> 00:48:33,944
OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST 

1538
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:35,946
CENTURY THEIR ROLE HAS 

1539
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:38,015
CONTINUED TO CREEP AND CREEP. 

1540
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:39,048
THE PROPOSAL TODAY MAKES 

1541
00:48:39,048 --> 00:48:42,619
IMPORTANT CHANGES TO THE ARMY 

1542
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:43,320
CORP OF ENGINEERS. 

1543
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,023
THERE ARE STILL THINGS THE ARMY 

1544
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:47,557
CORP DOES THAT IS DEFENSE. 

1545
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:50,126
THEY STAY THERE AND THEY 

1546
00:48:50,126 --> 00:48:50,360
SHOULD. 

1547
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,562
THE THINGS THE ARMY CORP DOES 

1548
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:53,597
THAT HELPS DEFEND THE NATION 

1549
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,099
WILL STAY AT THE DEPARTMENT OF 

1550
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:56,733
DEFENSE. 

1551
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:59,369
THEY DEAL WITH THE ENVIRONMENT. 

1552
00:48:59,369 --> 00:48:59,970
THEY DEAL WITH ENVIRONMENTAL 

1553
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:00,270
MITIGATION. 

1554
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,638
THAT GOES OVER TO THE 

1555
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:03,573
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR. 

1556
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:07,510
Y'ALL ARE REALLY GOOD AT THAT. 

1557
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:07,977
SIMILARLY PORTS. 

1558
00:49:07,977 --> 00:49:11,748
IT USED TO BE A MILITARY THING 

1559
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:12,616
A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. 

1560
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:13,984
NOW IT IS A TRANSPORTATION 

1561
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:14,718
ITEM. 

1562
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:19,122
WE THINK IT IS A MUCH MORE 

1563
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:19,522
EFFICIENT LAYOUT. 

1564
00:49:19,522 --> 00:49:22,225
IT TIES INTO STREAMLINE 

1565
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:22,825
PERMITTING PROCESS AND GOING 

1566
00:49:22,825 --> 00:49:24,828
ALONG WITH WHAT IS BEING DONE 

1567
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:25,228
AT THE DOI. 

1568
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:29,599
YOU WANT TO GET A PERMIT, YOU 

1569
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,367
GO TO ONE FEDERAL AGENCY. 

1570
00:49:31,367 --> 00:49:32,569
THIS WILL HELP THAT. 

1571
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:37,908
DOWN HERE WE TALKED ABOUT ONE 

1572
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:38,474
FOOD SAFETY THING. 

1573
00:49:38,474 --> 00:49:41,645
IT IS F.D.A. AND U.S.D.A. 

1574
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:44,380
-- WE MOVE THAT TO THE U.S.D.A. 

1575
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:44,581
WHY? 

1576
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:46,682
THEY ARE REALLY GOOD AT IT. 

1577
00:49:46,682 --> 00:49:48,118
WOULDN'T IT BE NICE FOR PEOPLE 

1578
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:51,521
TO GO TO ONE PLACE TO GET 

1579
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:53,657
ANSWERS AND PERMITS AND DEAL 

1580
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,224
WITH REGULATORY AFFAIRS. 

1581
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:54,791
THERE ARE THINGS U.S.D.A. 

1582
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:58,328
DOESN'T DO AS WELL AS OTHER 

1583
00:49:58,328 --> 00:49:59,563
AGENCIES. 

1584
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:01,764
THEY HAVE A BIG HOUSING 

1585
00:50:01,764 --> 00:50:02,064
COMPONENT. 

1586
00:50:02,064 --> 00:50:05,535
WHY WOULDN'T THAT BE BETTER OFF 

1587
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:06,670
AT HOUSING AND URBAN 

1588
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,003
DEVELOPMENT. 

1589
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:10,206
WE PROPOSED TO MOVE THAT TO 

1590
00:50:10,206 --> 00:50:10,407
HUD. 

1591
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:14,277
FOR YEARS THEY HANDLED THE FOOD 

1592
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:15,678
STAMP AND SNAP PROGRAM. 

1593
00:50:15,678 --> 00:50:16,145
THAT MAKES NO SENSE. 

1594
00:50:16,145 --> 00:50:22,352
WE MOVE HAD THE OVER INTO HHS 

1595
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,520
AND TO HAVE IT CENTRALIZED SO 

1596
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,421
WE CAN DEAL WITH IT. 

1597
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:30,227
NO ONE HAS EVER TRIED IT AT 

1598
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:31,728
THAT SCALE, MR. PRESIDENT. 

1599
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:32,562
PRESIDENT CLINTON TRIED IT A 

1600
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:32,896
LITTLE BIT. 

1601
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:35,432
NO ONE HAS EVER DONE IT AT THAT 

1602
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:37,000
SCALE AND IMPORTANTLY NO ONE 

1603
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,669
HAS EVER FOLLOWED THROUGH ON 

1604
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:39,869
IT. 

1605
00:50:39,869 --> 00:50:44,274
NO ONE HAS BEEN GIVEN A TIME 

1606
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:44,741
COMMITMENT. 

1607
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:47,110
NO ONE HAS REALLY EVER COME UP 

1608
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:50,380
WITH THE BIG STUFF LIKE THIS. 

1609
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,047
EVERY TIME SOMEONES SAYS THAT'S 

1610
00:50:51,047 --> 00:50:52,715
OKAY THIS IS NEVER GOING TO 

1611
00:50:52,715 --> 00:50:52,949
HAPPEN. 

1612
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:55,518
THIS IS GREAT IDEAS BUT IT 

1613
00:50:55,518 --> 00:50:56,886
DOESN'T HAVE A CHANCE. 

1614
00:50:56,886 --> 00:51:02,826
ONE OF THE BIGGEST IDEAS THE 

1615
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:03,393
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND 

1616
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,127
LABOR MERGER DOESN'T GET 

1617
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:06,930
INVOLVED IN BATTLE ON THE HILL. 

1618
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:08,131
CONGRESS IS AHEAD OF US ON 

1619
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:09,399
THIS, WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO 

1620
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:09,599
SAY. 

1621
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,534
THERE IS A CHANCE WE CAN GET 

1622
00:51:11,534 --> 00:51:11,834
THAT DONE. 

1623
00:51:11,834 --> 00:51:14,137
EVEN IF WE DON'T GET IT DONE 

1624
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:15,371
NOW, THIS IS THE GENERATIONAL 

1625
00:51:15,371 --> 00:51:17,106
STUFF THAT I THINK YOU ASKED US 

1626
00:51:17,106 --> 00:51:21,177
TO DO WHEN YOU CAME TO OFFICE. 

1627
00:51:21,177 --> 00:51:21,778
WHEN RONALD REAGAN SAID 

1628
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:23,112
GOVERNMENT WASN'T THE SOLUTION 

1629
00:51:23,112 --> 00:51:23,713
IT WAS THE PROBLEM. 

1630
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:25,114
IT TOOK 15 YEARS AFTER THAT FOR 

1631
00:51:25,114 --> 00:51:27,250
BILL CLINTON TO GO ON TV AND 

1632
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,352
SAY THE AGE OF BIG GOVERNMENT 

1633
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:29,719
IS DEAD. 

1634
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:32,955
THIS IS A GENERATIONAL THING. 

1635
00:51:32,955 --> 00:51:34,825
WILL IT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT? 

1636
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:34,991
NO. 

1637
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:35,258
SOME CAN. 

1638
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,793
SOME WE CAN DO THROUGH THE 

1639
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:38,028
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS. 

1640
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:39,262
OTHER STUFF WILL TAKE LONGER. 

1641
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:41,697
THIS IS STUFF WORTH FIGHTING 

1642
00:51:41,697 --> 00:51:41,898
FOR. 

1643
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:43,266
IT WON'T GET DONE UNLESS 

1644
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,035
SOMEBODY TAKES THE FIRST STEPS, 

1645
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:45,968
WHICH IS WHAT WE ARE DOING 

1646
00:51:45,968 --> 00:51:46,303
TODAY. 

1647
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,437
THANK YOU FOR NOT ONLY GIVING 

1648
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,505
US THE TIME TO DO THIS BUT THE 

1649
00:51:49,505 --> 00:51:50,840
ENCOURAGE TO DO THIS. 

1650
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,908
IT REALLY HELPED TO GO BACK AND 

1651
00:51:52,908 --> 00:51:53,376
SAY PUSH HARDER. 

1652
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:54,910
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO THE 

1653
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:55,211
PRESIDENT. 

1654
00:51:55,211 --> 00:51:57,047
THIS IS WHAT HE TALKED ABOUT 

1655
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:58,080
WHEN HE SAID DRAIN THE SWAMP. 

1656
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,317
THIS IS WHERE WE CAN SHOW 

1657
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:01,952
PEOPLE THAT VOTED FOR YOU AND 

1658
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,320
EVEN THE PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T 

1659
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,055
VOTE FOR YOU THAT YOU CARE 

1660
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:05,622
ABOUT GOOD GOVERNMENT. 

1661
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:06,923
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THINGS A 

1662
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:07,457
LOT BETTER. 

1663
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:10,327
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

1664
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:13,430
I THINK THAT WAS TERRIFIC. 

1665
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:14,631
I WANT YOU TO WRITE DOWN THAT 

1666
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:14,998
ONE ANECDOTE. 

1667
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:18,067
I THINK THEY SHOULD GIVE IT A 

1668
00:52:18,067 --> 00:52:18,367
BIG REPORT. 

1669
00:52:18,367 --> 00:52:21,838
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK SECRETARY 

1670
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:26,443

1671
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:29,112
INCREDIBLE, MIKE POMPEO TO JUMP

DATE US ON NORTH KOREA. 

1673
00:52:29,979 --> 00:52:34,116
>> SINCE JUNE 12TH, A WEEK AND 

1674
00:52:34,116 --> 00:52:36,653
A DAY, WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT 

1675
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:37,053
PROGRESS. 

1676
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:39,923
NOT ONLY ARE OUR ALLIES MOST 

1677
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,558
DIRECTLY AFFECTED, SOUTH KOREA, 

1678
00:52:41,558 --> 00:52:44,628
JAPANESE AND CHINESE BUT A 

1679
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:44,995
BROADER CIRCLE. 

1680
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,396
I HAVE TALKED WITH THE BRITS 

1681
00:52:47,396 --> 00:52:48,732
AND AUSTRALIANS AND OTHER 

1682
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:49,032
EUROPEANS. 

1683
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:49,599
EACH UNDERSTANDS WE HAVE 

1684
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:50,734
FUNDAMENTALLY SET A COURSE THAT 

1685
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:55,171
HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE 

1686
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:55,538
HUMANITY. 

1687
00:52:55,538 --> 00:52:59,608
THEY ARE ALL ON BOARD AND 

1688
00:52:59,608 --> 00:53:00,443
SUPPORTIVE OF CONTINUING 

1689
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:03,546
SANCTIONS UNTIL WE ARE 

1690
00:53:03,546 --> 00:53:03,813
COMPLETE. 

1691
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:04,714
WE HAVE A UNIFIED WORLD TO JOIN 

1692
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:05,048
CHAIRMAN KIM. 

1693
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:08,618
I WAS THERE WHEN HE SAID IT. 

1694
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:10,353
HE MADE A PERSONAL COMMITMENT. 

1695
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:12,322
HE SAID WE'LL CREATE A BRIGHTER 

1696
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:16,992
FUTURE FOR NORTH KOREA AND 

1697
00:53:16,992 --> 00:53:18,561
DENUCLEARIZE AS QUICKLY AS WE 

1698
00:53:18,561 --> 00:53:20,130
CAN ACHIEVE THAT. 

1699
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:20,530
I'M WORKING HARD. 

1700
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,531
I'M SURE THERE WILL BE BUMPS 

1701
00:53:22,531 --> 00:53:22,898
ALONG THE WAY. 

1702
00:53:22,898 --> 00:53:25,168
I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN GET 

1703
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:28,505
THE WORLD TO UNITE BEHIND THIS 

1704
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:29,405
IMPORTANT MISSION. 

1705
00:53:29,405 --> 00:53:31,541
>> YOU DID A HELL OF A JOB. 

1706
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:34,244
HE'S BEEN IN A LOT OF -- HE'S 

1707
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:39,815
LOGGED A LOT OF HOURS IN 

1708
00:53:39,815 --> 00:53:40,350
AIRPLANES GOING OVER. 

1709
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:44,754
IT IS A 23 HOUR FLIGHT. 

1710
00:53:44,754 --> 00:53:48,258
WE ARE VERY PROUD OF YOU. 

1711
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:51,227
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. 

1712
00:53:51,227 --> 00:53:51,494
APPRECIATE IT. 

1713
00:54:08,978 --> 00:54:10,146
THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS MY 

1714
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:14,517
MESSAGE TO LAWMAKERS HAVING TO 

1715
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:15,251
DO WITH IMMIGRATION? 

1716
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:17,053
THEY HAVE TO GET TOGETHER AND 

1717
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:17,721
DO SOMETHING. 

1718
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:20,423
THEY HAVE TO SIT DOWN. 

1719
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:23,426
I'M INVITE SENATOR SCHUMER AND 

1720
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:23,759
NANCY PELOSI. 

1721
00:54:23,759 --> 00:54:25,128
THEY CAN COME OVER AND BRING 

1722
00:54:25,128 --> 00:54:25,929
WHOEVER THEY WANT. 

1723
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:29,698
THE LAWMAKERS HAVE TO SIT DOWN 

1724
00:54:29,698 --> 00:54:30,333
AND DO SOMETHING. 

1725
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:32,001
OUR COUNTRY CAN NOT CONTINUE TO 

1726
00:54:32,001 --> 00:54:33,169
RUN LIKE THIS. 

1727
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:35,438
WE CAN NOT HAVE OPEN BORDERS. 

1728
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:37,139
YOU HAVE TO HAVE BORDERS. 

1729
00:54:37,139 --> 00:54:39,542
YOU DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY 

1730
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:40,243
WITHOUT BORDERS. 

1731
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:40,910
THEY HAVE TO BE ENFORCED. 

1732
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:43,379
WE WANT PEOPLE TO COME INTO OUR 

1733
00:54:43,379 --> 00:54:43,713
COUNTRY. 

1734
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:44,848
WE NEED THEM. 

1735
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:45,648
WE HAVE MANY COMPANIES RIGHT 

1736
00:54:45,648 --> 00:54:51,454
NOW MOVING BACK INTO THE UNITED 

1737
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:51,687
STATES. 

1738
00:54:51,687 --> 00:54:55,458
THEY NEED WORKERS. 

1739
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,027
WE HAVE 3 .8% UNEMPLOYMENT. 

1740
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:58,128
I WANT PEOPLE TO COME IN. 

1741
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,497
THEY HAVE TO COME IN THROUGH A 

1742
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:00,830
MERIT SYSTEM. 

1743
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:05,635
WE CAN HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE 

1744
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:10,173
COME TO THE COUNTRY THROUGH A 

1745
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:10,940
MERIT SYSTEM. 

1746
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,543
IN A VERY, VERY SIMPLE WAY, 

1747
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:15,311
CONGRESS HAS TO GET TOGETHER, 

1748
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:17,413
GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER, 

1749
00:55:17,413 --> 00:55:18,548
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS, THEY 

1750
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:20,850
HAVE TO COME UP WITH A 

1751
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:21,851
SOLUTION. 

1752
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:22,385
I HAVE IDEAS. 

1753
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:22,819
THEY HAVE IDEAS. 

1754
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:28,224
WE CAN PUT THEM TOGETHER 

1755
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:28,457
EASILY. 

1756
00:55:28,457 --> 00:55:31,328
THERE IS SO MUCH HATRED -- I 

1757
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,662
MEAN -- I'M NOT SAYING THIS 

1758
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:35,565
BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF FALSE 

1759
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:36,332
REPORTING AND MISREPORTING -- 

1760
00:55:36,332 --> 00:55:38,835
THERE IS ALSO A LOT OF GREAT 

1761
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:39,869
REPORTING, BUT CONGRESS HAS TO 

1762
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:40,236
COME TOGETHER. 

1763
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:42,339
THIS IS BEST TIME TO DO IT. 

1764
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,873
RIGHT NOW IS THE BEST TIME I 

1765
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:48,478
HAVE SEEN FOR PEOPLE THAT 

1766
00:55:48,478 --> 00:55:50,713
REALLY ARE WELL-MEANING. 

1767
00:55:50,713 --> 00:55:58,020
UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE AN 

1768
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:07,831
ELECTION COMING UP OF. 

1769
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:11,434
WE ARE WILLING LAUGHED AT AS A 

1770
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:17,740
COUNTRY BECAUSE OF OUR BAD 

1771
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:25,048
IMMIGRATION POLICIES. 

1772
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:28,017
LAWS HAVE BEEN SO COMPLEX AND 

1773
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:28,318
RIDICULOUS. 

1774
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:31,421
WE REALLY DON'T HAVE A LAW. 

1775
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:33,223
WE HAVE LAWS THAT ALLOW TO DO 

1776
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,123
WHAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE 

1777
00:56:34,123 --> 00:56:34,357
DOING. 

1778
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:36,426
WE WANT TO KEEP IT IN A HUMAN 

1779
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:36,626
WAY. 

1780
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:41,631
WE WANT TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE. 

1781
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:44,767
IF WE DON'T TAKE THEM IN WE 

1782
00:56:44,767 --> 00:56:46,903
NEED TO HELP. 

1783
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:55,412
WE NEED HELP FROM MEXICO. 

1784
00:57:00,149 --> 00:57:02,017
WE WANT TO PUT THEM TOGETHER. 

1785
00:57:02,017 --> 00:57:03,820
WE DON'T WANT CHILDREN 

1786
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:04,454
SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS. 

1787
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:07,323
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND YOU GAVE 

1788
00:57:07,323 --> 00:57:09,558
AN EXAMPLE YESTERDAY OF 12,000 

1789
00:57:09,558 --> 00:57:09,825
CHILDREN. 

1790
00:57:09,825 --> 00:57:13,730
OF THE 12,000, 10,000 CAME UP 

1791
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:17,232
EITHER ALONE, THEY WERE NOT 

1792
00:57:17,232 --> 00:57:19,035
NECESSARILY YOUNG CHILDREN OR 

1793
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:21,738
THEY CAME UP WITH TRAFFICKERS 

1794
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:22,304
AND COYOTES. 

1795
00:57:22,304 --> 00:57:23,573
THESE COYOTES ARE BAD DUDES. 

1796
00:57:23,573 --> 00:57:28,444
BUT THEY CAME UP WITH OTHER 

1797
00:57:28,444 --> 00:57:29,445
PEOPLE. 

1798
00:57:29,445 --> 00:57:30,512
THEY ARE USING THESE CHILDREN. 

1799
00:57:30,512 --> 00:57:32,849
THAT'S 10,000 OUT OF THE 

1800
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:33,249
12,000. 

1801
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:34,617
OF THE 2,000, A LOT OF THE 

1802
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,953
PEOPLE -- WHEN THEY CAME IN 

1803
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,121
WITH THEIR CHILDREN, THIS IS 

1804
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:40,356
THEIR FIFTH TIME TRYING TO COME 

1805
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:40,889
INTO OUR COUNTRY. 

1806
00:57:40,889 --> 00:57:43,459
THIS IS NOT A PERFECT 

1807
00:57:43,459 --> 00:57:43,759
SITUATION. 

1808
00:57:43,759 --> 00:57:44,460
THIS IS VERY BAD. 

1809
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,529
PORT OF ENTRY, IF YOU GO TO A 

1810
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:48,731
PORT OF ENTRY IT WORKS OUT 

1811
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:48,964
NICELY. 

1812
00:57:48,964 --> 00:57:50,433
THEY HAVE BEEN DOING A GOOD 

1813
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:50,633
JOB. 

1814
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:51,800
THEY DON'T WANT DO COME IN 

1815
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,402
THROUGH THE PORT OF ENTRY. 

1816
00:57:53,402 --> 00:57:54,903
THAT'S CALLED DOING IT THE 

1817
00:57:54,903 --> 00:57:55,672
LEGAL WAY. 

1818
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:57,740
MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN THE 2,000 

1819
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:59,442
CATEGORY, YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT 

1820
00:57:59,442 --> 00:58:00,743
2,000 CHILDREN, THOSE ARE 

1821
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:03,346
PEOPLE THAT TRIED TO COME INTO 

1822
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:04,147
OUR COUNTRY MANY TIMES THE SAME 

1823
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:04,347
WAY. 

1824
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:06,715
THEY DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE 

1825
00:58:06,715 --> 00:58:07,383
PORT OF ENTRY. 

1826
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:09,618
USUALLY THAT'S FOR A VERY BAD 

1827
00:58:09,618 --> 00:58:09,852
REASON. 

1828
00:58:09,852 --> 00:58:11,920
WHY DON'T THEY WANT TO GO IN 

1829
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:12,187
LEGALLY? 

1830
00:58:12,187 --> 00:58:14,657
YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF THAT 

1831
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:14,923
QUESTION. 

1832
00:58:14,923 --> 00:58:17,627
SO YOU HAVE A SITUATION THAT IS 

1833
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:19,128
RIGHT FOR CONGRESS TO GET 

1834
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:22,431
TOGETHER AND COME UP WITH A 

1835
00:58:22,431 --> 00:58:22,698
SOLUTION. 

1836
00:58:22,698 --> 00:58:25,134
AND I AM READY, WILLING AND 

1837
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:28,404
ABLE TO HELP AND READY, WILLING 

1838
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:33,643
AND ABLE TO TAKE THIS PEN RIGHT 

1839
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:34,309
HERE AND SIGN VERY QUICKLY. 

1840
00:58:34,309 --> 00:58:37,547
>> DOES ZERO TOLERANCE STILL 

1841
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:37,747
EXIT? 

1842
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:40,015
>> IF WE TOOK ZERO TOLERANCE 

1843
00:58:40,015 --> 00:58:41,618
AWAY YOU WOULD BE OVERRUN -- 

1844
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:44,754
YOU WOULD HAVE MILLIONS OF 

1845
00:58:44,754 --> 00:58:45,521
PEOPLE POURING THROUGH OUR 

1846
00:58:45,521 --> 00:58:45,754
BORDER. 

1847
00:58:45,754 --> 00:58:48,457
IF YOU TOOK ZERO TOLERANCE AWAY 

1848
00:58:48,457 --> 00:58:49,125
EVERYBODY WOULD COME. 

1849
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:52,561
RIGHT NOW THEY WOULD BE GETTING 

1850
00:58:52,561 --> 00:58:55,365
THEIR LITTLE BELONGINGS AND 

1851
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,031
THEY WOULD BE HEADING UP. 

1852
00:58:56,031 --> 00:58:58,468
YOU WOULD HAVE A RUN ON THIS 

1853
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:00,837
COUNTRY, THE LIKES OF WHICH 

1854
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:02,238
NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN. 

1855
00:59:02,238 --> 00:59:04,606
WE HAVE TO HAVE STRONG BORDERS. 

1856
00:59:04,606 --> 00:59:07,243
FRANKLY, THE WALL, IN TERMS OF 

1857
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:08,778
DRUGS AND IN TERMS OF KEEPING 

1858
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:10,446
CERTAIN PEOPLE OUT THAT WE 

1859
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:12,781
DON'T WANT IN THIS COUNTRY, THE 

1860
00:59:12,781 --> 00:59:13,248
WALL IS IMPERATIVE. 

1861
00:59:13,248 --> 00:59:15,651
WE HAVE TO HAVE THE WALL. 

1862
00:59:15,651 --> 00:59:17,620
WE STARTED THE WALL. 

1863
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,688
WE HAVE $1 .6 BILLION. 

1864
00:59:19,688 --> 00:59:20,990
WE ARE FIXS TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS 

1865
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:23,459
OF WALL WHERE IT HAS BEEN 

1866
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:23,726
OVERRUN. 

1867
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:26,996
WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A 

1868
00:59:26,996 --> 00:59:27,263
SOLUTION. 

1869
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:27,897
I WOULD CONSIDER IT WHETHER IT 

1870
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:30,433
IS NORTH KOREA, WHETHER IT IS 

1871
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:33,469
SO MANY OTHER THINGS, WE HAVE A 

1872
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:33,836
LOT OF THINGS. 

1873
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:35,171
LOOK, I HAVE BEEN GIVEN A VERY 

1874
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:35,805
TOUGH HAND. 

1875
00:59:35,805 --> 00:59:38,942
BECAUSE I CAME UP HERE AND WE 

1876
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:40,243
HAD AN ECONOMY GOING DOWN. 

1877
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:43,579
WE HAD AN IRAN PROBLEM. 

1878
00:59:43,579 --> 00:59:44,713
WE HAD A MIDDLE EAST PROBLEM. 

1879
00:59:44,713 --> 00:59:51,287
TAKE A LOOK AT  LOOK AT WHAT 

1880
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:52,255
WAS GOING ON IN THE MIDDLE 

1881
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:52,755
EAST. 

1882
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:53,256
IT IS BETTER NOW. 

1883
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:56,425
WE WERE GIVEN A LOT OF BAD 

1884
00:59:56,425 --> 00:59:56,658
CARDS. 

1885
00:59:56,658 --> 00:59:59,128
ONE OF THE BAD CARDS WAS THIS 

1886
00:59:59,128 --> 00:59:59,528
IMMIGRATION MESS. 

1887
00:59:59,528 --> 01:00:04,133
IT WAS MADE WORSE BY ALL OF THE 

1888
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:06,302
DIFFERENT CONTRADICTING LAWS 

1889
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:06,902
THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED. 

1890
01:00:06,902 --> 01:00:09,605
WE ARE GOING TO WORK VERY HARD 

1891
01:00:09,605 --> 01:00:11,274
WITH MIKE PENCE AND EVERYBODY 

1892
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:11,741
IN THIS ROOM. 

1893
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:14,644
WE'LL WORK HARD TO SEE IF WE 

1894
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:15,177
CAN SOLVE THE IMMIGRATION 

1895
01:00:15,177 --> 01:00:15,444
PROBLEM. 

1896
01:00:15,444 --> 01:00:17,046
WE NEED DEMOCRATS TO BE ABLE TO 

1897
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:17,279
DO IT. 

1898
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:20,515
IF THEY ARE GOING TO OBSTRUCT, 

1899
01:00:20,515 --> 01:00:21,651
IT CAN'T BE DONE. 

1900
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:23,318
THE REPUBLICANS DON'T HAVE THE 

1901
01:00:23,318 --> 01:00:23,552
VOTES. 

1902
01:00:23,552 --> 01:00:25,054
I THINK WE'LL WIN ADDITIONAL 

1903
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:26,088
SENATE SEATS. 

1904
01:00:26,088 --> 01:00:28,925
THAT WILL HELP US A LOT. 

1905
01:00:28,925 --> 01:00:29,691
UNLESS WE GET ADDITIONAL SENATE 

1906
01:00:29,691 --> 01:00:31,126
SEATS AND UNLESS WE KEEP THE 

1907
01:00:31,126 --> 01:00:33,028
HOUSE MORE OR LESS LIKE IT IS 

1908
01:00:33,028 --> 01:00:34,831
RIGHT NOW, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO 

1909
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:37,133
BE -- UNLESS THE DEMOCRATS ARE 

1910
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,568
SERIOUS AND THEY WANT TO COME 

1911
01:00:38,568 --> 01:00:41,037
ALONG AND THEY WANT TO GET 

1912
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:41,604
IMMIGRATION WORK DONE. 

1913
01:00:41,604 --> 01:00:45,741
WE CAN DO SOMETHING THAT IS 

1914
01:00:45,741 --> 01:00:48,110
GOING TO BE HISTORIC. 

1915
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:49,545
WE CAN DO SOMETHING THAT WILL 

1916
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:50,146
BE HISTORIC. 

1917
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,347
WE CAN GET IT DONE. 

1918
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:52,581
I AM READY. 

1919
01:00:52,581 --> 01:00:53,049
I AM HERE. 

1920
01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:54,951
ALL OF THESE PEOPLE -- THESE 

1921
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:55,418
ARE TALENTED PEOPLE. 

1922
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:57,719
WE ARE ALL READY AND WE ARE ALL 

1923
01:00:57,719 --> 01:00:58,054
HERE. 

1924
01:00:58,054 --> 01:00:59,622
WE NEED VOTES FROM THE 

1925
01:00:59,622 --> 01:01:00,456
DEMOCRATS OR NOTHING CAN PASS. 

1926
01:01:00,456 --> 01:01:00,990
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. 

1927
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:11,133
YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 

1928
01:01:11,133 --> 01:01:14,370

1929
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:15,404
MEETING WITH HIS CABINET. 

1930
01:01:15,404 --> 01:01:16,972
HE DISCUSSED IMMIGRATION AFTER 

1931
01:01:16,972 --> 01:01:18,674
REVERSING HIS POLICY ON FAMILY 

1932
01:01:18,674 --> 01:01:19,241
SEPARATIONS AT THE BORDER. 

1933
01:01:19,241 --> 01:01:19,775
I'M REENA NINAN. 

1934
01:01:19,775 --> 01:01:21,744
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. 

1935
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:25,782
WE ARE WATCHING THE HOUSE OF

01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:26,182
REPRESENTATIVES. 

1937
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:27,516
LAWMAKERS WILL TAKE UP TWO 

1938
01:01:27,516 --> 01:01:28,851
SWEEPING BILLS TODAY TO 

1939
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:30,052
OVERHAUL THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM 

1940
01:01:30,052 --> 01:01:32,889
AFTER ESCALATING PRESSURE IN 

1941
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:34,257
RECENT DAYS TO ACT. 

1942
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:37,760
THE FIRST VOTE ON HARD-LINE 

1943
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:38,393
LEGISLATION IS REALLY EXPECTED 

1944
01:01:38,393 --> 01:01:38,761
ANY MOMEN NOW. 

1945
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:40,463
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WILL VOTE 

1946
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:42,531
ON THE COMPROMISE BILL. 

1947
01:01:42,531 --> 01:01:47,036
IT IS BACKED BY THE PRESIDENT. 

1948
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:50,439
THE MEASURE WILL GO TO THE 

1949
01:01:50,439 --> 01:01:51,006
HOUSE FLOOR LATER ON AFTER 

1950
01:01:51,006 --> 01:01:53,643

1952
01:01:54,243 --> 00:00:00,000
POLICY OF
