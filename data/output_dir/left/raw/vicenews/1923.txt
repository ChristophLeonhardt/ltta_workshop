00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,350
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost wanted to call this piece</font>

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,179
everything is terrible because I just

3
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:05,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">walked away being like god damn it this</font>

4
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:06,839
is this drought isn't saying and it's

5
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,220
projected that these are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

6
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:21,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">more frequent and more intense hey I'm</font>

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,160
Neelu<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tabrizi I'm a journalist here at</font>

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,750
vice news we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to chat about my</font>

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,250
piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the drought it's called race to</font>

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,900
the bottom so Michael<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you have any</font>

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,369
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I even better than me</font>

13
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:33,660
asking questions I've got some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people on</font>

14
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,770
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet who we're gonna ask you</font>

15
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,899
questions call so let's I hate to Eileen

16
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,270
who's calling<font color="#CCCCCC"> us on skype from Iowa</font>

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,340
balls yes great please<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay hey Eileen</font>

20
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty good pretty good how can i solve</font>

21
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,890
all of your drought problems haha well

22
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,930
we're actually getting some rain down

23
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,010
here at Iowa but um we obviously hear

24
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,039
about the array of problems um better

25
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,939
causing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Californians droughts um and I</font>

26
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,280
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask in your opinion why is</font>

27
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,530
the why is the general public hearing

28
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,290
about this now um and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of when it's</font>

29
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,110
to the point where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's unsustainable to</font>

30
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,270
come back from yeah that's a very good

31
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,909
question i<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean i think what i think is</font>

32
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:23,250
probably the answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that people don't</font>

33
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">really care unless</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's happening to</font>

34
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,700
them it's really really hard to care

35
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,020
about something that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on in a</font>

36
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,610
state even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though it's a state that</font>

37
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,650
maybe provides a ton of the food for the

38
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">rest of the country it's really hard to</font>

39
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:34,950
start carrying until it gets to that

40
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,750
breaking point so that's probably why

41
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,880
we're hearing a lot about it now and

42
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heard a lot about it in the past</font>

43
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,180
six<font color="#CCCCCC"> months really really ramped up um</font>

44
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,579
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like what do you think are the</font>

45
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:52,170
top three reasons why why the drought<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

46
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,810
happening yeah yeah i mean the biggest

47
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,939
one is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> lack of rainfall right so</font>

48
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:00,270
the the main sources of of water for

49
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,969
California are snow packs and water from

50
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:04,259
rivers lakes and streams so if you're

51
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:05,939
not getting that snow you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not getting</font>

52
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,128
that rainfall there's little to no water

53
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,750
that people are getting from surface

54
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,209
water sources and so that leaves farmers

55
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:13,350
figuring out what

56
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,310
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do because there are</font>

57
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,740
the people that use or the industry<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

58
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,990
uses the most water in the state because

59
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,970
you need a lot of water to grow food so

60
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,890
you're kind of stuck<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the situation</font>

61
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,300
where you have to make do with what you

62
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,890
can or use an alternate source of water

63
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,820
thank you that gives a really good

64
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,950
overview for people out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of state kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

65
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,160
tuning in um so in regards to lose it or

66
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,020
use a policy that you said in your video

67
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,230
um would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think it's pop plausible at</font>

68
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,720
this time to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a program to donate</font>

69
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,450
the unused water back to the public yeah

70
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,820
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything that is that has to do</font>

71
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,740
with changing the water right system in

72
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,660
California is just really<font color="#CCCCCC"> really tough</font>

73
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,910
to do these rules<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been set over a</font>

74
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,680
hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's a very</font>

75
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,890
very strong agricultural lobby in the

76
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,630
state there's a lot of interest to keep

77
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,880
the system the way it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though it</font>

78
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,530
might not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the best fit for the</font>

79
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,270
drought so yes I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's a way</font>

80
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can change it but there's got to</font>

81
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,630
be a political<font color="#E5E5E5"> will there's the people</font>

82
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,670
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have to sacrifice having it</font>

83
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,010
good for so many years to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

84
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,990
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough water for the future so the</font>

85
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,460
change is going to be really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard</font>

86
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,470
I mean California passed its first

87
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:23,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">groundwater law a year ago so that's you</font>

88
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">know taking water from beneath</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

89
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,490
surface beneath the earth's surface and

90
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,340
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> law it was met with a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of you</font>

91
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">know a lot of tension people from both</font>

92
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,970
politicians from both sides<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the aisle</font>

93
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,890
really didn't want a groundwater law to

94
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,380
be passed at all and so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was finally</font>

95
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,270
passed but it's some people say it's

96
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,130
kind of toothless because it doesn't

97
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,860
really regulate ground water until 2040

98
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,380
so you can see how how tough it was just

99
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,900
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change that one part of water use in</font>

100
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,490
California when it comes to agriculture

101
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,260
so we can change it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to</font>

102
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,750
be really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> tough do you think</font>

103
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,120
there'll be um do you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can be</font>

104
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a collaboration of the public and</font>

105
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">the agriculture agriculture groups or</font>

106
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,560
will it be more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a fight more of a</font>

107
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,070
collide on getting maybe like a donation

108
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,800
of the water getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to finally um</font>

109
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,650
not use so much water I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's</font>

110
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,150
it's always going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be tense I mean</font>

111
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,910
water wars in California I mean people

112
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,470
have been fighting<font color="#CCCCCC"> for water since</font>

113
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,238
people have come to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the state so I think</font>

114
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:22,650
it's always going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a tense battle</font>

115
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,419
because this is a resource<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we need</font>

116
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,800
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything and so</font>

117
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,180
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're there</font>

118
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,830
definitely needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be cooperation but</font>

119
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,400
is it going to be easy probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> not all</font>

120
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,039
right um so something from Iowa I just

121
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:39,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to ask um how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can other states help</font>

122
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,009
California in its situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you think</font>

123
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:44,259
they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> um and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also maybe how can they</font>

124
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:45,909
take from this hardship can they use it

125
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:47,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example can they really learn from it</font>

126
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,860
um is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of are we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

127
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,110
experienced these problems yeah i think

128
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,449
the an interesting take away we can look

129
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:58,319
at with<font color="#E5E5E5"> california is to maybe take away</font>

130
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:00,490
some lessons of some of the mistakes

131
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,050
that the state has made and is now

132
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,969
trying to rectify<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean all the</font>

133
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:05,620
problems with water in<font color="#CCCCCC"> california</font>

134
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,750
existed before the drought and during

135
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,310
the drought is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of like taking</font>

136
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sheet off of it and put it really</font>

137
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:12,909
just right center in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the in the in the</font>

138
00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:14,560
public eye so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest thing</font>

139
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,389
that we can take<font color="#CCCCCC"> from California is that</font>

140
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:19,000
groundwater management needs to happen

141
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,400
immediately and it can't just be let's

142
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">just have a law that in 2040 by that</font>

143
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,210
time that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to start</font>

144
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,310
monitoring how much water we're taking

145
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,599
from the ground and restricting it

146
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:29,560
that's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to do right</font>

147
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,840
away and we can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because</font>

148
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,569
California is you know has among the

149
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:36,039
highest rate of groundwater depletion in

150
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:37,930
the world that arguably it's been

151
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,370
happening because there's little to no

152
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,289
regulations so let's learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> from that for</font>

153
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:42,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">other states that might have to go down</font>

family were pistachio growers I'm near

171
00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:26,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">the central valley kind of near</font>

172
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,469
Bakersfield so the drought has affected

173
00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:34,300
our family business<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's been in our</font>

174
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,630
family for just under 30<font color="#CCCCCC"> years pistachio</font>

175
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,350
trees last you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> very long</font>

176
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,530
I'm so it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for a while</font>

177
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,150
definitely through this drought just

178
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,940
gotta power through it and from my

179
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,580
experience you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the field I have</font>

180
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,460
a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions after you visited some</font>

181
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:58,220
fields do you think that there are truly

182
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,770
some crops that use a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot more you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

183
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,050
ground water well water any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

184
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,940
water or do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know</font>

185
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,830
everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the whole agriculture</font>

186
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,420
industry should be held equally

187
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,600
responsible I think everyone should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

188
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,130
held responsible because it's a

189
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,960
community thing right I think we're not

190
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,970
really going to get anywhere if we blame

191
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,910
one crop over another or one area of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

192
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,650
state<font color="#E5E5E5"> over another I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that the I</font>

193
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,000
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the industry needs to band</font>

194
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,530
together but that's a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> tough thing</font>

195
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,610
to do right um yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you think that</font>

196
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,940
certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> types of high water usage crops</font>

197
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,250
should be banned from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the area in</font>

198
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,440
California which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> most severely</font>

199
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,330
affected by the drought do you think

200
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,280
that's fair or do you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

201
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,980
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone in a certain area should</font>

202
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,480
be metered by the state of California to

203
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,520
you know only allocate a certain amount

204
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,090
of water yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know what</font>

205
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,130
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a good answer for that is to</font>

206
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">start really monitoring today how much</font>

207
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">ground water people are using is that's</font>

208
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,120
something that's not done I think as

209
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,740
soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we start really monitoring and</font>

210
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,390
seeing how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much water is used that might</font>

211
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,670
be a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> step but outright going</font>

212
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,470
and banning one kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of crop I don't</font>

213
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,580
think it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really solve the</font>

214
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,040
problem what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

215
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,140
concept of paying for water to be

216
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,180
delivered you know let's say to your

217
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,150
farm and stored in silos or giant

218
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:24,110
reservoirs you know if like the aquifers

219
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,090
run out as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we've seen they're</font>

220
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,760
just drilling away yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

221
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,440
paying for water and storing it I think

222
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just is going to mean that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

223
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,219
people are farms with a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money are</font>

224
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:35,809
going to survive<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to push out</font>

225
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,099
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the small farmers which is</font>

226
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,549
going to be pretty unfortunate<font color="#CCCCCC"> did you</font>

227
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:43,370
visit any farms that had meters on their

228
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:47,450
water pumps um I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we did is</font>

229
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,650
that something that your family does

230
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,710
with your<font color="#CCCCCC"> pistachio farms no but it's uh</font>

231
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,590
something

232
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,710
going on in certain areas of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Central</font>

233
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">Valley and certain areas are not being</font>

234
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,160
metered and that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current situation</font>

235
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,010
right now that is a little bit difficult

236
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">for some areas that are metered and some</font>

237
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,220
that aren't and are not and so I was

238
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">just wondering</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if that was um something</font>

239
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,410
that you noticed but maybe in the area

240
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you wear that you visited it was</font>

241
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,390
not a metered yet because it it you know

242
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,400
it could have had the senior water right

243
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,550
people uh yeah no I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't don't think we</font>

244
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">bleeped we visited any meat at farms</font>

245
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,240
awesome alright well thanks for

246
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,280
answering my questions cool thanks man

247
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,590
thanks for coming on thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you all right</font>

248
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,860
Matt thanks a lot man so Neelu as you

249
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,350
can probably guess we are got some more

250
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">people on the internet who want to talk</font>

251
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,270
to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and let's talk to Eric he's on</font>

252
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,650
skype and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think he's in Madison</font>

253
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,940
Wisconsin yep that's me um uh hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> Neil oh</font>

254
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,930
hey Eric how's it going good um so I um

255
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,770
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been writing about the drought for</font>

256
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:59,580
400 a few months<font color="#E5E5E5"> for slate and I also</font>

257
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,770
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a trip out there last year and</font>

258
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,810
didn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend as much time as as I</font>

259
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:09,030
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to but it seems like um we sort</font>

260
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,100
of came to similar conclusions that it's

261
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,910
just like daunting<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean to drive to I</font>

262
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,620
grew up in Kansas and driving through

263
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">the central valley was agriculture</font>

264
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,120
unlike anything I've ever seen it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

265
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,860
just so mind-blowing where you have

266
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,440
these giant dairy farms right next to

267
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,240
vineyards and I mean everyone wants to

268
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,390
think that that Oh California wine is so

269
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,610
like you know beautiful vineyards up on

270
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,750
the hill and everything it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like</font>

271
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,610
mass produced in the middle of a feedlot

272
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,670
basically it was crazy to me to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

273
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,890
but I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you did you have any</font>

274
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">like really striking image that that</font>

275
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,240
that you brought away from your trip

276
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,130
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean the only times that I've</font>

277
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">ever visited California have been on the</font>

278
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,130
coast so actually being able to go

279
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,050
inland and being in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the valleys you</font>

280
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,340
would just<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive up and just be</font>

281
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,900
overwhelmed with all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

282
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,790
agriculture you'd see orchards and

283
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,320
everything and to me what was the most

284
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,450
striking was seeing the all the baby

285
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,910
orchards being planted and I couldn't

286
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but just have like star wars empire</font>

287
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,320
stray

288
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,150
stacked theme<font color="#CCCCCC"> song like march of the</font>

289
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">stormtroopers just in my head as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I saw</font>

290
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,280
all those tiny tiny trees being grown at

291
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,620
the height of the drought but yes that

292
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,930
was really interesting for me to see ya

293
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,570
in one thing that I think is super

294
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:23,020
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to remember is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the more</font>

295
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,880
trees that are planted the more this

296
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,220
extreme water use gets locked in for

297
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">years and years to come so it's not just</font>

298
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:35,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a rice field or or or cotton or</font>

299
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,940
something like that that can just be

300
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,370
shut down if there's an extreme job like

301
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,320
they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just basically cut these</font>

302
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,170
trees down if they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't if they run out</font>

303
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,730
of water for them or<font color="#E5E5E5"> or that that</font>

304
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,620
investment is losses so in your

305
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">conversation with the farmers did you</font>

306
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,470
talk about the future at all I mean like

307
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,450
five to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten years down the road are they</font>

308
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:58,480
thinking that far out or because the the

309
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,220
longer term climate projections are

310
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,020
truly terrifying I mean this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

311
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,290
permanent drought for decades<font color="#CCCCCC"> um yeah</font>

312
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,090
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a particularly</font>

313
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,910
strong drought this the last few years

314
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,280
but it seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

315
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,320
like a preview of the future I know I

316
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,670
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to call this piece</font>

317
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything is terrible because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

318
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,300
walked<font color="#E5E5E5"> away being like god damn it this</font>

319
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,160
is this drought isn't saying and it's

320
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,380
projected that you know these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

321
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be more frequent and more intense but</font>

322
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have farmers that I spoke to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

323
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">the thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> struck me the most is</font>

324
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,360
that the eternal optimism that they have

325
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,280
like farmers have to be eternal optimist

326
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,440
right they have to believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font>

327
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,120
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to rain and so people that I talk</font>

328
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,040
to five ten years down the line when I

329
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,060
asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> them what do you think their</font>

330
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,380
business is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be like every 10</font>

331
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,300
adamant like we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be here the</font>

332
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,070
future of California farming is going to

333
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,450
be here and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

334
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,360
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just a dry spell so I think I</font>

335
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,920
don't know I mean it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just seems</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

336
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,830
they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to believe that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because it is</font>

337
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,410
so so difficult right now not to say

338
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,420
that farmers think that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a normal</font>

339
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know weather pattern and everyone</font>

340
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,720
thinks this way but everyone that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

341
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,270
spoke<font color="#E5E5E5"> to was really just unfailingly</font>

342
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,090
optimistic they didn't have any plans

343
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">for less water use they just said that</font>

344
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,600
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it through and we're</font>

345
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,360
going to be there it just seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

346
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,980
there's such a sharp disconnect between

347
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,690
what the science is saying and<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do</font>

348
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">they talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

349
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,890
it change at all or I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I</font>

350
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,420
know that is a really conservative part

351
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,740
of the state and you did a great job

352
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,640
highlighting how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just got this thing</font>

353
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,790
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter words they said be sure to to</font>

354
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,620
emphasize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the drought is a real</font>

355
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,470
bitch<font color="#E5E5E5"> bastard so it's like this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

356
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,630
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is just slapping people</font>

357
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,820
in the face and<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you said it's just</font>

358
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">the people with money come out on top</font>

359
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,450
and and I don't know if there's any way

360
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,370
to break that cycle but it's just I mean

361
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,070
it feels like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people that are</font>

362
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,140
benefiting now will continue to benefit

363
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,360
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the even more pronounced way as the</font>

364
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,210
job gets worse totally yeah I mean there

365
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,010
is a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> sharp disconnect with what</font>

366
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,470
you know Jay Famiglietti the NASA Jet

367
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,480
Propulsion Laboratory scientists was

368
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,040
saying and what other farmers that we

369
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,300
were speaking to were saying farmers

370
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,610
were saying that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just a dry</font>

371
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:06,990
period and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move past it</font>

372
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jay was like everything is terrible and</font>

373
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,140
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to conserve water immediately</font>

374
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,760
yeah so there is that disconnect but

375
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,200
people definitely are feeling the

376
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,760
affects of the drought and what's really

377
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,830
interesting is that the techniques to

378
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,660
save water you know different kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

379
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,160
irrigation that are more specialized

380
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,530
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really expensive you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know it</font>

381
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,840
costs a lot to be more efficient so the

382
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,250
people that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come out on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> top</font>

383
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,990
are people that can afford to be more

384
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,200
efficient yeah and those are those are

385
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,870
those are the people that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> torpedoing</font>

386
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,330
the whole system you know I with like

387
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,540
their contributions to politics and I I

388
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,400
don't know it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't seem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fair I</font>

389
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,770
mean I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know yeah everyone wins</font>

390
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,830
except nobody so yeah super fun great

391
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,870
well if it yeah thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you for this story</font>

392
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,640
is super important thank you awesome

393
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,680
thank you yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you very much</font>

394
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,750
for coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> on uh my friend Eric that was</font>

395
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">very nice of you michael haney Lou I</font>

396
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,980
have a surprise<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you oh this ain't</font>

397
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,540
gonna be interesting I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

398
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,980
running on the theme that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything is</font>

399
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,750
terrible I think it'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> great to</font>

400
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,060
cut to clip number four were I've been

401
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,710
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about Jay Famiglietti or NASA</font>

402
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,720
JPL scientists that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked to be</font>

403
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,400
really cool to hear from him and what

404
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,170
he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> been saying that sounds great why</font>

405
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:19,200
don't we show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you that clip them do you</font>

406
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,030
have any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of idea of how much</font>

407
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,640
depletion we've seen and how much ground

408
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,530
water we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> left in the state we've</font>

409
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:28,470
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the last four years using five</font>

410
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,390
and a half trillion gallons of ground

411
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,860
water per year there's all

412
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,160
kinds of issues that<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest that we are</font>

413
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,660
past sustainability tipping points how

414
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,060
drastic of a change you have to make to

415
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,050
get back there or try<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait we're not</font>

416
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:48,019
coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> back I don't think to</font>

417
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:52,200
sustainability meaning we only use what

418
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,360
the amount that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> being replenished so I</font>

419
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,029
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> our best bet is to figure out how</font>

420
00:15:57,029 --> 00:15:59,610
to slow the rate of depletion that

421
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:03,300
sounds depressing it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> depressing well</font>

422
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,970
now that I've depressed you that was a

423
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:08,279
clip from Jay Famiglietti and yeah I

424
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,990
mean he's really adamant that we have to

425
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,790
conserve what we have left and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

426
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,589
that the reason why we're in the place

427
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:15,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we are is that groundwater</font>

428
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,490
exploration is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very new and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

429
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,899
something that Jays been pioneering at

430
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:24,060
NASA so yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so hey um you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

431
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,310
yesterday I talked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone on the</font>

432
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:29,339
internet name was<font color="#CCCCCC"> David Cox he is a math</font>

433
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:31,649
teacher and he lives in Porterville

434
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:33,120
California which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

435
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,040
affected places by the drought send us a

436
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,600
couple of questions for you be a direct

437
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,970
message so I want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a look at</font>

438
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">these and two things you wanted to know</font>

439
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:43,290
are their crops that should be grown in

440
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,910
California<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the conditions are</font>

441
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,070
best for those crops in California and

442
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,110
two are there some crops that could be

443
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:52,410
grown elsewhere because there aren't the

444
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,079
same water problems in other places what

445
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:56,519
do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that yeah these are</font>

446
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,170
great questions so I'll start with

447
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,899
number one partly to prove<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm not</font>

448
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:02,699
an almond hater which is the entire

449
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:04,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet has been saying that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I hate</font>

450
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:06,030
almonds but almonds are actually really

451
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,189
well-suited to grow in California

452
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:10,380
because California is a Mediterranean

453
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,579
climate and that's where almonds have

454
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:14,189
been grown traditionally and just the

455
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:16,410
issue that some critics have been having

456
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,059
with almonds being grown in California

457
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:20,640
is just the the outright explosion of

458
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,650
almond orchards in the state they've

459
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,720
doubled their acreage in the past<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

460
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,099
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so when that's happening</font>

461
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,020
during the drought that that's kind of

462
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,250
problematic with the water intensive

463
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,700
crop so number<font color="#CCCCCC"> two where you know what</font>

464
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,100
crops can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we grow elsewhere dairy can be</font>

465
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,200
grown mostly anywhere so it would be

466
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,330
great to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that maybe move out of</font>

467
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,770
california see what that<font color="#CCCCCC"> does for the</font>

468
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,990
drought the problem is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean dairy is a</font>

469
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,710
you know

470
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,659
it's Garner's a lot of money<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

471
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:48,880
farming industry so be tough to move

472
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,179
that economy out of the state yeah you

473
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:55,000
know that's that's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> true I David I</font>

474
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,470
hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answers your questions thanks</font>

475
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,350
for sending those to us and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Neelu how do</font>

476
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,429
you feel about talking some more<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

477
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:02,649
in skype<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would love nothing more all</font>

478
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:03,940
right then<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a good thing we've got</font>

479
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">Roberto here for you let's say to</font>

480
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,580
Roberto<font color="#CCCCCC"> heriberto I knew how are you I'm</font>

481
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:13,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">excellent how are you I'm great I'm in</font>

482
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,789
North Carolina so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty hot humid</font>

483
00:18:15,789 --> 00:18:18,940
and it rained like crazy yesterday so I

484
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,330
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys sell the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

485
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,630
of California could use its kind of rain

486
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,340
and I actually have friends and<font color="#E5E5E5"> family</font>

487
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">in California friends in the Central</font>

488
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,200
Valley and they were telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> me about</font>

489
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,409
how difficult has been for them now<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

490
00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:38,919
that note my question for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you is that</font>

491
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:40,630
what impact do you think the drought has

492
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,520
on vulnerable communities like the

493
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">Latino farm workers with this drought</font>

494
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,679
yeah i mean overall the job number job

495
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:53,200
lost numbers that that we've seen in

496
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">california haven't been as low as it's</font>

497
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,370
been projected during this drought

498
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,070
because of just how<font color="#CCCCCC"> much ground water is</font>

499
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,690
being used by the AG industry so they're

500
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,909
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> a different source of water and</font>

501
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,309
being able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> no just completely not</font>

502
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:08,919
ruin all of the jobs in the industry but

503
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:10,659
having said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i talked to a farmer</font>

504
00:19:10,659 --> 00:19:12,880
outside of los bonos and he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling</font>

505
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,320
me he's had farmers that that have

506
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,090
worked her farm workers who have worked

507
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">for him for decades and he has to lay</font>

508
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:19,870
them off because he's following his

509
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,149
fields maybe he doesn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the option</font>

510
00:19:22,149 --> 00:19:23,860
to lean on groundwater like other farms

511
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,409
do so yeah on the micro level absolutely

512
00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:30,549
people are being impacted now on the

513
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:32,980
climb inside the one of the things

514
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,200
that's really interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> about climate</font>

515
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,809
change that is actually visible its

516
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:41,640
extreme events like rainfall<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

517
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,039
droughts and heat waves and you

518
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,020
mentioned climate change at the end of

519
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,140
your piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I want to know what is it</font>

520
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,139
about climate change that is going to

521
00:19:53,139 --> 00:19:54,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">make the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> droughts wars why is it going</font>

522
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the droughts wars in the future</font>

523
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,559
so I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best person to answer</font>

524
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:01,149
this question the best person is rob

525
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,580
eshman he is our environment editor so

526
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,620
you can just send up a barrage of tweets

527
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,230
at Robert S a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Schulman but just kind of</font>

528
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,480
the light answer is that our climate<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

529
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,250
changing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of rainfall and</font>

530
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,230
snowfall<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting is you know</font>

531
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,059
not going to be is not going to be the

532
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:17,169
same water isn't going to be this

533
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:19,240
amazing abundant resource from surface

534
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,429
water that we've seen you know for for

535
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:23,200
hundreds of years past so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

536
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be our new normal so droughts like</font>

537
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,100
this are projected to you know continue

538
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,649
to happen in to get worse but to get to

539
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:31,299
the nitty-gritty<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rob is definitely a</font>

540
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:34,090
your man great great that's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font>

541
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'll definitely send them a few tweaks</font>

542
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,909
now on that note there are certain

543
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:42,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">things in the natural variability of the</font>

544
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:44,409
climate that to tend to quench the

545
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,510
thirst of places like<font color="#E5E5E5"> california and one</font>

546
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:49,240
of those is El Nino and this year<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

547
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,799
supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> powerful El</font>

548
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,919
Nino at least at some of the projections

549
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:57,340
and what do you think the what do you

550
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">think the copious amount</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of rain that</font>

551
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:01,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">might occur will due to the drought will</font>

552
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:04,450
it make<font color="#CCCCCC"> a significant dent in the</font>

553
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:08,169
drought or will it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not be enough at</font>

554
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:11,409
all well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just I just read a figure</font>

555
00:21:11,409 --> 00:21:13,960
that NASA predicts that will need about

556
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,960
11 trillion gallons of water<font color="#CCCCCC"> to end the</font>

557
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,730
drought so if it rains that much

558
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,620
everything I guess is going to be great

559
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,679
maybe but no it'd be great to have water

560
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">to replenish our surface water to have</font>

561
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:27,520
you know enough water back in our rivers

562
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,380
lakes and streams but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not going to</font>

563
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,090
solve the problem of all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> groundwater</font>

564
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,850
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were depleting you know this takes</font>

565
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,740
millions of years for these aquifers to

566
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,539
build up these water sources for us to

567
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:40,450
use so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know the ground ground</font>

568
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,580
water is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to it's a finite</font>

569
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,950
resource unfortunately so a lot of rain

570
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,330
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be great but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it will</font>

571
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,120
solve all of California's problems Oh

572
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,389
nuts oh well well here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hoping that</font>

573
00:21:52,389 --> 00:21:54,039
it's a really really big El Nino and

574
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:56,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">then hits California I know that is the</font>

575
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,919
water a part of it 11 trillion gallons

576
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,980
of water please that would be awesome

577
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,570
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just just hopefully not too</font>

578
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,450
many really detrimental impacts like

579
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,100
landslides but

580
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,419
you know the water part would certainly

581
00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:12,880
help well thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answering my</font>

582
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,120
questions and you really great<font color="#CCCCCC"> job with</font>

583
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,950
the documentary thank you thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

584
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,830
watching<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so Neelu we're almost</font>

585
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,090
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but we got this</font>

586
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,770
one tweet that I want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

587
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:28,360
at from century 360 and he has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been here</font>

588
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,240
he or she has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been hearing a lot about</font>

589
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,740
Nestle's bottling plant in California

590
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,860
and wondering is that really a

591
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,660
significant problem or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know why did</font>

592
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,059
you decide to focus on agricultural uses

593
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:41,650
of water as opposed to like looking at

594
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:44,140
nestle well yeah I've been seeing a lot

595
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,630
of that as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well Nestle's bottling plants</font>

596
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,429
in California and as well in Canada

597
00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:50,200
where I'm from there's a lot of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

598
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,730
internet petitions and stuff like that

599
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:54,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">but the water use of agriculture</font>

600
00:22:54,429 --> 00:22:56,200
absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dwarfs Nestle's bottling</font>

601
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,600
plant so that's maybe why it's not

602
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,880
getting enough attention so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'd</font>

603
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,740
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> really cool if we just could throw to</font>

604
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,630
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> first clip where you can see exactly</font>

605
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,580
what it looks like from above when

606
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,440
farmers are using flood irrigation to

607
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,210
flood their fields it's a method<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

608
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,590
used in almost half the farms in

609
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,620
California

610
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we're flying over this big irrigation</font>

611
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:21,230
