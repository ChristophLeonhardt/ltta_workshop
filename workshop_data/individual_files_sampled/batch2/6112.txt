a so-called prosperity gospel pastor has been indicted for not only scamming the people who follow him but also alleged massive tax fraud and other scams related to him and his preaching so this is Todd Koontz and apparently he there's William Todd ku that picture is worth a thousand words and then so it looks like you just got caught with his hand in the cookie jar that's like the perfect picture for this story but anyway so many different things in that picture anyway yes yes so he has been indicted and he has been accused of participating in a check-cashing scheme involving travel reimbursements for speaking appearances and for book sales and then filing fraudulent tax returns in order to hide the money so here's what he does and first of all if you're a bad guy you know this is this is a pretty clever way of dodging taxes right and getting a little extra money so he would pretend like he was going on you know speaking tours related to his work and things like that work-related travel essentially and then he would bill the church that he was working at to reimburse him and when they would reimburse him for four tours that he didn't even take right travel did he didn't even do for work when they would reimburse him well that's not taxed right so he would just cash that money which he didn't earn he wouldn't get taxed on it and there goes the whole tax fraud scam um to give you a sense of scale he he did this for with a hundred and two checks between the years 2010 and 2013 so the tune of two hundred and fifty two thousand dollars and then the next year in 2014 he did 432 checks for one hundred and five thousand five hundred dollars so there's a lot of money we're talking about and I would like this Ruthann again on one point you said it's a pretty clever scheme apparently not we got caught he's probably well he got caught because he got greedy and oftentimes oftentimes people get too greedy and that is when they get caught I mean I could totally if he didn't do it on such a large scale I think that he'd get away with it but I mean think about the amount of money that he stole from the church on top of stealing money people who think hey if I give this dude a couple hundred bucks I'll somehow become wealthy Jesus will somehow like sprinkle cash on me he'll make it rain right no that's not how it works please don't be scammed by nut jobs like this guy his whole existence is a scam but it wasn't enough he had to go over the top and get and do things that are illegal so tell him about the the essence of the scam of of prosperity gospel okay so he build the churches where he made appearances for a full fare first-class ticket while purchasing tickets for substantially less so that was another thing that he did right well I give him that one cuz the dude had to fly in coach and he looks like a big guy so you probably at least suffered on them he didn't have to fly in coach though he flew in coach just so he can make a little extra money by the way I'm about to tell you like how much wealth he has in just a second by the way he promised untold wealth for his followers for the price of a two hundred seventy three dollar donation calling it a recovery seed okay so that's my favorite part of the story that's the point that's not illegal that's perfectly fine that's the prosperity gospel a lot of preachers white and black are doing it all across the country and demanding tons of money from people and they say you give me two hundred seventy three million dollars I give you miracle kind of it's coming later and they specifically say you give us money now you will get more money later it's not like oh you'll get a prayer and your ankle will get fixed and yada yada or spot in heaven know you'll get richer later and but this persists it's from it's gonna be fine and he's insane and so people yeah sure take my money take my money and then after he has all this money that again Anna's gonna tell you to say it easy fresh is not enough but if you're a professional scam artist like this you think why not scam the government to tell a jail cell might be why not but so here's here's a little taste of how wealthy this guy is because of all these scams so his church even paid for his condo which is worth 1.5 million dollars okay also keep in mind that he had not one not two but three BMW two Ferraris a Maserati and a Land Rover why do you need that many cars why I just don't understand by the way I'm not in the business of telling people what they can and can't have if you can afford it and you want that many cars so be it good luck whatever right but if you are literally taking advantage of people exploiting them in their time of need and scamming the government by evading taxes and doing all the shady stuff like really you did all of that all of that just so you can afford like what 50 cars how many cars do you need I just don't understand by the way like one BMW is enough one Maserati is enough one Ram lot Land Rover is enough but this dude it's just not enough he's so freakin greedy that it's never enough it's like the donor class I've got 40 billion dollars but I want another billion dollar tax break so I'm gonna make sure you get kicked off a healthcare tour so I can get it okay now look I hate to say it but or maybe I don't hate to say no I am hesitating so that I do hate to say it some religious folks definitely not all religious folks okay come on man really it's a recovery seed you know what that means by the way that you're already in bad shape and then you're gonna pay two hundred and seventy three dollars when you're in bad shape so you can recover right and you're gonna give it if your pastor shows up in a Ferrari he might not be the right pastor so Jesus told you to give away all of your worldly possessions just crack the book open I I'm not a believer I don't believe in any of the books but if you do believe in the books try reading a page or two first of all you might be shocked at what's in there second of all you'll find out the good thing about Christianity is bad stuff but there's the good thing about Christianity is that that Jesus cared so much about the poor and the needy and he didn't drive a Maserati how gullible are you stop giving this money to these scam artists membership helps fund the Young Turks you don't want great thing about that that means we're not accountable to anyone but you guys that's why we're strong other because we built a show around you come build it even bigger and better at TYT Network comm
