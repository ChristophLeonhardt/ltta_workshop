benda chaos and confusion and cruelty created by the Trump administration's force separations of families first lady Melania Trump made her second trip to the border providing another PR push to paper over what remains a bureaucratic catastrophe on Tuesday night a Republican appointed Republican appointed federal judge in California gave the white house 30 days to reunify migrant families separated the border and the judge's ruling he wrote the unfortunate reality is that under the present system migrant children are not accounted for with the same efficiency and accuracy as property certainly that cannot justify or satisfy the requirements of due process placing the burden on the parents to find a request unification with their children under the circumstances presented here is backwards the judge also issued a nationwide injunction against further family separations the Justice Department has not indicated if it will appeal the injunction against the judge anyone is Senate hearing Health and Human Services Secretary Alex's are who is responsible for these children struggle to say with any clarity how many had in fact been reunified that's why it's the secretary I wanted to know about the children in your department custody how many of them have been reunified well that's exactly what I'm saying they have been placed with a parent or other relative who's a man United States many several hundred of now the of the 2,300 plus that were that weed that came into our care harmonium twenty forty seven forms from a US congressman Adriana espy I'd Democrat from New York City Thank You congressman thank you so tell me you've been out there you know what we don't know what's it like on the ground with these kids well I went to visit one of the centers were that's providing services for them and they told me that there's 239 of them there a hundred of which have been placed with some relative now these kids are coming with little notes attached with a safety pin that's how they're getting them together with their relatives the federal government is doing very little to reconnect these children back with their families now I met with some of the fathers at the federal facility on Father's Day and they told me how their children were being ripped away from them in fact many of them were just broke down because they told us how at the border when they were questioned the first thing that came to question was whether or not they were the real dad so we're alleging that there were trafficking young children and so many of them when they told the story they broke down so this is what's going on on the ground these children are not being held by government it is in fact the service providers that are doing much of the groundwork they came from Arizona from California there's seven hundred plus of them in New York State 230 and nine of them in my district and I went to visit them they're resilient kids but I cannot cannot guarantee you that they haven't been traumatized and you're up on the border between Manhattan in the Bronx that's correct us let me ask you about the about this talk about trafficking what is that is that just a bogus claim who's saying there's been trafficking with these kids well if one of the males if her father is coming with their child because than a father is the one also that brings the children because that's a very dangerous journey sure so immediately the allegation would be is that your child and anning what they told us was that the children were holding on to their legs well they know it why are they challenging that why do they think that's I think that's just the modus operandi down there at the border well hundreds of demonstrators stormed a Senate office but here in Washington early today to protest the Trump administration's forced family separations for more than five hundred people were arrested today they're some of them are is they chanted abolish ice many were wearing the same Melora mylar blankets that were distributed to migrants show them at the border those are the things that looks alike you know aluminum paper anyway congressman Palmer Pramila Jaya Paul is one of the people arrested swatch I just got arrested I don't know exactly how many but over 500 women at least 500 women who took over the center of the heart Senate building protesting the inhumane and cruel zero-tolerance policy of Donald Trump in this administration the separation of families the caging of children the imprisonment of asylum seekers who just seek a better life now Congress has an oversight role here you have a judge's and join them to get these kids home their parents in 30 days how do you guys well first of all that judge was very clear thirty days and two weeks if the child is on the five years old so clearly this and that's a present danger clear and present danger for these children as we should be holding hearings immediately on this situation of with these children and how they've been ripped away from their families that's just no way about it I will continue to visit some of these sites I'm going back again this week and see how their background is Dominican
