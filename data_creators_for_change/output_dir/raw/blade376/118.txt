00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone I want to talk about video</font>

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,510
which went viral today called my tram

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:04,950
experience if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't seen it</font>

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,080
already click the annotation go check it

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,200
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then come back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to this one the</font>

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,870
woman in it with her child used a lot of

7
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,219
verbal violence with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

8
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,279
her a lot of racism<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was clear</font>

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,170
that the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> she was saying what she</font>

10
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,570
said was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> emotional and what she had</font>

11
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,230
said was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very irrational and it caused</font>

12
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,710
mass outrage but looking at the points

13
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,529
of discussion have been made<font color="#CCCCCC"> by people</font>

14
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:32,940
all over the world who have responded to

15
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,500
this video I've noticed there have been

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,840
a lot of comments and backlash which

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,809
have also been very<font color="#E5E5E5"> emotional and very</font>

18
00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:41,579
irrational so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first comment I saw</font>

19
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,309
quite a lot was comments of complete

20
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:49,079
shock oh my god<font color="#E5E5E5"> OMG</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I found</font>

21
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">that really interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,489
i do understand why people felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> shocked</font>

23
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:55,710
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's not every day that you</font>

24
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,190
see people spouting racism in public or

25
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,370
perhaps it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the people that</font>

26
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,680
were shocked to that video<font color="#E5E5E5"> are those who</font>

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,659
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> just witnessed something that did</font>

28
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,400
not relate to their usual frame of

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,560
reference because the truth is racism is

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,960
real and this video brought that issue

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,869
to the forefront the second comment<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

32
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:19,200
saw used quite a lot was she represents

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,420
everything that is wrong in society<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

34
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,310
she doesn't represent everything but

35
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,710
when people use that phrase they tend to

36
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,960
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's her alone you know</font>

37
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,409
isolated it's it's her just her that

38
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:33,960
represents what's wrong with society but

39
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">people tend to forget that human beings</font>

40
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,250
are brought up in society they are

41
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,100
shaped and molded by society and

42
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,520
therefore if you find a trait in a human

43
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,509
being which is completely abhorrence

44
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:49,590
then you need to find what the root

45
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,280
causes and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> root cause will be found</font>

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,560
within the fabrics of the society<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

47
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,810
they were brought up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a fact now</font>

48
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,520
the third comment was probably the one I

49
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,130
saw most frequently posted and it

50
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,930
related to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact the woman had a</font>

51
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,790
child on her lap and it was the comment

52
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,340
I feel sorry for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the child but there's a</font>

53
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,860
sad irony with that because<font color="#CCCCCC"> people tend</font>

54
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,319
to forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that woman was once a</font>

55
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,190
child

56
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,720
and perhaps what you saw in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that video</font>

57
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,840
was exactly the same upbringing that

58
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">woman had when she was younger and</font>

59
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,710
therefore it now becomes an issue of

60
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,110
breaking the cycle do we condemn this

61
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,480
person or do we actually do same about

62
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">it to ensure that the cycle is broken</font>

63
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,420
and this never happens again and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am by</font>

64
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,220
no means saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> I excuse the behavior</font>

65
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,710
and I'm not saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that her upbringing</font>

66
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,110
is the only factor either but I say it's

67
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,760
a significant one that must<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

68
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,710
considered I am someone with the view

69
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,060
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are all victims of our</font>

70
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,680
environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> now there are many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

71
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">that criticize me for that and say that</font>

72
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,370
environment is only part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

73
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,650
for people's actions so therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> I then</font>

74
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,930
asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question well what else is a</font>

75
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,330
factor because if any of the facts as

76
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,640
those people mention are external<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

77
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,340
that human being then that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a part of</font>

78
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,260
their environment that is a part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

79
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,660
their frame of reference<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've also been</font>

80
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,100
criticized for having that viewpoint

81
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,110
because I'm somehow suggesting that we

82
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,930
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have responsibility that the fact</font>

83
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,060
that that woman did have<font color="#CCCCCC"> responsibility</font>

84
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,490
she did have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> choice but once again</font>

85
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,800
going back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience yet she may</font>

86
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,080
have had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a choice but when someone has a</font>

87
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,600
choice it's based on a selection of

88
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,640
choices and therefore if growing<font color="#E5E5E5"> up she</font>

89
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,800
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> brought up in a family where she was</font>

90
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,950
only exposed to racism<font color="#E5E5E5"> and bigotry how</font>

91
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,020
would she<font color="#CCCCCC"> have had the ability to choose</font>

92
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">any other way that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> she was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not made</font>

93
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,400
aware of does that make sense and just

94
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,440
to back up my point with some examples

95
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,680
and back in the day if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can call it</font>

96
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,260
that um if you were growing up in Rome

97
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,810
you may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> told by your parents hey if</font>

98
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,090
you're really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good if you're well</font>

99
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,860
behaved for the rest of the week we'll

100
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,780
take you down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the arena and we can</font>

101
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,970
watch people being fed to lions which

102
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,860
probably sounds trivial what I'm saying

103
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,769
but back then in that environment that

104
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:03,660
is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> people believe because that was</font>

105
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,220
the culture they lived<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that was the</font>

106
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,400
society<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they were shaped by if you</font>

107
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,340
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> born in Nazi Germany with a Nazi</font>

108
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,690
family and you had no other external

109
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,950
conflicting opinions which may have

110
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,839
steered you away from what you were

111
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,450
taught<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chances are you would have</font>

112
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,270
become a Nazi and with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in mind you</font>

113
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:28,170
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start to see that we are victims of</font>

114
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,790
our environment so where does

115
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,890
responsibility come from where it<font color="#CCCCCC"> comes</font>

116
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,620
from society like a person<font color="#E5E5E5"> who has some</font>

117
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,510
disposable<font color="#E5E5E5"> income and decides to give it</font>

118
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,180
to charity like a person who<font color="#CCCCCC"> has some</font>

119
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,710
spare time and therefore does some

120
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,900
volunteering work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and like a person who</font>

121
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,910
chooses to do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> job not because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

122
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,040
pay but because of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> value they can</font>

123
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,350
contribute<font color="#E5E5E5"> to society basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

124
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,420
saying the responsibility comes from us

125
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,750
the people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see that video of</font>

126
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,120
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> woman being racist and know that it</font>

127
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,460
is wrong because clearly she didn't know

128
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,320
it was wrong clearly she was uneducated

129
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,830
or was misguided with her beliefs it all

130
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,780
comes down to the essence of empathy

131
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,970
because if humanity was purely

132
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,350
empathetic hypothetically<font color="#CCCCCC"> speaking then</font>

133
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,730
hatred would no longer exist on this

134
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,740
planet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's because we would become</font>

135
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,230
one we would understand the pain that we

136
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,170
calls to someone when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do wrong and on</font>

137
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,640
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> flip side we would understand the</font>

138
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,800
pleasure we give other people when we

139
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,230
help those that need helping you may

140
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,550
have decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> to call the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> woman on the</font>

141
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,040
video sick without truly realizing what

142
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,930
you were saying because<font color="#CCCCCC"> she may be sick</font>

143
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,810
and sick people need helping they need

144
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,290
treating they need rehabilitating<font color="#E5E5E5"> order</font>

145
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,810
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just need condemning because that's</font>

146
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,970
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what I have seen today and some</font>

147
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">of you may argue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that because she's an</font>

148
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,320
adult she's had so much momentum already

149
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">in her life of experiences which have</font>

150
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,520
pushed her in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this direction that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll</font>

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">be almost impossible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for us to steer</font>

back on the right path<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's just</font>

153
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">not the case I've seen it with my own</font>
