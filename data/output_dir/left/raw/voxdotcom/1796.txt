1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,220
What do you think of when you hear the word
“war?”

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,000
Is it this?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,500
Or maybe this?

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,240
Well, there’s a different type of war you
may have heard a lot about recently.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,200
Trade war worries igniting.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,060
Is the trade war back on?

7
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:15,860
Trade war.

8
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:16,360
Trade war.

9
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:16,880
Full-blown trade war.

10
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,180
The “weapons” in a trade war are everywhere.

11
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,070
It's the food you eat.

12
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,269
The train you ride to work.

13
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:27,510
And the laptop you’re probably watching
this video on.

14
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,070
As a consumer you're probably consuming imports.

15
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:36,090
If we have a trade war and we start slapping
tariffs on all of those imports, the bill

16
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,370
is going to be higher.

17
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,280
If the world relies so much on trade, what
is a trade war and why do countries get caught

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,880
up in them in the first place?

19
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,980
Alright, global trade can be a dry topic so
let’s jazz this up a little bit.

20
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,980
To avoid any spoilers, let’s say it’s
season one of Game of Thrones and both the

21
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:59,670
Tyrell and the Lannister kingdoms manufacture…
googly eyes.

22
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,180
The Tyrells then start to subsidize googly
eye manufacturing in their kingdom.

23
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:08,400
That basically means that the Tyrells are paying
at least part of the cost of manufacturing,

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,930
reducing the cost for buyers.

25
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:15,930
The Lannisters are understandably upset — why
would anyone want to buy their more expensive

26
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:16,930
product?

27
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:21,800
They could try and negotiate with the Tyrells
or they could choose to impose tariffs: taxes

28
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,240
on imports that raise the cost of those goods.

29
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,190
Which in this case, would punish the Tyrells.

30
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:32,750
With the tariffs in place, if the Tyrells
tried to export goods to the Lannisters, they’d

31
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,310
have to pay an extra tax.

32
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,420
The Tyrells could then impose tariffs of their
own.

33
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,580
Now if this disagreement goes back and forth
and escalates with even more tariffs, that

34
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,400
would be considered a trade war.

35
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,240
But trade wars aren’t fiction and there’s
more than one way they can start.

36
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,440
One possibility is you want to keep out
countries import so that your domestic competitors

37
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,760
have an edge.

38
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,220
The second possibility is if there's a country
that is doing something that you don't want them to,

39
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:07,130
you can use a tariff as a way of inflicting
a degree of pain, of economic pain on that

40
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:07,920
country.

41
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,120
And you say until you change your evil ways
I'm going to make it hurt.

42
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,100
Okay, so who “wins” a trade war?

43
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,180
One way to think about who “wins” a trade
war is looking at which country has more targets

44
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,180
to choose from.

45
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,840
The more goods you ship to another country,
the more vulnerable your goods are to punishing

46
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,340
tariffs.

47
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,200
So some economists would say that the country
which ships fewer goods to the other has an

48
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,280
advantage — and can outlast the other in
a big clash.

49
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,920
Trade wars can also boost the fortunes of
countries that stand outside the fray.

50
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,090
In the 1930s, the US enacted the Smoot-Hawley
Tariff Act which put into place steep, sweeping

51
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,800
tariffs on imports as a way to protect American
workers and industries.

52
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,020
Canada and some European countries put up
tariffs of their own, launching a trade war.

53
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,370
Some of these countries then abandoned the
US as a trading ally and took their trading

54
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:58,960
elsewhere.

55
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:04,880
Soviet Russia, a country not involved in the trade
war, ended up gaining trading partners as

56
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,500
a result of Smoot-Hawley.

57
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,660
So sometimes countries not involved in a trade war can benefit from one.

58
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,140
But, as is the case with most wars,

59
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,240
trade wars are harmful for almost everyone involved — particularly

60
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,700
for poorer consumers.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,820
Rising prices in a trade war can have ripple effects.

62
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,540
When people have to spend more money on basics like clothing,

63
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,940
it means they have less money to spend on other goods and services.

64
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,040
And that can dampen the pace of the economy.

65
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:34,620
Traditionally when you've looked at trade protection,
you often put higher protection on goods that are

66
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:35,750
consumed by poor people.

67
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:41,370
There are economists who have documented that
systematically you tend to find higher tariffs

68
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:48,560
on things like low-end clothing, shoes, sugar,
which play a disproportionate

69
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,880
role in the spending of people who are less
was well off.

70
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:58,360
In April, President Trump unveiled a list
of over 1000 Chinese exports — things like

71
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,360
aircraft parts, TVs, and medical devices — that
he planned to place tariffs on, as a way to

72
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,209
to punish Beijing for restricting US investment
in China and for stealing American intellectual

73
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:09,709
property.

74
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,950
The very next day, China struck back, unveiling
its own list of US exports that it planned

75
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,020
to place tariffs on.

76
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:21,240
Since then, Trump has threatened another round
of tariffs, with China ready to respond with

77
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,900
its own additional tariffs.

78
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,320
The whole situation is starting to look a
lot like a trade war.

79
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,419
Countries disagree on fair and unfair trade
practices all the time.

80
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:35,449
But there’s something unique about Trump’s
approach to it: the unpredictability, the

81
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:39,750
wild threats, the disinterest in even pretending
to play by the rules.

82
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,970
Trump isn’t just destabilizing trade relations
with China or any other country he threatens

83
00:04:43,970 --> 00:00:00,000
— he’s destabilizing the entire global system
of trade.
