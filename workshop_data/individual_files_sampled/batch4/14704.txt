the secretary-general of Amnesty International Canada is condemning Israel but he belongs to an anti-semitic Facebook group that thinks the Jews were responsible for 9/11 and I think everybody should know this information before they donate a penny to amnesty according to alleged international human rights organization Amnesty International they say they hold all actors to the same obligations as defined in international human rights laws and standards they say their only goal is to ensure human rights and respect for everyone everywhere okay that sounds nice on its face I mean everybody likes human rights but what Amnesty International doesn't practice is far different from what they say they do as part of their official mandate because amnesty routinely takes the position that terrorists who live in the terrorist autocracy of hamas-controlled Gaza and who routinely use children as human shields are morally superior to the Israeli military and Israeli civilians and when I say Gaza is a terrorist autocracy I'm not exaggerating according to Public Safety Canada who reviewed the status of Hamas as late as 2016 Canada views Hamas as an outlawed terrorist group here in Canada Plus Hamas seized control of Gaza in a bloody coup in 2007 but Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada Alex Neve has been tweeting about the so called land day protests I'll call them a riot happening at the border between Gaza and Israel and pushing an amnesty petition landet sounds nice right except it isn't it's a demand that every Palestinian and their descendants be allowed to return to land they only claim was theirs before the formation of Israel and before they lost a few wars to Israel over the same land the flood of migrants over a running Israel would be in the millions and it's a crazy demand to make to any country that one a few wars that decided these sorts of things already now the petition reads the fact that live ammunition has been used against unarmed protesters is deeply troubling and these deaths must be investigated as possible unlawful killings according to Amnesty 17 Palestinians have been killed 1,400 have been injured and 750 have been hit with a live ammunition again according to Amnesty International while some Palestinian demonstrators have thrown rocks and other objects towards the fence it's hard to believe how this would be an imminent danger to the lives of well equipped soldiers protected by snipers tanks and drones what they weren't an imminent danger they threw rocks at the soldiers stormed the fence tried to tear it down in some cases they even cut through it with wire cutters that's an invasion people you know besides the fact that Hamas has a penchant for strolling up on their targets while wearing suicide vests I mean is this even a legitimate argument now the Israelis are too good at protecting themselves from global jihad they should allow themselves and their people to be injured or murdered or threatened by mob violence just so that the score is a little more even this is a Timbit soccer or peewee hockey where you can't win by too many points because someone's feelings will get hurt this is global jihad life and death imagine making the argument that the Allies killed too many Nazis and that World War two should have been a little more I don't know fair and balanced besides look at these people just look at them would you want them just to saunter into your country or would you want your military to defend you and your border and really those numbers cited by the alleged human rights organization and Mistie international are really just cheap Hamas propaganda which according to Breitbart are taken right from the terrorists government's Ministry of Health so amnesty is parroting jihadi propaganda to shame Israel for defending itself Amnesty got those numbers from Palestinian sources even the left-wing magazine the Guardian which itself is often anti-israel said it could only confirm 275 people went to the local hospital for injuries mostly shrapnel and injuries from gunshots to the leg and of those poor little victims of Israeli violence that Amnesty seemed so concerned about at least 10 of them are known terrorists despite Hamas claims that one of the dead terrorists was just a simple country boy who liked to build sandcastles and take long walks at sunset on the beach even Hamas is now acknowledging at least five of the Dead were officially part of the terror organizations armed military wing but you won't read that in any amnesty international press release in fact when you do go through a de masti International Canada's press releases they have a lot of criticism for the pluralistic multi-faith democracy of Israel but literally none for the other terrorist group Fatah that controls what's known as the West Bank better known as Judea and Samaria Fatah by the way is also on the banned terrorist organization on the list kept by Public Safety Canada but Fatah while they are routinely quoted favorably and treated as victims by Amnesty International and you know what it's never mentioned that Egypt has also closed the border with Gaza for the very same reasons Israel has those reasons being terrorism but that's also another thing you won't read in an amnesty press release but the pro terrorists slant of Amnesty Canada should come as no surprise if you're paying attention and I know I know that's hard to do in a busy world remember when I told you about Alex Neve the secretary-general of Amnesty International Canada here is Alex Neve with convicted terrorist Omar Khadr and his lawyer Dennis Edney Neve was celebrating the ten point five million dollar compensation that Justin Trudeau paid to Taliban terrorists and murderer Omar Khadr for his alleged human rights violations while in American custody and Alex Neve is also a member of a controversial anti-semitic Facebook group called the Palestinian live forum in a detailed 280 page report a researcher and blogger named Dave Collier documented the racist anti-israel material shared by members of the secret group the thing is chalked full of the usual anti-jewish canards allegations of some sort of global Rothschild conspiracy accusing Israel of involvement in the 9/11 and 2015 Paris terror attacks Holocaust denial and depictions of the quote-unquote Israel lobby as a pig this Facebook group made international news when it was revealed that UK Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn was part of this secret group so why is the head of Amnesty International Canada part of it - you can see in dave paul year's report that Alex Nev was part of this group here on page 158 should anyone trust anything amnesty has to say now about Israel when they employ this guy I want everybody to know before they sign an embassy international petition or donate to an amnesty international cause that they are donating to an organization that is headed by someone who is part of a secret anti-semitic anti-jewish pro-nazi Facebook group where members boast of reading mine Kampf and every single criticism of Israel that comes from Amnesty is being written through that same anti-semitic Israel hating lens for the rebel dot media I'm Shiela gunnery at the rebel we try to bring you news that you won't see anywhere else and the good news is you can bring us everywhere now we have a brand new rebel media app you can get it on the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store download it give it a try and take the other side of the news with you wherever you go you
