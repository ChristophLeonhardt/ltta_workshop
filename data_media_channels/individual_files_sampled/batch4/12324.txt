hi Michael I've been watching the Cavanaugh confirmation process as closely as most something's bothering clearly the Democrats are doing whatever they can to delay his confirmation with the hope of retaking the Senate November stalling it indefinitely my question isn't it hypocritical for Senate Republicans to contain a complaint about these blatant political tactics considering that in 2016 they did virtually the same thing in delaying Merrick Garland's confirmation one thing that has driven me crazy about the modern American Left is its inconsistency in ideology an approach to issues so when so-called conservatives have engaged in similar behavior it's troubling thanks and keep up the good work thank you for the question Seth but you are totally wrong I'm sorry to say totally wrong yeah it's true Republicans politically stalled Merrick Garland's nomination we knew it we knew we could do it we knew that the election was going to decide it so we just stalled it forever what we didn't do is call him a rapist crime syndicate mobbed on who just goes around raping women from 36 years ago we didn't do that at all we just delayed it like civilized human beings like people who aren't wicked little hysterical child monsters but what they have done what the left is done here is based on nothing nothing they have tried to ruin a good man's reputation with no evidence if they had any evidence whatsoever if they had any corroboration then maybe you could consider it but there's no corroboration there's nothing sure the people who would be called under corroborated deny that any of it ever happened that have been called on by the accuser it's total nonsense and it's really really wicked and look if they had just said we're not gonna we're not gonna confirm Cavanaugh fine but they couldn't get away with that because they don't have the votes I mean that's what that's politics politics is a blood sport but what they've done to this man is purely wicked
