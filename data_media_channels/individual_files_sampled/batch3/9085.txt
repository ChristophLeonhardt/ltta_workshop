Shannon: BIPARTISAN CALLS, TOO. THANK YOU FOR MONITORING THAT IS OUR NEXT GUEST HAS BEEN FIGHTING A LONG MUCK AROUND THE CLOCK IN AN EFFORT TO GET TO BRUNSON'S RELEASE. WELCOME CONGRESSMAN, MARK WALKER. THANK YOU, SHANNON. GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. Shannon: I KNOW YOU SHARE A KINSHIP. YOU WERE A PASTOR, AS WELL. YOU WERE VERY CONNECTED TO THIS CASE. CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT THE REACTION FROM THE PASTOR OR HIS FAMILY AS HIS GOODNESS INTRODUCED TO SPREAD? IT'S BEEN A CELEBRATION TODAY EVEN WITH US BEING IN THE PATH OF THIS NASTY HURRICANE, I THINK WE HAVE A FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND NORTH CAROLINIANS WITHOUT POWER, BUT IN OUR CIRCLE, THIS IS A GREAT DAY FOR AMERICA. IT'S A GREAT DAY FOR THE BRUNSON FAMILY. WE HAVE A BETTER RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS DAUGHTER, WHO JUST RECENTLY SAID TO ONE OF OUR COMMITTEE MEETINGS, I REMEMBER HER SHARING THOMAS SHANNON, THAT SHE WAS SO LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DAY THAT HER DADDY COULD WALK HER DOWN THE AISLE. BEING THE FATHER OF A 12-YEAR-OLD, THAT WAS A POWERFUL STATEMENT. THE FACT THAT THAT GETS TO HAPPEN NOW, IT'S BEEN A TEAM EFFORT. WE WORK HARD WITH OUR FINANCIAL TURKISH INSTITUTIONS THAT WERE ABLE TO GET U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVES AND BE ABLE, WORKING WITH THE WORLD BANK, REFUSED THE LOANS TO THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT. GREAT WORK THERE, GREAT WORK. BUT THE TRUTH CHAMPIONS IN THIS, YOU HAVE TO GET CREDIT TO VICE PRESIDENT PENCE AND PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO WERE THE HOME RUN HITTERS IN GETTING THIS DONE. Shannon: THEY HAVE BEEN RELENTLESS ABOUT THIS. WHEN PEOPLE SAY, WHAT DID YOU HAVE TO DO TO GET BRUNSON HOME CUSTOMER HEARS WITH THE PRESIDENT SAID. THERE WAS NO DEAL MADE. THERE WAS NO DEAL AT ALL. BUT, WE ARE VERY HAPPY TO HAVE HIM AND HAVE HIM IN GOOD SHAPE. I HEAR HE'S IN VERY GOOD SHAPE. Shannon: THAT'S GREAT NEWS. THE WHITE HOUSE ALSO GIVING YOU CREDIT AND MANY OF THE LAWMAKERS THAT YOU MENTIONED IN THEIR STATEMENT TODAY BUT ADDING THIS, "WE REMAIN DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONTINUED DETENTION OF OTHER UNITED STATES CITIZENS IN TURKEY AND AROUND THE WORLD AND HOPE FOR A RESOLUTION IN ALL THESE CASES IN A TRANSPARENT AND FAIR MANNER." GOOD NEWS FOR THE BRUNSON FAMILY, BUT NOT FOR THE FAMILIES OF OTHER DETAINEES, AS WELL. NO QUESTION. WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO BE RELENTLESS, BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO PAUSE AND APPLAUD THIS ADMINISTRATION FOR FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THEIR WORDS. A LOT OF PEOPLE, SPECIFICALLY IN THE EVANGELICAL COMMUNITY, HAVE BEEN ASKED, WHY WOULD YOU SUPPORT A PRESIDENT? AND WE CONTINUE TO SAY REALLY ONE EXAMPLE AFTER THE OTHER WHY WE PUT THE POLICY AHEAD OF THE PERSONALITY, AT TIMES. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HIM SAYING I'M GOING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, SPECIFICALLY AS A HUMANITARIAN. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE RELIGIOUS BRADYS AND THE INFRACTIONS WE SEE WORLDWIDE. HE IS LEADING ON THESE EFFORTS. Shannon: WE ARE ALMOST OUT OF TIME BUT I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE CASE OF JAMAL KHASHOGGI AND THE SAUDIS. WHERE DOES THIS GO FROM HERE? I THINK FIRST OF ALL, IF THERE IS SOMETHING THAT HAS GONE AWRY, WE THINK RIGHT NOW EARLY EVIDENCE IS SHOWING THERE HAS BEEN SOME FOUL PLAY HERE. WE DO HAVE TO ACT ON THAT BUT NOT TO THE PLACE WHERE WE BACK OFF AND ARMS DEAL AND LET THE SAUDIS GET INVOLVED WITH THE RUSSIANS OR THE CHINESE AND WORKING ON SOME OF THOSE ARMS. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE STAY INVOLVED AND KEEP THOSE
