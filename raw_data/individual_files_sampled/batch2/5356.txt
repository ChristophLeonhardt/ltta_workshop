Willie listen this I I know Washington I've been around it for a quarter of a century I understand that some congressmen some senators some members of the administration former members of administration you know they get paid by lobbyists to make good with the white house but I've never heard of anything like a $600,000 payment to a guy that knows nothing about mergers and there's nothing about acquisitions $600,000 to make this AT&T deal go through they admitted that yesterday to make the AT&T deal go through and my question is where did that money go through to because I highly doubt that Donald Trump would let it sit in Michael Cohen's account well and remember Donald Trump during the campaign had come out very strongly against the AT&T Time Warner merger so 18t had reason to be concerned when Donald Trump was elected probably didn't expect he was gonna be elected and were scrambling and remember Michael Cohen's not a lobbyist and when you say lobbyists get paid he's not a registered lobbyist and this was a payment to a guy they thought had the ear of Donald Trump and might be able to put his thumb on the scale and make this deal go through that didn't work out for them let's get into the details of the story Joe a new report says on the very first business day of the Trump administration the president's personal attorney Michael Cohen signed a contract with AT&T to receive $600,000 to consult on long-term planning as well as its pending merger with Time Warner which the Justice Department eventually sued the block last November documents obtained by The Washington Post show Cohen made the deal on January 23rd 2017 within three days of president Trump's inauguration and just four days after Cohen publicly announced he would represent Trump as president and was resigned from the Trump administration the organization to avoid a quote perceived conflict AT&T says it paid Cohen for insights but the Post found it unclear what inside Cohen a longtime real estate attorney and former taxi cab operator could have provided AT&T on complex telecom matters meanwhile the health care news site stat reports that the 1.2 million dollars Novartis paid Cohen's company is almost four times more four times more than it paid any actual outside lobbyists in the same period of time a Novartis spokesman responded that Cohen was a hired consultant and not a lobbyist and that the consulting fees were in line with market terms for consultancy and advisory Joe yeah lot's of luck on that proving that to your shareholders John Heilemann everything just seems to keep exploding out there surrounding we have more stories coming out every day about Michael Cohen more stories coming out every day about payoffs to Michael Cohen Michael avenatti releasing letters releasing emails and I mean my question my question is first of all where do you think all of this is coming from all the information is coming from and secondly how impactful is going to be that $600,000 payoff to Michael Cohen and whoever Michael Cohen went ahead and passed the money through and how does that impact AT&T in the merger a lot of questions there the first thing I'd say Tan's to the question of where it's coming from Joe I don't know the answer but I'll say this having spent some time with Michael avenatti on the circus both a couple episodes ago and and a lot of time this week one of the things that you just as a as a basic human observation you walk around New York City Washington DC Los Angeles with the guy and he is being treated by a fair segment of the public as a hero he's got become a celebrity and and in the same way that you've seen Bob Muller been rated by the half of the country that wants to see Donald Trump thrown out of office you now have a popular view that this guy is like Bob Muller kind of their hope for changing the course of the country when you get that kind of popular support where there's people out there rooting for you you become a television celebrity and you're seen as a political figure you start to get information from a lot of different sources people start to want to feed you stuff some of its bunk some of it might not be bunk and I think he's right now with his ferm inundated with people who are sending him tips leads documents all kinds of things again I don't know what any of those sources are but I do know that there's a lot there's a groundswell of people out there who now see him as a vehicle and see him as a repository for stuff so that's one thing the second thing is I I think that this the notion that that Michel Cohen's LLC this LLC essential consulting basically looks like a giant slush fund for influence-peddling some of it from foreign sources some of it from domestic sources some of the corporate some of the other there's a big story here and and we're all interested in the sources of them of the money but the larger questions now are going to be in there things that reporters are gonna chase now for days and weeks to come is what did that money gets spent on you raise this in your opening thing in your opening statement you know the question of how was it used who got the payments that is gonna be a fruitful line of inquiry for journalists and investigators going forward and as to the ATT thing I will say I just think you know that there is i I don't want to be naive about this one point which is big companies in America buy influence in American politics I don't like that but we have a system of organized bribery corruption in this country that that lives in Washington DC that has to do with PACs and lobbyists and everything else and there were a lot of companies that were scrambling around with their hair on fire when Donald Trump got elected trying to figure out how do we get to this guy how do we influence this guy because the normal ways of doing it aren't going to work because he doesn't have those connections and so a lot of them in their desperation turn to Michael Cohen I'm not I'm not saying that that's good a good thing or making an excuse for it just as an anthropological explanation for what happened I do think that's what happened and clearly AT&T was one of those companies boy and it's it's an all mate like I said it happens but this is so much more than most lobbyists get yes and again Johnny the question is is that really money that stayed with Michael Cowan did it get through a slush fund you've known Michael for a very long time we've both known Trump I find it very hard to believe that Donald Trump would take take a meeting from anybody no I impossible to believe that Donald Trump would take a meeting from anybody as a favor to Michael Cohen knowing that Michael Cohen was going to make $600,000 off of him taking that meeting and you're sitting there laughing for the same reason you know if anybody don't know no it's just absolutely preposterous Donald Trump would not have allowed Michael Cohen to make $600,000 on his back because of an AT&T meeting yeah I spoke to Michael yesterday and Michael first of all said that basically these companies reached out to him this is according to Michael and and said look there's one thing about this guy this president and he says that just if you're a company doing it this is Michael if you're a company doing business with him is nobody knows how he's going to react nobody knows nobody understands the mind of Donald Trump his kids do and I probably am next in line and he believes that that's that's valuable at companies that's Michael's point of view whether that money was going to Trump well I can say is this and clearly I have no knowledge of that is that every time I think why would this guy who's worth a billion dollars II know I know he says 10 be getting involved in Trump University to get an extra hundred bucks in his pocket and therefore you go could this president possibly say wow maybe I can make an extra few hundred grand you know by getting these things you go that's not possible but then you go of course it's possible now clearly none of us know the answer to that Michael as I said he when I spoke to him yesterday he says I'm still gonna fighting moody he also pointed you know Corey Lewandowski has gotten two million dollars and whether we think it's sleazy or not it's certainly not against the law I think the two big questions still are did any of it go back to Trump and let us also not get ahead faked away from Russia because this still will always come back to the Russian money I think this is a bit of a sidebar in to hymens explanation this is one more demonstration of unfortunately the way Washington works and also I want to make a comment on Evan odd avenatti as we watch him I'm just feeling over the last few days a little bit he feels like he's jumping the shark a little bit we've all watched the media a bit and obviously he's done a lot of interesting things but if I'm managing Michael avenatti at this point I wouldn't be they are six hours a day at this point there's starting to be you starting to feel just as somebody who's in the media and watches the media a guy who's losing a little sight of where he is of the position he's in and you almost get the feeling he's already auditioning for Jeff Zucker and Phil Griffin for his next TV spot and if I was him if I was managing his brand a little bit I'm Donny Donny though he he's getting he's getting under Trump's skin Coran he's doing what Trump always does which is be everywhere all the time you're constantly in people's faces Fairplay and and and and he actually has gotten gotten in in in Trump's face but but going back to going back to your friend he's he mergers and acquisitions lawyer I mean does he know what do you think about his point would be once the I'm not defending it would be hey the valuable you know that I serve is you want to know how this guy not over the years I've had many conversation with them oh my god this is happening everybody thinks this Trump is gonna gonna say this and actually act this way so right theoretically what people would be paying for from his point of view as you know what when a B and C happens I'll tell you where the de NF is gonna happen based on spending twelve years inside the mind of this guy and nobody understands this guy better than his kids and information yeah and Willie Donny Donny brought up the question if Donald Trump has all these billions of dollars why is he risky his reputation on you know getting somebody to pay forty nine ninety five for Trump University I mean you can go down the list of things that just don't add up we've talked about it with Michael Cohen he's flippin thirty million dollar apartments and then he can't afford one hundred and thirty thousand dollar payoff for the president to a pornstar you could say the same thing about Donald Trump a lot of things that he does just doesn't they don't add up and yes this is a guy that would shake somebody down for a couple of hundred thousand dollars because we don't know just how cash-poor he is we we don't know if he's even a billionaire and that's why it'll be so interesting to see where this four point four million dollars that flowed through essential consultants actually ended up did it all really just go in Michael Cohen's pocket or words there some deal with the president will continue to look into that if you look at the numbers those susan they're not insignificant The Washington Post reports that the $600,000 AT&T paid Cohen represented three and a half percent of their entire lobbying budget for the year that's a lot of money to give to a guy who has no relationship to telecommunications or mergers and acquisitions but was seen as we were saying earlier as one of the few people in the chaos after President Trump was elected who might have the president's ear but we're looking at this from the window of he can do something positive for these companies there's a lot of talk right now that perhaps he was able to say you don't want me against you you don't want you want me on your side because I'll go to your competitor or an AT&T you don't I speaks of Donald Trump you don't want me whispering in his ear something negative I think of course he doesn't know about mergers and acquisitions he doesn't know about accounting he doesn't know about health care what was his purpose - maybe interpret some of Donald Trump's you know ideas and then also I'm probably more important to make sure that he didn't say hey I can keep you out of trouble or I won't go to your competitor and I think it's more of a shakedown than performing services yeah look we obviously don't know exactly what happened there but I agree with what everybody said before I mean first this is the swamp in action yes now this is how Washington works on steroids where normal lobbying normal kind of pay off some now but escalated into paying huge sums of money to guy who knows nothing except he happens to know the president United States but here's another point not to repeat what everybody else said that I think this is gonna be very interesting from Mahler because the question here is whether what Cohn did or whether all of it was legal did he pay his taxes on this money should have registered as a lobbyist depending upon what he actually did or didn't do and I suspect in all of Michael cones complicated dealings which every day we find out are more complicated Muller is gonna find grist for his investigation and other things he can do to put Leverett and have leverage against Cohn maybe flip him or at least go after him and so I think this is all going to relate back to the bigger picture of what Muller is doing he's evading trouble hey Donny let me ask you I just want to go a question I asked her before did we didn't really put a bow on it you've known Michael Cohen for a very long time you know you know how badly Donald Trump treats him you know that he makes fun of him he mocks him he ridicules him he doesn't think much of him personally and again we also know how cheap Donald Trump is how this is a guy who's been billions in debt and we don't even know if you know we don't know guy has any money at all so do you really believe knowing that relationship knowing Michael Cohen knowing Donald Trump as you have that Donald Trump would say to Michael Cohen oh cool yeah I'll sit with AT&T or I'll sit with these other companies you make gaffe at you make F a million dollars and I'll just sit here and do nothing or do you think that the Donald Trump wanted to cut of that just like he was going crazy during the debate season demanding he was actually thinking about demanding that CNN MSNBC and Fox pay him to go on the debate stage that he needed royalty checks because they were making so much advertising off of him do you think that Donald Trump ago oh it's great Michael yeah you make $600,000 not take some meetings for you I think personal the relationship with Michael is he did have a warm up until this point it's a warm relations sure when you yell at him just like he yells his homeland security director in front of the cabinet but he was very close to Donald Trump it's still an employee but a very very close thing do I think if Donald Trump knew about this he would say to Michael this is my opinion hey Michael I want 80 percent of that and keep setting up those meetings absolutely I don't know if Donald Trump knew about it before or after but I clearly will if that was happening and Donald Trump either knew or was going to know that would end up in Donald Trump's pocket once again there's a guy who sold no doubt about it so I could say though the complete certainty not knowing exactly what happened but yes that would go to Donald Trump and not only that Donald Trump would say to him hey by the way here are the fortune 500 companies let's go from 1 to 500 and I would take it up to a million dollars a pop was from the day Donald Trump got in office his attitude and we see it in his step his son in law's attitude is not how can I serve this country Wow you storm the gate this is really really cool ok that's done it just one tiny question justice to your point is that gonna go about the closeness and which is something that I perceived in them for a long time there's one thing that wrist fights that was that the disjuncture of Michael's apparent view that he would be White House chief of staff that's what he thought the relationship was like and not only was he not White House chief of staff but he got left behind him so what's just I'm not saying that a critical way I just asked the question of where was the mismatch there so between in their relationship that one of them thought I'm gonna go to Washington to be your most important person in the White House and the other one said you're not coming to Washington at all stay back in New York Michael's contention at this point is no he really didn't want to go he was in a position to do more outside of it that that's Michael's point of view I was surprised myself knowing their relationship that he didn't go there that Michael could have done with a lot of blocking and tackling mark Michael's got a lot of sharp elbows at the time I think he wanted somebody back at the store it's a little foggy what really went down there because it was about his close relationship other than his kids Michael sport at this point is he didn't really want to go on he was in position to do more in New York I wasn't there that's that's not true he he wanted to go Donald Trump said he was a bull in a china shop basically said he couldn't be trusted down there didn't want him anywhere around Michael was brokenhearted you've read The Wall Street Journal stories people overhearing him on the phone saying boss they miss you so much I mean it's very sad you can't read the support line bad for Michael Cohen he was run over by Donald Trump and thrown out because Donald Trump didn't think he was good enough to be in the White House I don't know the reason but I was surprised he was not there and I do think deep in Michaels heart he probably would have liked to have been there but wants to set once again what he said to me was no in hindsight I didn't I'm just just don't shoot the messenger all right we're gonna sneak in a break here Heidi Billa and Michael Schmidt coming up after the break still ahead on Morning Joe Rudy Guiliani has left his manhattan law firm to focus now on his work with
