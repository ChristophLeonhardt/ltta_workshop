hello I'm Kasim Zika this is counting the cost on al-jazeera your weekly look at the world of business and economics financial tremors in Turkey shake investor sentiment we'll take a look at whether it could be spreading across emerging markets also this week South Africa's ran takes a beating by a perfect storm of factors including land reform is heading Africa's most developed economy plus why Google is tracking your every move even when you tell it to stop but the collapse of the Turkish lira was a big worry for investors around the globe this week the currency crisis came to a head after a feud with the world's biggest economy the spat with the United States a longtime NATO ally isn't over yet on Wednesday turkey said it is putting retaliatory tariffs on imports of certain US products economists say Turkey central bank needs to raise interest rates significantly to strengthen its currency but that's something Turkey's president recep tayyip erdogan doesn't want to do in the meantime Qatar a strong ally of Turkey has placed fifteen billion dollars in direct investment in the country sinem castle has more from Istanbul Qatar Amir's visit to Turkey wasn't a random working visit it was right in the midst of the crisis of political tensions between United States and Turkey and it was also the time when the Turkish lira was losing value so it was important that he pledged his 15 billion worth foreign direct investment package and for now we don't know the details of this investment package but it was a sign for both Turkish domestic markets and the international markets that a huge a fund the Qatar has confidence in the Turkish markets of course Qatar has some more investments in Turkey at least worth 20 billion dollars of investments in May from media - entertainment construction infrastructure only the Turkey and Qatar has a strong economic operation and almost two years ago QNB Qatar National Bank acquired one of the biggest banks of Turkey Finance Bank and the Bank actually is planning to expand in the next couple of years more and it is one it is the biggest third loan lender in Turkey so Qatar already is a very important investor in Turkey even planning to expand more let's take a step back and talk about the turkey effect emerging market currencies from India to Argentina to Indonesia hit major lows why is this a Turkey's economy is relatively small it only accounts for about 1% of global gross domestic product to find the answer we have to go back nearly a decade ago after the end of the global financial crisis record low interest rates in the developed world meant it was cheaper for developing nations to borrow in dollars or Euros about 40 trillion dollars was added to the debts of emerging markets since then that's according to the Institute of International Finance but we are now entering an era in which central banks like the US Federal Reserve aren't keeping rates low anymore and that's lending support to the dollar so as the dollar Rises it is now costing those developing countries a lot more to repay their debts well joining us now from London is Timothy ash a senior emerging markets sovereign strategist with london-based Blue Bay Asset Management thanks very much for being with us so things look to have stabilized for now and the financial boost from Qatar is is a big help but what if what effect will this have is Turkey out of the woods yet the central bank which has been very inactive in the period since July 24th when they failed to raise rates which were really was a spur for the the big pressure on the layer that we've seen in recent weeks central bank really you know began to fight I mean it showed the g√ºnther tight and liquidity both onshore and offshore we have the good news about the Qatari support which is positive they could have come out of Monday with an announcement of capital controls they probably thought about it and thought this is not really a very good idea this is not going to help it's not going to help Turkish business and that's that's a positive they they still face big challenges the economy is still overheating there's a big pressure from inflation policy credibility is pretty low still and they have the problems still with the relationship with the US that really does need resolving and it seems to be part of a worldwide trend with emerging markets Argentina's having problems Indonesia South Africa the list goes on what do you think's going on there well you know I guess we came into the year with with the expectation of a Fed policy tightening we saw some policy errors in Argentina and obviously then in Turkey and and you know a combination of individual country stories that have been quite challenging Plus fed tightening and then obviously a difficult geopolitical backdrop with with Trump on trade obviously problems with China you know that's made people you know somewhat nervous around eeehm the positives I think is that you know e/m currencies have adjusted you know the times when when emerging market run ran fixed exchange rates is pretty much over in terms of big liquid markets currencies have adjusted that will help them you know if global growth slows and trade slows as well generally policymakers have been pretty or thoughts in terms of policy responses I mean turkey would be the exception but generally policy makers of hiked rates and so far oil has held in pretty well and remember a large part of the air mass at classes really oil and commodities metals are not a struggling at the moment that is a challenge but I was doing ok how big a problem is debt in all of this then clearly the positive about FX adjustments in emerging markets that helps the real economy but big for an exchange moves then you know puts the spotlight on countries with a lot of gross external debt foreign debt the the encouraging factor is so far we haven't seen any major emerging market go down a debt restructuring default scenario been a lot of pressure on Turkey but they survived so far willingness to pay is pretty high they have options as you know as noted earlier in terms of the Qatari support so countries are riding through it so far but you know it really does depend on you know if if we see a further deterioration in us-china trade relations global growth begins to suffer global obviously on the back of trade you know trade tightening and then oil and commodities take a step lower I think that would change the whole outlook for emerging markets more fundamentally and when you look when you look at Turkey particularly those that trades a great deal with the country and have large investments in it how exposed are they to Turkey's problems do you think well in terms of contagion you know turkey is a big trading partner of many countries if you look at you know it's it's it's quite interesting but everyone has spoken about a reorientation East given the challenges in terms of the u.s. relationship and and the Qatari support is useful but in the end two-thirds of turkeys trade investment in financing is from the West so whatever everyone may say about this reorientation it's really important to normalize the relationship with the West because ultimately you know what happens in Turkey will be determined about his ability to encourage you know international banks mostly Western and international institutional investors portfolio investors that to keep their money in Turkey and and you know you know I again it's really important I think that that relationship with the u.s. is normalized as soon as possible all right Timothy ash thanks very much for being with us my pleasure all right still to come on counting the cost a 300 year old Spanish ship is found off the coast of Colombia but who gets all its sunken treasure is the big question but first an Associated Press investigation this week revealed that Google is tracking your mobile phone even when the location setting is turned off companies like Google make billions of dollars from selling information about our every move to advertisers data like our exact location Google did not deny it was tracking users movements it said it provides clear descriptions of its tools to consumers Argentina already had the highest interest rates in the world and it's decided to hike them even higher on Monday it raised interest rates by 5 percent to a record 45 percent the central bank is trying to combat a currency sell-off concerns over a local corruption scandal and this week's turmoil in emerging markets set off the latest drop the lack of women in key senior corporate roles at the UK's largest public companies was highlighted this week a report released Wednesday showed just seven footsie 100 CEOs are women the report pointed out the ceos of the largest London listed companies are as likely to be named Dave as they are to be female a South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa is staking his reputation on trying to revive the economy ahead of next year's national elections but last week's plan to overhaul how land is owned in the country has alarmed some investors although apartheid ended almost 25 years ago South African society remains one of the most unequal in the world and it's made matters like land rights a burning issue for me the Miller has more from stellenbosch slivers of light shine through the simply furnished home of NOK Wanda Sacco Donna she's been living on this land illegally for three weeks they are dozens more roughly built homes dotted across this hill and still and wash near Cape Town an area known for its affluent vineyards and estates will may do it it's because of our government that we are here we have asked for land before but they have not helped us we have to make a lot of noise and fight to get this land here a court has ordered that no more homes can be Bulger and those that are unoccupied be destroyed but as night falls people scurry to bring in more building material this is our land that was taken from our ancestors even though the current owner bought this land the previous owners stole this land and so now it needs to be returned to us according to government statistics of Africa's whites minority population owns more than 70% of privately owned farming land and a political and public pressure to reform land ownership ruling African National Congress says it will support moves to change the Constitution to allow the seizure of land as long as it does not harm the agricultural sector or the economy but it's unclear how this will be done and who qualify for the land while acknowledging the need for urgent land reform President Salama posa appears to be struggling with a balancing act this week while addressing investors he said the government would not allow land grabs and anarchy wanting to calm the fears of the business community but deciding between what landis people need and what investors want may not make everyone happy the government says it plans to seize a hundred and thirty-nine farms across South Africa before the Constitution is changed if successful amendments to the Constitution could be avoided there are fears seizing land without compensation could scare off investors violate property rights and hurt food production critics say talk around land expropriation is a ploy for votes ahead of next year's elections rather than a sincere attempt to reform land ownership and that expectations should be managed meanwhile people here could face eviction as the land owner returns to court in the coming weeks to have them removed well joining me now from London is John ash born a senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics thanks very much for being with us so this sell-off in emerging markets couldn't have come at a worse time could it for South Africa with all the other problems that is dealing with it certainly is a difficult time for South Africa and coming after appeared when there was such optimism they had the change in president obviously in February and there was a hope that this word would put a difficult period behind the country and that doesn't seem to have happened and why do you think that is there's a realization I think now that many of the problems faced by South Africa are serious structural issues and it's going to take more than just a new president to address them even if present Ramaphosa is making some positive steps in some directions particularly in personnel changes at state enterprises it isn't possible in only a few months to turn things around and so that has led to I think a bit more of an understanding of the situation faced in South Africa and then of course this recent fall in the rand has been due to something entirely unrelated to South Africa a situation in Turkey because well even if South Africa is is improving it's still vulnerable to problems elsewhere in the world and what implications does this land reform plan have for South Africa's economy how is it being viewed there is is there a fear that it could we could end up with the chaos that Zimbabwe went through several years ago I think this in baboy is probably more than a worst-case scenario I think things getting that far it is very very unlikely what what's going on right now though is significant a significant amount of indecision and of lack of clarity it simply isn't known right now exactly what the government's plan will be there have been leaks suggestions of different bits of land being taken or not and so right now people honestly don't know what's going to happen and that's led to a great deal of of worry in the markets our our review and I think the view of many analysts is that at the end of the day the ANC isn't going to go crazy they aren't going to do the sort of thing that happened in Zimbabwe they know what the result of that would be and so we'll probably see some kind of compromise and a slow legalistic process they're talking about changing the constitution there'll be debates in Parliament there'll be new laws where excessive that goes isn't exactly clear but probably a series of small steps and and it is also worth keeping in mind that agriculture is only about 2% of the economy of South Africa so while this makes huge headlines and it's very emotive rightly for a lot of people this isn't going to be what the direction of South African economy what's much more important in that countries what's happening in mining what's happening and manufacturing what's happening in the retail sector generally and where does South Africa fit globally in terms of what's happening across emerging markets in the world right now well though it's been a very bad week for a difficult week we could say for emerging markets generally and so that furka has been one of the most affected by that and and some of that is because Africa has some domestic fragility is it has problems with its its current account deficit and so on but part of it is it's Africa because it's an accessible market and easily tradable currency it's always more affected by by factors going on in the global economy than other less integrated economies so if you look at another African country like like Kenya or like Nigeria they just don't have the sort of financial connections to the rest of the world that allow them to be harmed by crises that are happening in Europe or in Asia so South Africa is in some ways a victim of its success because it's a more integrated more globalized economy it therefore feels the harm of that when you see investors as they have been doing this past week pull out of emerging markets become scared by what's happening in Turkey and elsewhere so South Africa is in this case the victim of bad luck this isn't really a problem of their own creation but because of the way their economy works they've been much more hard-hit by that than have economies elsewhere and how our foreign investors in South Africa or potential foreign investors likely to view this whole issue of land reform and the lack of clarity around it right now well the lack of clarity is certainly bad for investment people don't really know what's going to happen and they don't know as well what the end of this process will be so the Constitution refers to the confiscation of property and and currently were only discussing agricultural land that's where the debates happened but if the law has changed could the same laws be used or applied to mines or to other industrial assets it's really not clear so I think when we do actually get a draft of a constitutional change then there'll be some clarity and we expect that that draft change will be relatively incremental and that will cause people to calm down of course if the change is more than what people think then we'll see another big drop in confidence and and more worries but right now I think many investors in Africa at least is worried about the economy generally I mean we had the the economy contracting in q1 and the numbers we have suggests that things were pretty much flat at best in q2 so this is an economy that might be in a technical recession that's having significant issues and concerns about corruption there are a lot of things to worry about even before we get to the land issue so it's only adding to that which is which is worrying people there is also this sovereign wealth fund proposal that the government is talking about yeah and given the problems that you've just highlighted there what are the prospects for that well there isn't there isn't to be frank much sovereign wealth to put into any kind of fund they put together so it would be a limited effect but at the moment there are several different funds and different ways that the government sort of marshals its assets and consolidating them into one even if it wouldn't be very big by the scale of a cut our countries like that is still probably administered step but I really doubt it will be a big enough for sort of strategic enough to have a significant effect on the economy even though it's an economy that that does need investments that frige doesn't have the kind of revenue or the kind of stored up wealth to create one of these huge funds in the way that you see in in the Middle Eastern countries or in places like Singapore good to speak with you John Ashbourne now there have been allegations of fraud on a Kenyan infrastructure project that was welcomed with fanfare just a year ago the railway which was funded by China connects the capital Nairobi with the port city of Mombasa Katherine Sawy has details this is the latest corruption case involving the construction of a railway line in Kenya the biggest and most expensive infrastructure project in the country at the moment the heads of the National Land Commission the state railway and other business people have pleaded not guilty to 19 charges including fraud corruption and abuse of office they're accused of authorizing payments for compensation of land used in the construction of a section of the railway about three million dollars paid to people or for land that did not exist or that was already owned by the released corporation this year the government has intensified its crackdown on corruption in a way Kenyans have not seen in a long no matter how powerful you think you are no matter how much you think you know people in high position no matter how much money you have that will not save you corruption has been a major concern multi-million dollar scandals have been unearthed in several public offices government officials politicians and powerful business people have been implicated some have been brought to court a report by the Auditor General's Office shows that a third of the country's budget is lost to corruption and mismanagement every year part of why I'm optimistic is that for the first time it's not just the job of the Director of Public Prosecutions or the anti-corruption Commission it's a multi-agency so we're going at this with everything that we have and in the spirit of the crackdown demolitions of buildings on broad reserves and riparian land say to have been acquired fortunately is ongoing so this is one of the buildings worth millions of dollars that have been brought down by the government in the last few weeks it sits right next to an important stream the next one to go is offshore center there the owners have already started bringing down the packs that are earmarked for demolition this is president were looking at his last time in office and his promised more jobs through the manufacturing industry universal health care affordable housing and food security for that to happen he needs to do decisively with corruption I think he understands that this is the only chance that he has to basically break away from the past which is basically I break the law but I have friends in high places that make a phone call and it's just gonna go away many Kenyans say they're happy with what they're seeing there however also calling for speedy trials convictions and the assets of those found guilty to be confiscated Oh finally Colombia's government is blocking treasure hunters from salvaging what they're calling the holy grail of shipwrecks when the spanish san jose galleons sank more than 300 years ago it was thought to be filled with gold and precious stones cargo that we worth billions today but it's manuel Rapallo reports it is unclear who will get the treasure once it's brought ashore stories of shipwrecks and sunken treasure have long captivated the imagination but perhaps no wreck has fascinated underwater archeologists and treasure hunters quite like the Sun will say attacked by Britain's Royal Navy in 1708 during a battle off the coast of got the Hanna Colombia all but seven members of her crew went down with the ship unfortunately the San Jose was too heavy to maneuver itself against the attack and was sunk by the British three years ago former Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos announced his government had found the fabled galleon with the aid of unmanned submersibles 3d mapping technology state-of-the-art robotics and an international team of experts the San Jose was found the catches a company called sea search Armada claimed they had found the ship more than 35 years ago and have been locked in a fierce legal battle with the Colombian government over their share of the treasure a treasure that today is valued up to 20 billion dollars though in money 50 Carragher it had everything the cargo manifest lists gold silver precious stones pearls all of the wealth and taxes collected over six years from Colombia Panama and Bruno somebody literally wrote the book on the San Jose he says there were several parties who have a legitimate claim to ownership over the treasure Espanyol the Spain because it was a Spanish ship Peru because most of the cargo was Peruvian Panama because part of the cargo was Panamanian and Colombia because the ship was found in our waters it's believed there are more than 1,000 sunken Spanish galleons off the coast of Colombia alone according to UNESCO there's an estimated three million shipwrecks all around the world still waiting to be discovered apart from the treasure the cultural value of many of these vessels is immeasurable Antonio de and - an expert in maritime law says the case of the San Jose could set a precedent for future disputes over sunken treasure kept all of resemble all of the countries involved could set up an example of a historic cultural dialogue that would serve the world in similar situations with so much at stake over the ownership of the treasure recovery efforts have been put on hold indefinitely leaving some here to wonder how much longer they'll have to wait before the treasure of the san jose surfaces again and that is our show for this week remember you can get in touch with us by tweeting me at handsome seeker do use the hashtag a JCTC when you do or drop us
