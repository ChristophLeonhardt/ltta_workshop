TIMES, WE'RE GOING TO CHARGE
FIVE TIMES.
THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE.
NO OTHER PRESIDENT BROUGHT IT UP
AND IT'S GOING TO BE DONE NOW.
>> Neil: ALL RIGHT.
TODAY'S D-DAY TO MAKE SURE IT
HAPPENS.
THE PRESIDENT REIMPLEMENTING
TARIFFS ON STEEL COMING IN FROM
FOREIGN COUNTRIES.
IT WORKS OUT TO ABOUT 10% ON
ALUMINUM RELATED PRODUCTS.
IT GOES AFTER THE MEXICANS, THE
CANADIANS, THE EUROPEANS, ALL OF
WHOM SAYING THEY WILL RESPOND IN
KIND.
MEXICO PROMISED TO TARGET A
LIGHT NUMBER OF U.S. GOODS
EQUALLING THE SAME AMOUNT.
THAT WOULD INCLUDE EVERYTHING
FROM GRAPES AND BERRIES AND PORK
CHOPS, CHEESE PRODUCTS, COLD
CUTS.
THE CANADIANS SAID THEY WILL
ADDRESS EVERYTHING FROM STEEL
AND ALUMINUM TO WHISKEY AND
ORANGE JUICE THAT MAKES ITS WAY
TO THEIR COUNTRY.
SO WHAT IS GOING ON?
DAN SIMMONS, THE UNITED STEEL
WORKER'S LOCAL.
THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME.
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.
IT'S A MESS AND IT IS SOMETHING
THAT WE ALL NEED TO BE
DISCUSSING.
THIS IS WHAT IS DIFFICULT, NEIL.
IT'S KIND OF A BITTER SWEET.
WE'VE BEEN PUSHING AND
ADVOCATING FOR SOME ASSISTANCE,
GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE FOR QUITE
SOME TIME.
SPECIFICALLY TO OUR BAD TRADE
PARTNERS THAT HAVE BEEN
ILLEGALLY DUMPING AND HARMING
OUR STEEL AND ALUMINUM FOR MANY
YEARS.
I'VE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR TEN
YEARS PLUS.
WE'VE BEEN FALLING ON DEAF EARS.
NOW WE PUSHED HARD ENOUGH AND
LOBBIED HARD ENOUGH TO GET THESE
INVESTIGATIONS STARTED.
THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT DID IN
FACT FIND HARM TO THE DEGREE OF
VERY STIFF DEGREES TO IMPOSE THE
25% AND 10% ON THE ALUMINUM.
THE PROBLEM IS, IT'S A BROAD
BRUSH.
WE HAVE MANY COUNTRIES THAT ARE
BAD TRADE PARTNERS, BUT WE HAVE
EQUALLY GOOD TRADE PARTNERS.
YOU KNOW, THE CANADA, OUR
SISTERS AND BROTHERS.
THEY'RE PART OF THE USW WITH US.
>> Neil: SO THE FACT THAT
THERE'S SO MANY OF YOUR CANADIAN
COLLEAGUES PART OF THIS AND
THEY'RE GETTING HURT BY THIS, SO
YOU GUYS ALMOST HAD NO CHOICE
BUT TO REJECT THIS.
BUT IT IS HELPING JOBS FOR STEEL
WORKERS.
YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THAT?
>> IT SHOULD EQUATE TO SOME JOBS
CREATION SPECIFICALLY HERE IN
THE DOMESTIC MARKETS OBVIOUSLY.
IT'S GOING TO OPEN UP
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE STEEL
INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES
AND ALONG WITH ALUMINUM.
YES, SHOULD EQUATE TO THAT.
OBVIOUSLY IT'S EARLY ON.
YEAH, I SEE NO OTHER WAY AND
SHOULD EQUATE TO SOME JOB
CREATION AND SOME PRICING ALONG
WITH SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS.
>> Neil: AND THE TARIFFS, THE
THOUGHT WAS COOLER HEADS WOULD
PREVAIL AND THIS IS A WAY TO
NEGOTIATE AND GET PEOPLE TO THE
TABLE.
THE POINT AT WHICH THAT DOESN'T
HAPPEN, OF COURSE.
THE THINGS YOU DIDN'T PLAN ON
ULTIMATELY HAPPEN.
WHERE DO YOU THINK THIS GOES?
>> I AGREE WITH YOU THERE.
ALREADY WE'VE SEEN WHERE THE
LEVERAGE HE'S HAD WITH THE --
GIVING THEM THE EXEMPTIONS
TEMPORARILY.
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO RENEGOTIATE
SOME TRADE DEALS WITH KOREA,
WHICH THAT WAS A BAD TRADE
PARTNER.
NOW THEY LOCKED IN AND WORKED
OUT SOME DETAILS.
MY GUT FEELING IS JUST WHAT YOU
SAID.
THIS SHOULD FORCE PEOPLE TO LOOK
AT LEVELLING THE PLAYING FIELD.
THAT'S ALL WE'VE CRIED FOR FOR
YEARS AND LOBBIED HARD.
WE HAVE OLD TRADE LAWS IN THIS
COUNTRY, IN THE UNITED STATES.
WE'RE ASKING TO ENFORCE THE
TRADE LAWS ON THE BOOKS.
REWRITE WOULD BE GREAT.
MODERNIZE THEM, GREAT.
JUST GIVE US A LEVEL PLAYING
FIELD WE CAN COMPETE AGAINST
ANYBODY.
THE CHEATERS THAT ARE THE ONES
