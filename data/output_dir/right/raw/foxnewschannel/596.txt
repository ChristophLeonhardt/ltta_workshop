THERE'S MANY OTHERS.

44
00:01:53,278 --> 00:01:56,113
I COULD JUST KEEP GOING ON AND

45
00:01:56,114 --> 00:01:56,380
ON.

46
00:01:56,381 --> 00:01:58,415

WE'RE GOING TO KEEP IT GOING

54
00:02:17,168 --> 00:02:19,970

I HAVE EARNED YOUR VOTE FOR A

67
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:51,135
SECOND TIME.

68
00:02:51,136 --> 00:02:53,137
DANNY O'CONNOR RAN A HARD RACE.

69
00:02:53,138 --> 00:02:54,505
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO

70
00:02:54,506 --> 00:02:56,807
CAMPAIGNING AGAINST HIM AGAIN

71
00:02:56,808 --> 00:02:57,975
THIS FALL.

78
00:03:13,124 --> 00:03:13,424
THERE.

79
00:03:13,425 --> 00:03:16,326
IT APPEARS IT HAS BEEN A

80
00:03:16,327 --> 00:03:17,528
SQUEAKER OF A WIN.

81
00:03:17,529 --> 00:03:19,129
STILL TOO CLOSE TO CALL.

82
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,432
WE'RE TOLD THERE'S SOME

83
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:22,766
PROVISIONAL BALLOTS THAT NEED TO

84
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:23,634
COME IN.

85
00:03:23,635 --> 00:03:25,736
HE'S CLAIMING VICTORY, THOUGH.

86
00:03:25,737 --> 00:03:26,470
HEY, ED.

87
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:28,505
>>  SHANNON, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

88
00:03:28,506 --> 00:03:31,608
THE RNC HAS JUST PUT OUT A

89
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:34,978
STATEMENT BASICALLY DECLARING

90
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:35,312
VICTORY.

91
00:03:35,313 --> 00:03:36,213
THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL

92
00:03:36,214 --> 00:03:37,648
COMMITTEE SAYING, THIS IS PROOF

93
00:03:37,649 --> 00:03:40,484
THAT THE SO-CALLED BLUE WAVE IS

94
00:03:40,485 --> 00:03:43,120
JUST A RIPPLE.

95
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:44,888
THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

96
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:46,957
EVERYTHING IS COUNTED AND

97
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,493
THEY'VE GOT ALL THE PROVISIONAL

98
00:03:49,494 --> 00:03:49,827
BALLOTS.

99
00:03:53,932 --> 00:03:57,468
JUST SAW, IS WINNING BY 1,754

100
00:03:57,469 --> 00:03:57,935
VOTES.

101
00:03:57,936 --> 00:03:59,870
THAT IS A WIDER MARGIN THAN WE

102
00:03:59,871 --> 00:04:02,372
HAD SEEN JUST AN HOUR OR SO AGO.

103
00:04:02,373 --> 00:04:04,341
AT ONE POINT THESE TWO

104
00:04:04,342 --> 00:04:06,710
CANDIDATES, DANNY O'CONNOR, THE

105
00:04:06,711 --> 00:04:08,712
DEMOCRAT, AND TROY BALDERSON THE

106
00:04:08,713 --> 00:04:10,914
REPUBLICAN, WERE SEPARATED BY

107
00:04:10,915 --> 00:04:12,249
155 VOTES.

108
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:17,187
SO A 1754-VOTE LEAD IS SORT OF

109
00:04:17,188 --> 00:04:19,690
MASSIVE FOR BALDERSON RIGHT NOW

110
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,858
IN THE CONTEXT OF HOW CLOSE THIS

111
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,227
RACE IS.

112
00:04:28,132 --> 00:04:32,202
THE GREEN PARTY GOT 1,127 VOTES.

113
00:04:32,203 --> 00:04:34,238
SO NOT ENOUGH TO TIP THE

114
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:35,873
BALLOTS, BUT WITHOUT THE GREEN

115
00:04:35,874 --> 00:04:36,907
PARTY CANDIDATES AND THOSE VOTES

116
00:04:36,908 --> 00:04:39,610
ON THE LEFT, THE DEMOCRAT

117
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:40,344
CANDIDATE O'CONNOR WOULD HAVE

118
00:04:40,345 --> 00:04:41,945
BEEN EVEN CLOSER.

119
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:43,614
SO THERE MIGHT BE SOME

120
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:44,815
FRUSTRATION ON THE DEMOCRATIC

121
00:04:44,816 --> 00:04:46,650
SIDE AS WELL WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

122
00:04:46,651 --> 00:04:47,684
SOCIALISTS AND OTHERS PULLING

123
00:04:47,685 --> 00:04:50,220
THE PARTY TO THE LEFT.

124
00:04:50,221 --> 00:04:51,788
THE GREEN PARTY CANDIDATE ENDED

125
00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:53,524
UP MAKING THIS KIND OF MORE

126
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:53,924
INTERESTING.

127
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:55,459
WITHOUT THE GREEN PARTY

128
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,793
CANDIDATE, THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN

129
00:05:01,132 --> 00:05:03,800
WITHIN THE MANDATORY RECOUNT

130
00:05:03,801 --> 00:05:06,503
MARGIN, WHICH IS .5.

131
00:05:06,504 --> 00:05:08,906
IF IT'S INSIDE THE MARGIN, THE

132
00:05:08,907 --> 00:05:10,240
STATE PAYS FOR IT.

133
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:11,775
BUT OUTSIDE OF THAT, THE LOSER

134
00:05:11,776 --> 00:05:12,910
WOULD HAVE TO PAY.

135
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:15,212
UNLESS IT TURNS OUT THEY WIN,

136
00:05:15,213 --> 00:05:18,248
THEN THEIR MONEY IS REFUNDED.

137
00:05:18,249 --> 00:05:20,150
>>  BY OUR CALCULATION, THAT

138
00:05:20,151 --> 00:05:22,185
PUTS BALDERSON THE REPUBLICAN UP

139
00:05:22,186 --> 00:05:23,754
BY .9 PERCENTAGE POINTS.

140
00:05:23,755 --> 00:05:26,189
SO IT WOULD BE A BIGGER MARGIN

141
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,693
THAN THE SMALLER .5 PERCENTAGE

142
00:05:33,331 --> 00:05:36,700
BEEN IN HERE, THIS LIKELY WOULD

143
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:38,635
HAVE BEEN WITHIN THE .5

144
00:05:38,636 --> 00:05:39,536
PERCENTAGE NEEDING A RECOUNT.

145
00:05:39,537 --> 00:00:00,000
RIGHT NOW, BARRING WHATEVER
