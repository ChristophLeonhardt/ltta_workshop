00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,180
your questions and our answers our first

3
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,050
question from econ analyst is why is

4
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,779
voting not worthwhile but playing the

5
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:27,680
lottery is that answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really easy</font>

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,880
somebody wins when you play the lottery

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,790
when you vote nobody wins except a

8
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,820
crooked politician next question in

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,129
light<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the feds commitment to almost</font>

10
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:40,170
zero interest rates can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect</font>

11
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,410
mortgage rates to move down from here

12
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not but you're</font>

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,670
probably asking the wrong question you

14
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,620
don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to time the mortgage</font>

15
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,449
market to get the lowest interest rates

16
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:54,210
and possible what you want to do is buy

17
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,829
a house that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to live in and</font>

18
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,850
with a mortgage you can afford who is

19
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,829
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite economist living or dead</font>

20
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">and why the answer is obviously Jesus</font>

21
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:09,420
Christ I'll return to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i would say</font>

22
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,030
other than our<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lord and Savior the</font>

23
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,979
answer would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ludwig von Mises and</font>

24
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,170
Frederick Hayek I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that both of</font>

25
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,070
them opened new ground in economics and

26
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,840
formulated the answers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are most</font>

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,680
telling for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> current crisis would you</font>

28
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,820
have thought that it would take more

29
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">than 12 months for the business media to</font>

30
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,250
get over<font color="#CCCCCC"> a IG and to start cheering for</font>

31
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,829
insurance companies making all in wages

32
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:38,430
that's from our reader tin box well tin

33
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,299
box I'm still outraged about AIG and as

34
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,460
long as they still have piles of our

35
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,200
money which I<font color="#CCCCCC"> expect them to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

36
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,210
all of eternity I'll never get<font color="#CCCCCC"> over it</font>

37
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I hope the rest of the business</font>

38
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:53,549
media doesn't either next question from

39
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:59,219
bid<font color="#E5E5E5"> whacker CNBC or Bloomberg TV that's</font>

40
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,009
an easy answer to CNBC they invite me<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

41
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,540
all the time Bloomberg not so much from

42
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,598
Paul Krugman whose beard do you like

43
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,000
better Paul Krugman's or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ben Bernanke's</font>

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,580
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> Paul I'm glad you asked the best</font>

45
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,130
beard in economics is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charles beard the</font>

46
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:24,050
US economic historian are you got this

47
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,630
question comes from Matt Damon Matt I'm

48
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,239
glad you're watching are you guys at all

49
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:31,010
concerned with helping the average

50
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">American process and understand what's</font>

51
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:35,569
going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> around them to not get their</font>

52
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:38,540
home foreclosed on or go bankrupt or are

53
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,250
you just trying to get as much traffic

54
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,800
as possible that's a trick question Matt

55
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,280
of course we want to inform<font color="#E5E5E5"> people and</font>

56
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,440
let them<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what they need to do to</font>

57
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,680
remain prosperous but we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best</font>

58
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,060
way for them to do that is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> visit our</font>

59
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">site as much as possible so they go hand</font>

60
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,470
in hand finally our final question is

61
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,780
what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think is a greater threat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

62
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,420
the country werewolves or the zombie

63
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,569
apocalypse from client number nine well

64
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:10,549
client<font color="#CCCCCC"> nine that's also a trick question</font>

65
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:13,580
very clearly the true threat to our

66
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">republic is the Anunnaki the reptilian</font>

67
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,930
