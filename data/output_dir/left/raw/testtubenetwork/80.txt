00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:05,380
In the aftermath of the Soviet Union, the
newly formed Russian Federation had a problem.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:10,869
Since the late 1940s, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization stood as a military alliance

3
00:00:10,869 --> 00:00:15,690
among the most powerful countries on earth,
to oppose the USSR’s enormous reach.

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:22,119
But in the early 1990s, without control over
its former Soviet Empire, Russia seemed relatively

5
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:23,259
defenseless.

6
00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:25,410
And so did it’s Eurasian neighbors.

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,960
This predicament sparked a NATO-like association
of post-Soviet states, called the Collective

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,990
Security Treaty Organization, and from reading
our comments lately, it seems like you want

9
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:33,990
to know more about this military group.

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,070
So, just how powerful is Russia’s largest
military alliance, and how does it fare against

11
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,070
NATO?

12
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:44,780
Well, the CSTO was formed in May of 1992,
barely six months after the collapse of the

13
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,440
Soviet Union.

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:53,610
This Russia led organization included Armenia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan,

15
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,990
all formerly Soviet entities.

16
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:01,680
Within a few years, three more states joined,
Azerbaijan, Belarus, and Georgia.

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,820
Collectively these nine countries agreed to
work together militarily, and most importantly,

18
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,740
provide support and security.

19
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:14,760
The CSTO Charter clearly states that their
goals include “strengthening of peace, international

20
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,540
and regional security and stability, protection
of independence on a collective basis, territorial

21
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,580
integrity and sovereignty of the Member States”.

22
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,890
So, a formalized mutual defense treaty.

23
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:32,070
But while the CSTO was intended to serve as
a counterpoint to NATO, it has ultimately

24
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,510
fallen very short of its goal.

25
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:38,830
First of all, since its creation, the CSTO
has lost three member states, Azerbaijan,

26
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:44,600
Georgia, and Uzbekistan, all of whom have
distanced themselves from an increasingly

27
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,650
territorial Russia.

28
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,720
The remaining states, when pitted against
NATO seem mostly ineffective.

29
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,400
NATO accounts for more than half of the world’s
military spending, and contains all of the

30
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,962
most powerful militaries, besides Russia and
China.

31
00:01:56,962 --> 00:02:01,760
And while NATO has spent much of the 20th
century actually working together to aid member

32
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,040
states, the CSTO has failed in its comparatively
short lifetime.

33
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:13,079
In 2010, Kyrgyzstan saw ethnic violence rock
its borders, and called on the CSTO for help.

34
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:17,980
The organization head refused, saying that
it was a domestic matter and not covered by

35
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,980
their joint-agreement.

36
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:24,400
Then, two years later, Tajikistan asked for
help in resolving an autonomous dispute, which

37
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,170
involved rebel and military forces attacking
each other.

38
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,450
Again, the CSTO refused.

39
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,269
Perhaps most damningly, while a major function
of the CSTO is ostensibly to support Russian

40
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:40,000
influence in the region, the country’s most
controversial military incursion has been

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,969
soundly rejected by most member states.

42
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:48,730
Following the invasion of Crimea, all members
except Armenia criticized the violation of

43
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,209
Ukraine’s territorial integrity.

44
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:56,329
Most of the union also refused to vote in
favor of Russian policy regarding Syria at

45
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:57,590
the United Nations.

46
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:03,870
In short, while the CSTO may be a mutual defense
collective on paper, in practice not only

47
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,530
is the group devoid of power, but it also
works against advancing Russian policy in

48
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,879
multiple areas.

49
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:14,389
So, the CSTO isn’t quite the NATO alternative
it was meant to be.

50
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:16,980
But how effective and powerful is NATO anyway?

51
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,609
