why is God hid why does it appear that God is invisible why is he hidden from us that's a question that believers have been grappling with for millennia it's also a question that among atheist I think is probably considered the number one for many atheists it would seem it is considered the number one argument against the existence of God because they say that look an all-powerful being a being who is responsible for creating all things who rules over all things he would not remain invisible to us he would he would reveal himself unmistakably especially if he looks upon it and and and and you think well if I were God you know and I created this world of people and I looked and I saw this world and I saw especially the people were falling away and falling away from belief and there were so much suffering and misery and pain and so forth well then I would I would appear I would make myself clear I would say hey everybody listen up look here I am here's God here's what I want you to do here's how I want you to live I wouldn't pass down these truths in a in a you know in a book in an ancient book I wouldn't trust human few other humans to you know impart the knowledge I would just appear and I would make it clear I think that's kind of the atheist argument and I think even even non atheist even believers have had moments of wondering this I think we all probably have we've all we've all grappled with this question I know I've had I'll admit that I've had moments in prayer sometimes where I say to God I say God if you would just reveal yourself to me I mean can you just reveal yourself can you come out of the shadows just for one second and just show me your glory in all of its fullness just for one second that's all I'm asking for just one second just one second if I had just one second justjust a blink of an eye if I'd a one-second vision of heaven of the supernatural realm of the world that lies beyond this one if I had just that one second that would be enough to sustain me for the rest of my life I could live for a hundred years for a thousand years on just that one second but the vision never comes it's never come to me it's never come to most of us and I think for most of us it never will come at least not in this life why well I think that there are I'm going to offer three answers to that to that question and these are not not claiming that these are the three answers I'm just saying that these are three answers they may not even be the best answers but as I've thought about this this problem this is what I've concluded why is god first answer and the most obvious answer is that he isn't it at least not in the way and not to the extent that atheists would claim God has revealed himself to mankind countless times through the ages and as a Christian I would say of course that that the greatest and most definitive revelation came in the person of Jesus Christ Jesus was born he ministered on earth he performed miracles he was crucified he was resurrected and then he ascended and he was not hidden during that time and these events themselves were not hidden and since then and before that God has revealed himself in other ways to other people and there again have been countless stories of visions and supernatural events and miraculous unexplainable healings and so forth so all of these things and you can choose to disbelieve these signs and you can choose to disbelieve in God and you can choose to disbelieve in Jesus Christ and and and and all of that but but if you do you must admit that you are not disbelieving a hidden God because that is not the God that we believe in we believe in a God who has revealed himself repeatedly to the human race so we do not believe in an entirely hidden God second answer the hiddenness of God being so-called invisibility of God his is somewhat of a relative thing it's a matter of perception you might say because in the Middle Ages for instance God was seen as this utterly self-evident truth because a man of that time would look around himself and see God revealed in pretty much everything he would see the beauty of nature he would see you know he would look up at the sky and see the vastness of space he would see the mountains and trees and oceans he would look at his fellow man he would look within himself and see his own self and his own mind and his moral awareness and he could look at poetry and arts and listen to music and on and on and on and all of this to him was a clear indication of God's presence so if you had said to him where is God he would have looked back at you and he would have said what do you mean where is he he's all around you look around he's everywhere and I think that that was the correct perspective and when I have demanded in prayer at times and moments of weakness when I have demanded that God revealed himself to me I could imagine God making the same response to me and saying look around you I have revealed myself I'm everywhere third answer the last two answers were not entirely sufficient I think they're necessary but not sufficient because the Atheist will respond and say okay so you say that God was incarnate 2,000 years ago he revealed himself to a very small smattering of people who existed back then and okay so so God has allegedly performed miracles and all these wondrous signs for again a small fraction of people through the ages and okay so you say that the beauty of nature and all that stuff is supposed to indicate God's presence fine but all of that gives rise to another question if God exists and if he is willing to reveal himself through miracles and through curing the blind and through raising the dead and through even even through coming here and being raised himself from the dead then why doesn't he cut out the guesswork entirely why doesn't he just like appear to us in the sky as this immense beautiful heavenly figure and speak to us to all of us and say hi I'm God here's what I need you to do here here's here's the meaning of life here are the things that you need here's how you need to live let me lay it out for you he could make himself unmistakably unavoidably absolutely evident to everyone on earth but the fact is that he hasn't why now I think that's a reasonable objection because it's true that even though he's revealed himself to us as a Christian we must admit that he has chosen to reveal himself in a way that still allows us to deny his existence he seems to throw out these bread crumbs but he leaves room and probably a lot of room to ignore those crumbs and even to ignore him and his very existence he could appear to us in the sky he could do that he could appear to each of us individually at the same time he could appear he can appear right before you in your home I mean he could he could force you to believe he absolutely could I know there are people who would argue about - well yeah but even if God appeared in the sky I mean atheists would still find some other explanation for it and maybe a few of them would I mean the most the most but I think almost everybody would come to believe in God if he were to appear in the sky and stand speak to us right and he could reveal himself in a way individually to all of us where everybody in the world would believe he could force that upon us he could so if the whole point is to believe in nothing more than he could force that and and in fact one day he will force the issue one way or another one day we are we are all going to believe in God one day nobody in the afterlife no matter where they are heaven or hell none of them are atheists because when you when you stand before God in judgment there's not going to be any disbelieving there's not gonna be any way around it so why don't we get that sign now I think it's because believing in God's existence is not the point in and of itself the point is to love God love is the point to love God and to desire him alone that's the point of existence if the only point we're simply just to believe in God's existence well then this existence where we that we have now separated from God and where God is invisible seems like a cruel joke it seems like this weird game of like hide-and-seek that God is playing with us where he sends us off to some abandoned corner of the universe and then hides off somewhere somewhere on some other corner and says come and find me and oh the whole point of life is just to you know believe and nothing more but that's not the point of life the point is to love is to love God and to desire him and I would submit that for most of us right now on earth a miraculous revelation would hinder us it would prevent us from loving him it may force us to believe but it would prevent us from loving him if he were to appear in the clouds before all of us right now we would all believe but we would not all love and there are even some of us who maybe could have come to love him but now would not because he has appeared let me explain what I mean by that and I will use again as I've used many times the analogy of marriage and I do think this is the best analogy that we have available to us to explain our relationship with God and it is the analogy that analogy that God the Father and God the Son both make repeatedly in Scripture so I'm you know pretty confident in the analogy because it's the one that God Himself relies upon so so think about if you're a man think about when you first met the woman who would be your wife think about that moment when you first met your wife and you saw her and she was beautiful and she was full of life and energy and you were captivated you were enchanted you were infatuated right now oftentimes we'll call this falling in love and there are people who will say I fell in love with my wife it was love at first sight I fell in love instantly but really and after and when you get married you've been married a while and you have a little bit mature of maturity and and and you start to understand you realize that that wasn't love at all you didn't love your wife the moment that you saw her there was not love at first sight you didn't fall in love with her a second after laying your eyes on her you couldn't you didn't know her you had almost nothing to go on besides her her her looks which was really for being honest the main thing I mean in the first few seconds of meeting her in the first few moments in the first few days probably in the first few months one of the primary things attracting you to her was that she was beautiful and you had a pretty surface level understanding of her personality as well but that's it that's all you had yet her looks and you had what you knew of her personality which was not much because he didn't know her that well so no this wasn't love this couldn't be love it was captivation it was infatuation it was preoccupation maybe it was even obsession but it was an entirely emotional experience in order for true love to develop and for a lasting marriage to be formed these initial fireworks this emotional experience these emotional hysterics have to cool down and we you know we'll often call this the will say well the the in love phase is ending but actually the opposite is true that's such a it's such a stupid way of looking at it when that infatuation starts to cool in a marriage was out all the in love phases the exact opposite is true this is the now here's the part where they where it is actually possible to be in love the state of being really in love begins when that initial phase ends so it's precisely when the infatuation emotion and sexual attraction are no longer the number one driving forces in your relationship not to say that they're gone but when they are the driving forces well then you cannot really be in love because that's not love it's when those things kind of take a backseat to something else when something deeper something calmer something more real becomes the bond that ties you together at that moment that's when you can really love in other words there is really love there is really a Meritage when you get to the point where you're choosing the other you're choosing your wife willfully and not because you're almost forced to choose or because your emotional attraction to her is so strong think about the ridiculously intense quote relationships between like 15 year-olds in high school think about a 15 year old boy and girl they're dating and they're absolutely obsessed with each other for five months and then in the sixth month they hate each other but during that 5-month stretch they they had almost no choice but to be with each other because their attraction was so intense and so primal and so physical that they had almost no choice they were obsessed with each other there was no love there whatsoever no matter how much they said oh I love you love each other and even know each other this was just nothing but pure attraction and then when it started to wane just a little bit everything fell apart because there was no love there whatsoever how does this relate to God I'd say it relates in this way if God were to reveal himself to all of us right now in his glory he were to appear in the sky before all of us if he were to appear right now before you in your home if you were to do that for all of us we would all certainly fall at his feet and we would worship I think there's no question about that but at that point we would have no choice our emotions responding to this inconceivable event would force us to fall and cower before this immense all-powerful being it would be something like laying eyes on your spouse for the first time except magnified by a billion by a trillion magnified infinitely and just as that emotional infatuation actually prevented for a time true love from forming so to would love be prevented from forming as you look upon this beautiful terrifying awesome being now you would believe in this being certainly and I think you would fear him and you would in a sense worship him but if you didn't go into that meeting already loving him then how could you possibly love him now how could you think clearly enough to love him if you were too overwhelmed by the sight of your spouse to truly love them on sight would you not be a billion times a trillion times more overwhelmed by meeting God and thus would it not be a billion times a trillion times harder to begin loving him then and if the point of life is to love God and not merely to believe that he exists but if the point is to love him then would that purpose not be hindered even prevented by this spectacle that we're all asking for I would say that God's nature is such that that we Fallen human beings need a certain distance from him in order to love him because love is a noble thing it's a it's a it is a higher thing and it is a willful thing and if God were so to speak right on top of us revealing himself in his glory then the baser elements of human nature would inevitably take over fear self-preservation and so forth even even wonder and awe not that those things are based but they're not as high as love so all of that wonder or fear all of that would take over take over our mind and the the nobler calmer willful love would have no chance to develop within us so it makes sense then I think why God reveals himself in the way that he does with these kind of crumbs with these hints with little glimpses into a beauty and a reality beyond our own but still with that separation and with that distance even Jesus when he was on earth before the resurrection he only revealed himself and just for a moment in his full divine glory one time 2/3 of his as 2/3 of his disciples and only after they'd been following him for a time and only after Peter had already made his confession it's it's some important to note in the Bible that Peter makes his confession and says you are the son of God and then it's a few verses after that that the Transfiguration happens and I think it had to be that way that the Apostles had to come and follow him and loved him and recognized him before he could reveal himself in his glory and we will all see I think reality transfigured one day we're all going to see the truth inescapably but we have to go into that moment already loving God already desiring him or at least at least we have to go into it with a seed with a kind of sapling of love and desire we've got to have something there's got to be something there something that we have really chosen and something that we could have not chosen something that we had the option to to to deny if God appears before us well then belief really means nothing at all because we had no choice but to believe but there's got to be love and if we meet God having never loved him then in that moment I think logically if you understand human nature it's clear that in that moment it will be too late if you don't go into the meeting already loving him at least to some extent at least even to the smallest extent then it will be too late so so God keeps us here he keeps us in this reality and it calls us home when he knows that we're ready we he knows that our love has grown as much as it's going to grow and we're ready for the next stage final stage or alternatively our life can be over when he knows that we will never be ready when he knows that the love is never going to develop and the sapling is never going to grow and our cause is hopeless in which case were finished but either way we have the chance now because of that distance and because of that separation we have the chance to love him and we have to make that choice and it seems to me that he reveals himself as much as he possibly can while still giving us the opportunity to really love so that's just as I said one possible answer probably not the best one but it's the possible one something at least to think about thanks for watching thanks for listening everybody god speed
