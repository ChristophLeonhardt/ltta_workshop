that the journalists don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have all the</font>

really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting and it's a way the</font>

56
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,409
newspaper can really engage people in a

57
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:07,869
deeper way and you know not be as

00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:10,479
reliant on advertising support of that

59
