1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,790
“I am here because I
believe it is my civic duty. ...”

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,628
“This confirmation process has
become a national disgrace.”

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,550
“Early in the evening,

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,200
I went up a very
narrow set of stairs

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,220
leading from the living room
to a second floor

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,590
to use the restroom.

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,880
When I got to the
top of the stairs,

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,860
I was pushed from behind
into a bedroom

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,729
across from the bathroom.

10
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,700
I couldn’t see who pushed me.

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,950
Brett and Mark came
into the bedroom

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,310
and locked the door
behind them.

13
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,570
There was music
playing in the bedroom.

14
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,120
It was turned up louder
by either Brett or Mark

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,620
once we were in the room.

16
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,170
I was pushed onto the bed
and Brett got on top of me.

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,680
He began running his
hands over my body

18
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,530
and grinding into me.

19
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,330
I believed he was
going to rape me.

20
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,790
I tried to yell for help.

21
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,580
When I did, Brett put his
hand over my mouth

22
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,130
to stop me from yelling.

23
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,020
This is what
terrified me the most

24
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,590
and has had the most
lasting impact on my life.

25
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,770
It was hard for me to breathe,

26
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,360
and I thought that
Brett was accidentally

27
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,800
going to kill me.”

28
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,890
“Dr. Ford, with what degree
of certainty do you believe

29
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,950
Brett Kavanaugh
assaulted you?”

30
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,020
“One hundred percent.”

31
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,770
“What is the strongest
memory you have?”

32
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,490
“Indelible in the hippocampus
is the laughter —

33
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:48,480
the uproarious laughter
between the two,

34
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,746
and they’re having
fun at my expense.”

35
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,970
“You’ve never forgotten
that laughter,

36
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,340
never forgotten them
laughing at you?”

37
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:07,099
“I was underneath one of them
while the two laughed —

38
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:10,680
two friends having a really
good time with one another.”

39
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,110
“Are you aware that
the three people

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,710
at the party besides yourself
and Brett Kavanaugh

41
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,710
have given statements
under penalty of felony

42
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,480
to the committee?”

43
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,180
“Yes.”

44
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,960
“And are you aware of
what those statements say?”

45
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,250
“Yes.”

46
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,640
“Are you aware that they say
that they have no memory

47
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,860
or knowledge of such a party?”

48
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,840
“I don’t expect that
P.J. and Leland

49
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,440
would remember
this evening.

50
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,380
It was a very
unremarkable party.

51
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:46,860
It was not one of their
more notorious parties.

52
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,030
Because nothing remarkable
happened to them that evening —

53
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,750
they were downstairs.

54
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,750
And Mr. Judge is
a different story —

55
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,820
I would expect that he would
remember that this happened.”

56
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,080
“I categorically and
unequivocally deny

57
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,840
the allegation against
me by Dr. Ford.

58
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,800
This whole two-week effort

59
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,390
has been a calculated and
orchestrated political hit,

60
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,870
fueled with apparent
pent-up anger

61
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:18,030
about President Trump
and the 2016 election,

62
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,520
fear that has been
unfairly stoked

63
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,740
about my judicial record,

64
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,950
revenge on behalf
of the Clintons

65
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,830
and millions of dollars
in money

66
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:31,490
from outside, left-wing
opposition groups.

67
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,460
The other night, Ashley
and my daughter Liza

68
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,000
said their prayers.

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,150
And little Liza,
all of 10 years old,

70
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,770
said to Ashley, we should
pray for the woman.”

71
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,150
“Was there ever a time
when you drink so much

72
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,810
that you couldn’t remember
what happened

73
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,560
or part of what happened
the night before?”

74
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,050
“I – no. I remember
what happened.

75
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:05,890
And, I think you’ve probably
had beers, Senator, and so —”

76
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,750
“So you’re saying there’s
never been a case

77
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,460
where you drank so much
that you didn’t remember

78
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,650
what happened the night before,
or part of what happened?”

79
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,830
“That’s — you’re asking
about yeah, blackout.

80
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,140
I don’t know, have you?”

81
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,399
“Could you answer
the question, Judge?

82
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,650
And just — so you —
that’s not happened?

83
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,760
Is that your answer?”

84
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,760
“Yeah, and I’m curious if you have.”

85
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,550
“I have no drinking
problem, Judge.”

86
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,760
“Yeah, nor do I.”

87
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,210
“O.K., thank you.”

88
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:38,710
“In your yearbook,
you talked about drinking

89
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,030
and sexual exploits,
did you not?”

90
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:50,390
“Senator, let me take a step
back and explain high school.

91
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,900
I was No. 1 in the class,
freshman —”

92
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,480
“And I thought —”

93
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,670
“No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.”

94
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,210
“I thought only the Senate
could filibuster.”

95
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,320
“I’m going to talk
about my high school —”

96
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,270
“I thought only the
Senate could filibuster.”

97
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:58,890
“No, no, I’m going to talk —”

98
00:04:58,890 --> 00:04:59,760
“Let him answer.”

99
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,710
“I’m going to talk about
my high school record

100
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,971
if you’re going to sit here
and mock me.”

101
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:07,680
“You said, ‘I welcome any
kind of investigation.’

102
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,700
I quote you.

103
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,010
‘I welcome any kind
of investigation.’”

104
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,031
“I welcome whatever the
committee wants to do,

105
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:14,250
because I’m telling the truth.”

106
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,230
“I want to know
what you want to do.”

107
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,032
“I’m telling the truth.”

108
00:05:16,032 --> 00:05:17,780
“I want to know what
you want to do, Judge.”

109
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,050
“I’m innocent.
I’m innocent of this charge.”

110
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,960
“Then you’re prepared
for an F.B.I. investigation?”

111
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,410
“They don‘t reach conclusions.

112
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,600
You reach the conclusions, Senator.“

113
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,380
“No, but they do
investigate questions.”

114
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,800
“If you wanted
an F.B.I. investigation,

115
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,540
you could’ve come to us.

116
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,660
What you want to do is
destroy this guy’s life,

117
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,350
hold this seat open
and hope you win in 2020.

118
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,530
You said that, not me.

119
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,970
You’ve got nothing
to apologize for.

120
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,680
When you see
Sotomayor and Kagan,

121
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,020
tell him that
Lindsey said hello.

122
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,650
Because I voted for them.

123
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,000
I would never do to them
what you’ve done to this guy.

124
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,470
This is the most
unethical sham

125
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,860
since I’ve been in politics.

126
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,282
And if you really wanted
to know the truth,

127
00:06:02,282 --> 00:06:03,740
you sure as hell
wouldn’t have done

128
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,660
what you’ve done to this guy.

129
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,120
Are you a gang rapist?”

130
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,890
“No.”

131
00:06:12,650 --> 00:00:00,000
“I cannot imagine what you and
your family have gone through.”
