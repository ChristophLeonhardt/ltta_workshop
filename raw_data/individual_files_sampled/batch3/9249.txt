ROB: ONE STEP CLOSER TO SETTING THE STAGE FOR THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. MAJOR VICTORIES FOR BOTH PARTIES AND CANDIDATES FOR NOVEMBER, AND FORMER POLLSTER FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, CHRIS WILSON, STARTING WITH INDIANA. AND HOW MUCH MONEY MATTERS. IT SEEMS LIKE INDIANA MONEY MATTERS TO DO. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BROAD VIEW REPUBLICANS HAVE GOT TO BE EXCITED ABOUT HIM COMING OUT OF THE SENATORIAL COMMITTEE, THEY HAD A GREAT NIGHT. PRETTY MUCH IN EVERY RACE. A CONSERVATIVE BUSINESSMAN, CONSENSUAL THE SUCCESSFUL BACKGROUND, AND A MAINSTREAM CANDIDATE AT THE SAME TIME. HE IS NOT A PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN, JOE DONNELLY IS VULNERABLE, MORE PEOPLE WENT HIM, MORE DESERVE REELECTION THEN DOES. WHEN YOU LOOK AT TURNOUT, MOST REPUBLICANS OVER 2014, THE LAST MIDTERM ELECTION, TURNOUT HAS BEEN DOWN, MORE THAN IT WAS FOR DEMOCRATS. REPUBLICANS HAVE THE RESULTING INDIANA. ROB: THE RICH BUSINESSMAN TREND CONTINUES. A CHANCE OF DEFEATING DONNELLY, SENATE SEAT REPUBLICANS WANT. BRON GIVES REPUBLICANS THE LAST CHANCE, IT IS A TOSSUP. IF NOT, A LITTLE BIT OF A SLIDE BECAUSE REPUBLICANS TRENDING NATURE OF THE STATE. ROB: I WAS THERE IN OHIO SPEAKING WITH VOTERS, THE RESULTS NO SURPRISE. RENACCI. REPUBLICANS GOT WHAT THEY WANTED. REPUBLICANS LED IN EVERY STATEWIDE RACE IN TURN OUT. I KEEP GOING BACK TO THAT SECOND BECAUSE DEMOCRATS CONTINUE TO MAKE THE CLAIM WE HAVE THE ENTHUSIASM ON OUR SIDE AND LAST NIGHT SAW THAT TREND REVERSED. OHIO IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE. THE SOLID BACKGROUND, ONE OF THESE SITUATIONS WHEN YOU LOOK AT RECENT POLLING, INCUMBENT SENATORS SAID MORE PEOPLE IT IS AT BEST A TOSSUP. REPUBLICANS PICK THIS UP. ROB: REPUBLICANS LOVE HIM BUT MANCHIN COULD BE A REPUBLICAN IN ANY OTHER STATE. DOES HE HAVE A CHANCE OF BEATING MANCHIN? MANCHIN IS IN WEST VIRGINIA BUT IT IS EARLY. ROB: I APOLOGIZE. DOES HE HAVE A CHANCE OF WINNING THE SENATE? HE DOES. IT HAS GOT TO BE A TOSSUP BECAUSE OHIO IS MUCH LIKE INDIANA, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TURNOUT GAPS REPUBLICANS LED IN EVERY STATEWIDE RACE IN TURN OUT. THAT A HUGE FAN FOR DEMOCRATS THAT THEY ARE IN TROUBLE. I WAS SO EAGER TO GET TO WEST VIRGINIA. SEEMS LIKE PATRICK MORRISSEY JUST SURVIVED. OF AN DRAGONTEMPLATE, DON BLANKENSHIP HAD A LEAD BUT MORRISSEY JUST SURVIVED THIS THING. I WOULD DISPUTE THAT BECAUSE I KNOW PATRICK MORRISSEY. HE IS AN INDEFATIGABLE CAMPAIGNER. I NEVER MET SOMEONE WHO WORKED AS HARD. HE CAME FROM BEHIND. BLANKENSHIP HAD TO LEAD, HE GOT IN FRONT, THE PRES. GOT INVOLVED, AND HIS SON TWEETED OUT, LET'S GET BEHIND, JENKINS, AN INTERESTING STRATEGY WITH THE DEMOCRATS, THEY TRIED TO BEAT JENKINS, THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL IN DRIVING JENKINS'S NUMBERS DOWN BUT HE IS THE ONE CANDIDATE WHO CAN BEAT MANCHIN WHO IS IN REAL TROUBLE. HIS OPPONENT IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY 14-1, GOT A LITTLE MORE THAN 65% OF THE VOTE. A HUGE HARBINGER THAT HE HAS REAL CHALLENGES NOT ONLY WITH AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER COULD BE A REPUBLICAN, THAT DOESN'T GET HIS BASE EXCITED AND REPUBLICANS GO
