EXCEPTIONAL INDIVIDUAL AND THE

30
00:00:52,108 --> 00:00:55,311
KIND OF GUY WE WENT ON THE

THIS WHERE THERE ARE ALL THESE

43
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:15,431

53
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,918
I THOUGHT BRETT KAVANAUGH

00:01:34,918 --> 00:01:35,652
HANDLED HIMSELF EXTREMELY WELL

55
00:01:35,652 --> 00:01:37,587

I THINK HE IS SO QUALIFIED AND

57
00:01:38,321 --> 00:01:41,658
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT HIM ON

00:01:41,658 --> 00:01:42,392

00:01:42,392 --> 00:01:43,126

60
00:01:43,126 --> 00:01:46,896
GETS ON THE COURT.
