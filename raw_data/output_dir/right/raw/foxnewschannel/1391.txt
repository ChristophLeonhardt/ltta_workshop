A NEW POLL IS OUT AND IT SHOWS

13
00:00:20,923 --> 00:00:23,125
THAT NFL FANS OVERWHELMINGLY

14
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:24,293
SUPPORT THE LEAGUE'S POLICY ON

15
00:00:24,293 --> 00:00:26,061
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM THAT IF YOU

16
00:00:26,061 --> 00:00:27,763
ARE NOT GOING TO STAND FOR THE

17
00:00:27,763 --> 00:00:29,131
NATIONAL ANTHEM, YOU CAN GO BACK

18
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:31,233
AND GO SIT IN THE LOCKER ROOM.

19
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:32,734
ARE YOU SURPRISED BY THOSE

20
00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:33,035
STATS?

21
00:00:33,035 --> 00:00:34,903
>> FIRST OF ALL, I'M VERY HAPPY

22
00:00:34,903 --> 00:00:38,640
THAT THE NFL IS STANDING UP FOR

23
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,074
WHAT'S RIGHT.

24
00:00:39,074 --> 00:00:39,575
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

25
00:00:39,575 --> 00:00:41,543
>> AND STANDING UP FOR THE

26
00:00:41,543 --> 00:00:44,780
VETERANS, THE PATRIOTIC FANS IN

THESE PLAYERS STAND FOR THE

29
00:00:48,317 --> 00:00:48,617
FLAG.

30
00:00:48,617 --> 00:00:49,918
THIS IS NOT ABOUT A WHITE THING

31
00:00:49,918 --> 00:00:51,120
OR A BLACK THING.

32
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,521
THIS IS ABOUT DOING THE RIGHT

33
00:00:52,521 --> 00:00:52,821
THING.

VETERANS, SALUTE THE FLAG IN

39
00:01:01,563 --> 00:01:04,199
HONOR OF THEM.

40
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,003
OUR VETERANS DIDN'T KNEEL, THEY

41
00:01:08,003 --> 00:01:10,205
STOOD UP AND FOUGHT FOR OUR

42
00:01:10,205 --> 00:01:10,539
FREEDOM.

43
00:01:10,539 --> 00:01:12,407
IT'S TIME TO STAND UP AND HONOR

44
00:01:12,407 --> 00:01:14,843
AND RESPECT THEM.

45
00:01:14,843 --> 00:01:16,178
>> IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAVE

46
00:01:16,178 --> 00:01:20,983
HAPPENED IF THEY KNEELED AND

47
00:01:20,983 --> 00:01:23,118
SURRENDERED AND JUST SAID FORGET

48
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:23,385
IT.

49
00:01:23,385 --> 00:01:25,521
WHAT DO THESE FOOTBALL PLAYERS

50
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:27,956
DO DOING THEIR OFF SEASON.

51
00:01:27,956 --> 00:01:29,625
DID THEY DO ANY TYPE OF

52
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:30,025
PROTESTING?

53
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:31,760
YOU STAND FOR THE FLAG AR YOU

54
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,428
CAN KNEEL IN THE LOCKER ROOM OR

55
00:01:33,428 --> 00:01:35,964
IN THE UNLOIMENT LINE.

56
00:01:35,964 --> 00:01:37,833

NBA AS WELL.

67
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:43,438
COACH OF THE WARRIORS SAID WHAT

68
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:45,841
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS FAKE

69
00:01:45,841 --> 00:01:46,241
PATRIOTISM.

70
00:01:46,241 --> 00:01:46,909
WHAT'S YOUR REACTION?

71
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:49,378
>> IT'S NOT FAKE PATRIOTISM.

72
00:01:49,378 --> 00:01:50,245
WAIT A MINUTE.

73
00:01:50,245 --> 00:01:52,347
WE LIVE IN ONE OF THE GREATEST

74
00:01:52,347 --> 00:01:53,248
COUNTRIES ON THIS EARTH.

75
00:01:53,248 --> 00:01:53,916
I'M SORRY.

76
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,617
YOU NEED TO STAND FOR THE FLAG.

77
00:01:55,617 --> 00:01:57,186
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO STAND FOR

78
00:01:57,186 --> 00:01:59,821
THE FLAG AND YOU DON'T LIKE THE

79
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:01,256
PATRIOTISM THAT GOES ON IN THIS

80
00:02:01,256 --> 00:02:03,091
COUNTRY AND YOU DON'T LIKE

81
00:02:03,091 --> 00:02:05,227
MAKING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, PACK

82
00:02:05,227 --> 00:02:07,229
YOUR KNAPSACK AND GO TO ONE OF

83
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:08,229
THESE COUNTRIES WHERE YOU DON'T

84
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,097
HAVE FREEDOM.

85
00:02:09,097 --> 00:02:10,199
THAT'S WHAT YOU CAN DO.

86
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,034
BUT IN THIS COUNTRY YOU NEED TO

87
00:02:12,034 --> 00:02:14,269
STAND FOR THE FLAG OR GO

88
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:16,038
SOMEWHERE LIKE A COWARD AND HIDE

89
00:02:16,038 --> 00:02:17,306
IN THE LOCKER ROOM.

90
00:02:17,306 --> 00:02:19,741
>> WHEN YOU KNEEL ON THE FLAG,

91
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:20,943
YOUR MESSAGE IS GETTING LOST.

92
00:02:20,943 --> 00:02:26,248
IF YOU WANT TO PROTEST, PROTEST

93
00:02:26,248 --> 00:02:27,182
FOR SOMETHING.

94
00:02:27,182 --> 00:02:29,418
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PROTESTING AND

95
00:02:29,418 --> 00:02:31,320
MARCHING FOR YEARS AND WHAT HAVE

96
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,588
THEY GOTTEN.

97
00:02:32,588 --> 00:02:34,189
THEY'RE STILL MARCHING AND

98
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:35,390
PROTESTING TALKING ABOUT

99
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:40,262
INJUSTICE, WE WANT TO CLIMB UP

100
00:02:40,262 --> 00:02:43,532
THE MOUNTAIN AND DON'T REALIZE

101
00:02:43,532 --> 00:02:45,601
YOU'VE MADE TIGHT THE

YOU'VE MADE IT TT THE

105
00:02:45,867 --> 00:02:47,035
YOU'VE MADE IT TO THE TOP OF THE

106
00:02:47,035 --> 00:02:47,402
MOUNTAIN.

107
00:02:47,402 --> 00:02:48,704
IF YOU WANT TO PROTESTING WITH

108
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,072
GO THERE AND PROTEST WHAT'S

109
00:02:50,072 --> 00:02:51,340
GOING ON THERE, NOT THE FLAG.

110
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,209
>> AND NOT ON OUR TIME OR DIME.

111
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:55,711
>> IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE

112
00:02:55,711 --> 00:02:58,180
IF THIS ENDS THE DISCUSSION OR

113
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,181
IF IT CONTINUES.

114
00:02:59,181 --> 00:03:00,682
BUT WE'VE GOT TO GET YOUR TAKE

115
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:02,384
ON ANOTHER ISSUE, SOMEBODY YOU

116
00:03:02,384 --> 00:03:04,453
GUYS HAVE BEEN FRONT AND CENTER

117
00:03:04,453 --> 00:03:06,622
ON, THE CENSORING OF

118
00:03:06,622 --> 00:03:07,990
CONSERVATIVE CONTENT ACROSS

119
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,890
SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS.

120
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,525
IT HAS BEEN HAPPENING TO YOU AND

121
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:12,327
YOU'VE BEEN OUTSPOKEN,

122
00:03:12,327 --> 00:03:13,495
TESTIFYING ABOUT IT.

123
00:03:13,495 --> 00:03:15,264
WE BLOOF IT MIGHT BE HAPPENING

124
00:03:15,264 --> 00:03:16,632
TO THE PRESIDENT'S SON.

125
00:03:16,632 --> 00:03:18,667
DONALD TRUMP JR. POSTED THIS ON

126
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:20,435
INSTAGRAM JUST RECENTLY SAYING,

127
00:03:20,435 --> 00:03:22,571
IF THIS ACCOUNT, QUOTE, COULD

128
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:24,740
CAUSE HARM AND EVEN LEAD TO

129
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,075
DEATH, END QUOTE, WHICH IS WHAT

130
00:03:27,075 --> 00:03:30,479
SOME OF HIS FOLLOWERS WERE TOLD,

131
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,616
THE HASHTAG AND ANY CONSERVATIVE

132
00:03:34,616 --> 00:03:38,053
THOUGHT HAS TO ZOPP.

133
00:03:38,053 --> 00:03:38,353
STOP.

134
00:03:38,353 --> 00:03:41,556
HE ADDED ZERO NEW FOLLOWERS.

135
00:03:41,556 --> 00:03:44,559
HE FEELS HE'S BEEN CENSORED

136
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:45,127
ONLINE.

137
00:03:45,127 --> 00:03:46,194
WOULD THAT SURPRISE YOU?

138
00:03:46,194 --> 00:03:47,696
>> IT'S NOT SURPRISING BECAUSE

139
00:03:47,696 --> 00:03:49,965
IT'S HAPPENING TO A LOT OF

140
00:03:49,965 --> 00:03:50,799
CONSERVATIVE VOICES.

141
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:51,667
IT'S HAPPENING TO THE PRESIDENT

142
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:52,234
OF THE UNITED STATES.

143
00:03:52,234 --> 00:03:52,734
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

144
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:56,538
>> AND IT MUST STOP.

145
00:03:56,538 --> 00:03:58,840
IF WE DON'T GET A HANDLE ON

146
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,175
THIS, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE

147
00:04:00,175 --> 00:04:01,843
SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS DICTATING

148
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:04,313
EVERYTHING TO US, TELLING US

149
00:04:04,313 --> 00:04:05,981
WHAT WE CAN AND CANNOT SEE.

150
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:08,450
WE KNOW THE SOCIAL MEDIA

151
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,485
PLATFORMS LIKE FACEBOOK AND

152
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:12,054
INSTAGRAM AND TWITTER ARE TRYING

153
00:04:12,054 --> 00:04:13,922
TO WIN AN ELECTION FOR THE LEFT

154
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:15,157
AND IT IS NOT GOING TO WORK.

155
00:04:15,157 --> 00:04:16,958
THIS IS CENSORSHIP.

156
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:17,959
SUPPRESSION OF FORCES.

157
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,560
IF THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A

158
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,596
PLATFORM FOR ALL IDEAS, YOU

159
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:23,899
CAN'T SUPPRESS SOME IDEAS, YOU

160
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:26,902
CAN'T DEEM THEM AS HATE.

161
00:04:26,902 --> 00:04:27,602
THAT'S OFFENSIVE DEEMING

162
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:29,604
SOMEBODY LIKE HATE AND MAKING

163
00:04:29,604 --> 00:04:30,806
THEM LOOK LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO

164
00:04:30,806 --> 00:04:33,175
DIE IF THEY DO PICTURES OF THEIR

165
00:04:33,175 --> 00:04:34,042
FAMILY.

166
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:35,277
THAT'S OFFENSIVE AND THAT NEEDS

167
00:04:35,277 --> 00:04:36,445
TO BE BROUGHT TO THE TABLE AND

168
00:04:36,445 --> 00:04:37,179
THAT NEEDS TO STOP.

169
00:04:37,179 --> 00:04:38,246
>> ALL RIGHT.

170
00:04:38,246 --> 00:04:39,448
GREAT POINT.

171
00:04:39,448 --> 00:04:41,350
WE DID REACH OUT TO INSTAGRAM

172
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,051
FOR COMMENT TO GET THEIR

173
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:43,485
RESPONSE.

174
00:04:43,485 --> 00:04:45,754
WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED ONE AS OF

175
00:04:45,754 --> 00:04:46,021
YET.

176
00:04:46,021 --> 00:04:47,856
WE HOPE YOU'RE ENJOYING YOUR

177
00:04:47,856 --> 00:04:49,524
MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND AND CLEARLY

178
00:04:49,524 --> 00:04:51,893
YOU ARE RESPECTING THE SACRIFICE

179
00:04:51,893 --> 00:04:53,995
MADE BY THOSE WHO PAID THE

180
00:04:53,995 --> 00:04:54,463
ULTIMATE PRICE.

181
00:04:54,463 --> 00:00:00,000
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BOTH.
