>> Neil: YOU KNOW, I JUST SHOOK
THE HULK'S HAND.
HE BROKE IT.
SO ANYWAY, THE PRESIDENT, DID
YOU SEE THIS TODAY?
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT.
IT WAS SURREAL.
NO MATTER HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THE
PRESIDENT, I THOUGHT IT WAS
RIVETING TO WATCH.
HE FIELDED A LOT OF QUESTIONS.
SOME IN YOUR FACE, SOME NOT.
BUT IT WAS NONSTOP AND SOMETHING
TO WATCH.
SOMETHING FOR THE AGES.
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL"'S
JILLIAN IS HERE AND JESSE IS
HERE.
WHEN YOU'RE ON THE LEFT OR THE
RIGHT, THE PRESIDENT, THEY
ALWAYS CRITICIZE HIM.
HE DID AN INFORMAL PRESS
CONFERENCE THAT LASTED ABOUT AN
HOUR WITH EVERYBODY CONCERNED.
DID YOU SEE?
IT WAS RIVETING.
>> YEAH.
THEY CRITICIZE HIM FOR THIS NOW,
THE IMPROMPTU PRESS CONFERENCE.
I THINK HE'S BECOME SO
POLARIZING, EITHER SIDE HAS
AGENDA.
>> Neil: BUT HE DID IT.
>> AND HE DID SOMETHING OUT OF
THE NORM.
AND IT WAS A NICE DAY.
WHY NOT HAVE THE PRESS
CONFERENCE OUTSIDE?
I WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME
THING.
>> HE TOLD PEOPLE.
I'M GOING TO COME OUT.
>> AND SURPRISE!
>> Neil: A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE HE
HASN'T HAD A FORMAL PRESS
CONFERENCE.
>> I FEEL LIKE HE'S MISSED SOME
OF THE OPPORTUNITIES TO PRESENT
A DISCIPLINED MESSAGE AND THINGS
LIKE THIS.
MAYBE THEY ARE UP IN THE AIR,
BUT IT DOES HELP DRIVE THAT
NARRATIVE FORWARD, ESPECIALLY IF
HE STAYS ON MESSAGE.
>> HE DOESN'T HAVE A PRESS
CONFERENCE, PEOPLE ARE UPSET.
IF HE DOES, PEOPLE ARE UPSET.
HE DOES IT IN A WEIRD WAY.
THE MAIN WAY HE COMMUNICATES IS
THROUGH TWITTER AND WE HEAR WHAT
HE THINKS ON TWITTER.
I DON'T THINK A THOUGHT GOES
THROUGH HIS HEAD.
>> Neil: AND HE WILL PUT A
REPORTER DOWN AND THEN GOES
BACK.
BOOM, BOOM.
I'LL WELCOME IT.
>> THE STATISTIC YOU GAVE IS
LIKE OBAMA TAKING TEN QUESTIONS
AND TRUMP WILL TAKE 40.
IT'S SO POLARIZING NOW.
WE'VE ENTERED A NEW STAGE WHERE
THERE'S NO DECORUM ANYMORE.
THE REPORTERS WERE SUPPOSED TO
BE OBJECTIONABLE.
NOW THEY'RE GOING AT IT, SHOWING
THEIR BIAS.
>> I DO THINK THAT CONTRAST IS
DEEPER.
BECAUSE WE SAW A JOURNALIST
TAKING A STEP BACK AND NOT BEING
THAT AGGRESSIVE IN THE OBAMA
YEARS.
I'M ALL FOR IT.
IF YOU DON'T WANT IT PRINTED,
DON'T LET IT HAPPEN.
GOODNESS SAKES, WE DIDN'T --
>> LOOK AT SARAH SANDERS'S PRESS
CONFERENCE.
PEOPLE WERE CRAZY.
>> Neil: I DON'T THINK JUST
BECAUSE YOU ASK QUESTIONS, YOUR
NEWS IS FAKE.
THERE SHOULD BE MORE.
>> SETS THE BAR IN YEARS TO
