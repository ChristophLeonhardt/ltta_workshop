I HAVE NEVER ENGAGED IN
NONCONSENSUAL SEX WHICH IS A
LINE IT WOULD NOT CROSS."
ALSO DEVELOPING TONIGHT, AND THE
WEALTHY ENCLAVE OF BELHAVEN AND
GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT, A
15-YEAR-OLD GIRL'S BODY WAS
FOUND UNDER A PINE TREE.
SHE HAD BEEN HIT SO HARD WITH A
GOLF CLUB THAT IT BROKE THE CLUB
IN HALF.
THE BLUNT END WAS USED TO STAB
HER IN THE NECK.
EARLIER THAT NIGHT SHE HAD BEEN
AT THE SCHEDULE HOUSE.
THE KENNEDYS WERE KNOWN FOR
HAVING A LITTLE ADULT
SUPERVISION AFTER THE PASSING OF
THEIR YOUNG MOTHER.
THEN IN THE GARAGE LIKE TYPICAL
TEENAGERS AND WHAT HAPPENED
NEXT, ONLY THOSE WHO WERE THERE
REALLY NO.
WAS SHE KILLED BY THE TUTOR CAN
LITTLETON GMAC OR ONE OF THE
BOYS, MICHAEL OR TOMMY?
MICHAEL SPENT TEN YEARS IN
PRISON BEFORE HIS GUILTY VERDICT
WAS OVERTURNED AND THEN
REINSTATED AND THEN TURNED OVER
AGAIN THIS PAST FRIDAY.
JOINING ME NOW WITH THE FAMILY'S
REACTION IS MARTHA'S BROTHER
JOHN MOXLEY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING
HERE.
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
YOU AND YOUR MOTHER HAVE STOOD
UP FOR YOUR SISTER AND WHAT
HAPPENED TO HER ALL THESE YEARS
AND SAT THROUGH ALL THESE
TRIALS.
WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND WHEN
THIS GOT OVERTURNED AGAIN ON
FRIDAY?
>> IT'S FRUSTRATING AT BEST,
BECAUSE AS YOU'VE SAID WE SAT
THROUGH, I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU
HOW MANY TRIALS.
WE'VE BEEN IN FRONT OF THE
CONNECTICUT STATE SUPREME COURT
A FEW TIMES AND EVERY TIME THEY
HAVE RULED IN OUR FAVOR OR THEY
DIDN'T BUY INTO THE ARGUMENTS
AND I WAS AT THE TRIAL EVERY DAY
AND THIS IS THE WEAKEST ARGUMENT
AND THIS IS THE WEAKEST ARGUMEN
ARGUMENT, THE INEFFECTIVE
COUNSEL THAT THEY HAD.
THE MEMBERS OF THE COURT CHANGED
THE JUDGE THAT WROTE THE
MAJORITY OPINION RETIRED, JUDGE
PALMER THAT WROTE THE DISSENT I
THINK WAITED.
IF THEY WERE ASKED TO
RECONSIDER.
THEY JUST MADE A DECISION WHY
THEY NEED TO RECONSIDER.
BUT THE RECONSTITUTION OF THE
COURT CHANGED EVERYTHING.
>> Martha: WHO DO BELIEVE
KILLED MARTHA?
>> MICHAEL.
I'M ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED OF IT.
I SAT THROUGH THE TRIAL EVERY
DAY.
I HEARD ALL THE EVIDENCE.
THE ONLY THING THAT I DON'T KNOW
THAT I SUSPECT IS THAT HIS
BROTHER TOMMY AND PERHAPS HIS
COUSIN JIMMY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
I DON'T THINK HIS YOUNGER
BROTHERS KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
I THINK THEY WERE INNOCENT.
THAT'S WHY THEY ARE STANDING BY
HIM TODAY BUT YOU NEVER SEE ANY
OF HIS OLDER SIBLINGS.
>> Martha: AS YOU LOOK BACK ON
THIS WHOLE THING AND YOU THINK
ABOUT THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE
FAMILIES.
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A FAMILY THAT
HAS A REPUTATION FOR CIRCLING
THE WAGONS AND PROTECTING EACH
OTHER.
HOW MUCH OF THAT CAME INTO PLAY
HERE?
>> A LOT OF THE FAMILY WASN'T
THERE.
THERE WERE SOME STAUNCH
SUPPORTERS.
THEIR BROTHER, THEIR COUSIN.
IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO STAND UP
FOR YOUR FAMILY, WHO ARE YOU
GOING TO STAND UP FOR?
BUT THEY CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT OF
PRACTICE.
>> Martha: YOU BELIEVE THAT
TOMMY MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED?
>> YES.
>> Martha: WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO NOW?
WHAT IS YOUR NEXT STEP NOW THAT
THIS IS BEEN OVERTURNED?
>> AS I UNDERSTAND IT, NOW THAT
THE COURT HAS REVERSED THEIR
DECISION AND MADE A DECISION,
THE STATE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO
LOOK AT THE DECISION AND SEE IF
THERE'S ROOM TO MANEUVER, AND I
DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.
I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY.
IT'S THE STATE'S TURN TO LOOK AT
THAT DECISION AND DECIDE WHETHER
OR NOT TO APPEAL OR NOT.
>> Martha: PUT THIS TO REST IN
MY >> IT WILL NEVER BE TO REST.
IT WILL NEVER BE.
IT'S JUST PART OF OUR LIFE AND
WE GO ON WITH IT ON A DAY-TO-DAY
BASIS.
WE TRY TO HAVE A POSITIVE
OUTLOOK.
THERE'S NO HATE IN OUR HEARTS,
IT'S JUST TOO HEAVY OF A BURDEN
TO BEAR, BUT IT'S JUST THE LIFE
WE KNOW.
THE ROLLER COASTER OF ALL OF
THESE DECISIONS.
IT'S AMAZING THAT SINCE 2002 --
BEFORE 2002, ALL OF THE ONE-MAN
GRAND JURY, ALL OF THE
PRELIMINARY TRIALS, ALL OF THE
INVESTIGATION, ALL OF THE FALSE
LEADS, EVERYTHING LED BACK TO
MICHAEL.
AND THROUGH HIS OWN DEEDS IN HIS
OWN WORDS PUTS HIMSELF AT THE
PLACE AT THE TIME AND EXPLAINS
WHY THEY WOULD BE PHYSICAL
