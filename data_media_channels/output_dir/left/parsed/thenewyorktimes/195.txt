This is the person that police
say killed 10 people
at a Texas high school.
And this is his Facebook
page.
Since the shooting,
it’s been taken down.
But one thing notable
about the photos
is the appearance
of several symbols,
some seeming to
contradict others.
Here’s what we know
about them.
On his hat is this heart pin.
It’s sold on numerous
websites labeled
as a bisexual pride pin.
Next, on the jacket.
This hammer and sickle pin
with a red star
is a common symbol of communism.
It was most notably
on the Soviet flag.
The suspect writes that to
him, it symbolized rebellion.
And, indeed, on some websites
the pins are marketed 
as symbols of anarchy.
On the opposite lapel
is what looks to
be a Japanese flag.
The suspect
apparently believed
it symbolizes
kamikaze tactics.
Those were the tactics
of Japanese pilots
who intentionally crashed
their planes into enemy ships
during World War II.
Here is the German iron cross,
an award for military heroism,
not issued since World War II.
It’s now often used as a hate
symbol by white supremacists
but not exclusively.
The suspect writes that the
cross symbolizes bravery.
This symbol is associated
with a satanic idol.
Pins with this symbol are
often marketed
as endorsed 
by the Church of Satan.
The suspect writes 
that it symbolizes evil.
The Cthulhu here
is a creature that’s often
found in science fiction
and described as dead,
but dreaming.
There are several ways people
interpret the Cthulhu,
but the suspect writes that
to him, it symbolizes power.
Finally, in total
contradiction
to the suspect’s
alleged actions,
we see him wearing
the peace symbol.
