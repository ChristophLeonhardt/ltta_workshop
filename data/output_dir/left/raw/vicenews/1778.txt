00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,490
probably read it so let's go ahead and

29
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,840
get started with<font color="#CCCCCC"> our first skype guest</font>

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,460
and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alex who's calling us from</font>

31
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,900
somewhere in Canada hey where are you

32
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">somewhere in Canada uh pretty much the</font>

33
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,750
middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of nowhere uh yeah I could show</font>

34
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,310
you I guess oh it's like right now bit

35
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,770
cold anyways<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm calling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask about a</font>

36
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,500
marijuana legalization and how the

37
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,850
government is planning on<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving forward</font>

38
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,470
with it because as I'm sure you're aware

39
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,060
there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of international</font>

40
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,950
treaties that prohibit the production

41
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,840
and possession of<font color="#CCCCCC"> marijuana so I was</font>

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,460
wondering<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had any ideas how the</font>

43
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,840
government was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get around those</font>

44
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,040
obstacles okay so there are apparently

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,170
these treaties that prohibit marijuana I

46
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,549
don't know what they are and no one's

47
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,619
actually told<font color="#E5E5E5"> me what they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are this is a</font>

48
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:53,909
news story that came out the last couple

49
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:54,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">days saying the Trudeau government's</font>

50
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:56,159
gonna have a headache actually

51
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,409
legalizing marijuana because apparently

52
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,939
some international treaty forbids of

53
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,159
doing so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably sounds a lot of</font>

54
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,049
 to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me it sounds to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me like</font>

55
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:05,850
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of trying to figure out</font>

56
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,619
reasons why this thing's not going to

57
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:08,669
work we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to work as quickly</font>

58
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,649
as the turtle government wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

59
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:12,840
the fact is legalization<font color="#CCCCCC"> is happening</font>

60
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,230
the

61
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,840
no real legal way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop it if the</font>

62
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">Canadian government wants to legalize</font>

63
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:18,599
marijuana it's fully within his response

64
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,510
its authority to do so but the sidebar

65
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,129
of this is it's gonna take a while I

66
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:24,750
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the turtle government wants</font>

67
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,549
to just forge ahead and just slap this

68
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:29,010
all across the country in the real short

69
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,480
term though a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the provinces right</font>

70
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,700
now sound<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the pretty supportive of</font>

71
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,260
the idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually legalizing Ontario</font>

72
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,730
has recently said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're open to</font>

73
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,129
selling marijuana in government-run

74
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:40,470
alcohol stores so you might actually see

75
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,760
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> provinces come out and start</font>

76
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,319
advocating this and getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> raw raw</font>

77
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,299
about it but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time I think</font>

78
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,310
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting at least a year maybe two</font>

79
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,989
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> before we see this actually start</font>

80
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:51,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">to happen and we actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are able to</font>

81
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,120
pick up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dime bag at the corner store</font>

82
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,290
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a bummer but at the same time I</font>

83
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,540
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are excited enough that</font>

84
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,890
it's gonna happen that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> willing</font>

85
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:03,329
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait another 12 months or so okay so</font>

86
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:06,299
I guess it sounds like maybe might go a

87
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:07,500
bit of the river the Netherlands where

88
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,079
it's got like tolerance but officially

89
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:11,849
not breaking the trees<font color="#E5E5E5"> or do you think</font>

90
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:13,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're just gonna forget the trees</font>

91
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,930
altogether the trainees I mean at a

92
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,859
certain point like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think any</font>

93
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:21,569
anybody to take file a grievance through

94
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,220
any international tribunal saying that

95
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,540
Canada<font color="#CCCCCC"> has reneged on its</font>

96
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,340
responsibilities under whatever treaty

97
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,620
by selling marijuana I mean that's

98
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,389
absurd the Canadian government has the

99
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:33,030
authority to regulate and tax whatever

100
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,579
it feels<font color="#E5E5E5"> like so long as it's not</font>

101
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:36,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">disadvantaged in foreign corporations I</font>

102
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,000
don't see any sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like actual trade</font>

103
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,410
agreements going through it sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

104
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,829
a lot of to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright well</font>

112
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,980
any signs that Canadian mining companies

113
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,410
might face greater scrutiny or sanctions

114
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,569
under<font color="#E5E5E5"> Justin agree as government what do</font>

118
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:14,069
a background about what this looked like

under<font color="#E5E5E5"> Harper and kind of what this tweet</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">accused of doing some really horrible</font>

 everything from gang rapes that

been singled out as being culprits<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

144
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:12,289
mining companies are responsible for

more human rights and environmental

146
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,080

problem right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the Harper government</font>

151
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,860
kind of talked a good game about wanting

152
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">to fix this but every time they had the</font>

153

opportunity they<font color="#CCCCCC"> pushed back and made</font>

154

<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that there was no actual reform</font>

taking place it got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the point where</font>

00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,460
the mining industry itself was asking

157
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">for more regulations and the Harper</font>

158
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:41,300
government wouldn't do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you know</font>

159
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,370
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a problem the good news</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

160
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Trudeau government immediately said</font>

161
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:46,759
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something about this</font>

162
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,590
there's a guy in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> liberal party whose</font>

163
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,270
name is John McKay who introduced

164
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,949
legislation years ago trying to

165
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:54,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically pull any government funding</font>

166
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,789
for mining companies that have been

167
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:57,949
implicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> in abuse unfortunately that</font>

168
00:05:57,949 --> 00:05:59,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't happen because the Harper</font>

169
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:01,279
government totally kibosh the idea I got

170
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:02,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk to him after the Trudeau</font>

171
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,789
government one and he told me<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's super</font>

172
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:05,960
optimistic that they're gonna actually

173
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,759
go above and beyond that they're going

174
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">to probably create an office and that</font>

175
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:11,870
offices entire job is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be to</font>

176
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,430
oversee the mining industry and

177
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,889
basically reprimand any company caught

178
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:21,319
acting badly so short answer yes yes yes

179
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:23,810
I mean how difficult do you think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

180
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,669
to actually pull off a big change like

181
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:28,300
that I mean what's it going to take uh

182
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,620
so some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the infrastructure is already</font>

183
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,779
there they have basically a voluntary

184
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:35,180
reporting mechanism that allows

185
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,820
individuals to<font color="#CCCCCC"> inform</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> countries to</font>

186
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,800
report abuses by canadian mining so

187
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,490
under the

188
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,259
government they had<font color="#CCCCCC"> this system whereby</font>

189
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:43,849
they had a commissioner and her job was

190
00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:45,919
to intake complaints and so initially

191
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,479
there's a bunch of optimism you had

192
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:50,270
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in South America coming to Canada</font>

193
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,770
coming to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Commissioner and saying</font>

194
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,960
hey listen this mining company has done

195
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,669
some really terrible can you look

196
00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:57,110
into this in one case there is a

197
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,960
basically beatings and possibly an

198
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,150
assassination of several union activists

199
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,130
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> South America and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the KA mining</font>

200
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,039
company was totally implicated in it the

201
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,990
Commissioner was basically toothless

202
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,389
they would start investigating but it

203
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,099
was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very clear from the outset that</font>

204
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,139
that Commissioner had no you know no

205
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:17,210
investigative power no power to subpoena

206
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,770
anybody basically if the corporation

207
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,180
didn't want to participate in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

208
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,159
process the process wouldn't happen but

209
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:24,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">the infrastructure is there if you gave</font>

210
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,300
that office actual teeth and you bumped

211
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,710
it up and gave them the ability to

212
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,409
compel witnesses or actually you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

213
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,360
subpoenaed documents right there you

214
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,639
have a huge improvement<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what we've</font>

215
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,440
had before so you might see something

216
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,449
like that happen but it you know it's

217
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:40,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually feasible because you have the</font>

218
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,479
staff you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the resources you have</font>

219
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:43,490
the you know the physical space all you

220
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,719
have to do is give<font color="#E5E5E5"> them the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> power they</font>

221
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:47,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">need awesome Justin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're smart I'm</font>

222
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">glad you work for us this is exciting</font>

223
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right well I hope that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answered</font>

224
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,050
your question mud the dirt and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

225
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,280
without<font color="#CCCCCC"> any further ado</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's go to her</font>

226
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,560
friend Scott Jones who's calling us from

227
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,810
London not Ontario<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> United</font>

228
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,710
Kingdom women look out the bad London hi

American<font color="#CCCCCC"> heads that's behind me awesome</font>

232
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,110
so what Canadian riddles can we solve

233
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:18,590
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you today okay what first question</font>

234
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,159
uh the monarchy um I was wondering

235
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:24,440
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the general feeling is</font>

236
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,789
with regards to the monarchy and the

237
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:29,030
future of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> monarchy in Canada and if</font>

238
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">that will change in any way shape or</font>

239
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,510
form with regards to the new government

240
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,399
that you have that would be your first

241
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,529
question I'm Justin I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will let you feel</font>

242
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:39,409
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh as much as I would love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font>

243
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:40,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this government is going to abolish</font>

244
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:42,649
the monarchy and turn canada into a

245
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:44,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">republic of some sort it's not gonna</font>

246
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,839
happen Trudeau loves the monarchy he has

247
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,640
I'm sure some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of vague liberal</font>

248
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,980
crush on the Queen if anything the

249
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,050
institution's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get stronger</font>

250
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,480
in the previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> government was all about</font>

251
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">the monarchy this government probably</font>

252
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">gonna try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to top them on it though I'll</font>

253
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,089
say this there was one moment where we

254
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:04,880
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> had the gas minor monarchy</font>

255
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,070
squabble when the turtle government

256
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">first won the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Harper government had put</font>

257
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:11,300
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> these giant portraits of the Queen</font>

258
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,970
inside our foreign affairs building and

259
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,890
it was all minute they basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> took</font>

260
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,260
down this great Canadian painters work

261
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,240
put up<font color="#CCCCCC"> a portrait of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Queen and</font>

262
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,560
everyone kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of got uncomfortable</font>

263
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,300
because putting up Johnny ports of the

264
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,760
queen is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a very Canadian</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to do</font>

265
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,170
so when Trudeau won one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

266
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,279
things they did was take down the

267
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,720
portrait put the original paintings back

268
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,760
up and the monarchist League which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

269
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,339
learned is a real thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> what apeshit and</font>

270
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:37,420
it was like a minor political scandal

271
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,680
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the worst scandal of all time</font>

272
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,100
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately it people still still</font>

273
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,839
seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some vague attachment to</font>

274
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:47,920
the Queen oh well can't win them all

275
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,310
though fair enough do you have another

276
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:55,850
Canadian conundrum for us oh yes okay so

277
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:58,940
my second question would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be um do you</font>

278
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,480
know how did NATO react when you guys

279
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,230
pulled out of a Syria that your boy

280
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">their force pulled out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of Syria um and</font>

281
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,560
the fact that you're part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> five guide</font>

282
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,010
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> five eyes even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your the same</font>

283
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,770
intelligence that we have etc etc and I

284
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:22,160
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> too sure how that affected your</font>

285
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,060
standing with within<font color="#E5E5E5"> NATO there's a good</font>

286
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,100
question so first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we haven't</font>

287
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,300
actually pulled out<font color="#E5E5E5"> against the fight</font>

288
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,329
against the Islamic state<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes are</font>

289
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:33,320
actually our fighter jets are still

290
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,660
pounding targets in Iraq and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Syria</font>

291
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,699
actually we've stepped up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of</font>

292
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:38,990
airstrikes we've done in<font color="#CCCCCC"> recent weeks</font>

293
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,120
we've actually been running airstrikes

294
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,220
almost every day<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially through</font>

295
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,140
Christmas in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new year and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font>

296
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,420
totally stepped up on Romney campaign

297
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,829
and we've been in some pretty important

298
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:50,510
missions the turtle government keeps

299
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,070
saying it still wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pull those Jets</font>

300
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,899
out though there's now some skepticism

301
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:55,670
that they might actually flip flop and

302
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,320
say they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna leave them there we</font>

303
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,519
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the impression that there was</font>

304
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:00,199
definitely pressure put on from NATO

305
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:01,699
from the United States and<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

306
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:03,920
Iraqi and Kurdish government asking

307
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,420
Trudeau to leave the fighter jets there

308
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,829
and we get the sense that they might

309
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:07,520
actually be

310
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,500
bending on that request<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually got</font>

311
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,060
to sit down<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a chairperson of NATO</font>

312
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,950
as well as representative from the

313
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,480
Kurdistan government and they actually

314
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,250
pretty cool about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this they don't want</font>

315
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,050
to come out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and start pressuring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Canada</font>

316
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,090
publicly they're definitely asking

317
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,410
behind closed doors but publicly what

318
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,570
they're saying is Canada can do whatever

319
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,190
it wants so long as it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

320
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,140
step back from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mission entirely and</font>

321
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,420
it going to make up the the ending of

322
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,680
the bombing campaign with something else

323
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,210
like humanitarian aid or training

324
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,390
missions we're pretty happy at the same

325
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,850
time NATO is also relying on Canada to

326
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,480
contribute serious air air power and

327
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,700
training capacity in Ukraine and Eastern

328
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,890
Europe for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mission for two different</font>

329
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,140
missions there so I don't think NATO is

330
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,060
exactly frustrated with us<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet i don't</font>

331
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's happy that we're pulling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

332
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,600
our fighter jets from the fight against

333
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,160
the Islamic state<font color="#E5E5E5"> but at the same time</font>

334
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,230
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a NATO mission so I</font>

335
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,340
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's you know kind of</font>

336
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,140
totally upset the relationship and when

337
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,000
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to five eyes Canada's actually</font>

338
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,300
stepped up its intelligence sharing

339
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,050
contribution over the last couple years

340
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,540
so I only<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine the Americans are even</font>

341
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,980
more happy with<font color="#CCCCCC"> us when it comes to</font>

342
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:14,120
spying both at home and abroad so the

343
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,740
Snowden documents that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> released</font>

344
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,420
over the last like six months show the

345
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,640
Canada is an integral partner in tapping

346
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,410
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fiber optic cables that run</font>

347
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,240
underneath the atlantic ocean and that

348
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,210
basically can make up the internet so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

349
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,490
imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know well there might</font>

350
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,170
be a little bit annoyed that we're

351
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">pulling out against the fight against</font>

352
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,380
the Islamic state they're still happy

353
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,270
that we're stepping up elsewhere and

354
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,370
it's worth noting that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at</font>

355
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,290
leaving our other plans there so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font>

356
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,780
might stop actually bombing Isis we

357
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,890
might leave our surveillance and

358
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">refuelling aircraft which are also</font>

359
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,070
pretty important for the air mission so

360
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,590
I they don't seem happy but I don't

361
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:51,530
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the end of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world just um</font>

362
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:55,400
a quick one on that is we had a lot of

363
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,220
whom are here in our<font color="#CCCCCC"> Parliament with</font>

364
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,310
regards to bombing Syria and we had a

365
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:04,280
vote it failed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then Obama didn't</font>

366
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,870
bother having a vote<font color="#CCCCCC"> in America because</font>

367
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,150
he knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would fell we've had a vote</font>

368
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:11,360
go go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through now which has been based</font>

369
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,270
upon their 70,000 ground troops etc

370
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:18,920
which we basically one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of his BS um did</font>

371
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,970
Canada have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar kind of</font>

372
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,009
in your Parliament because if you did it

373
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:26,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't covered here we did we did though</font>

374
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,649
it was under a majority government from

375
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:30,779
Stephen Harper so it was pretty clear

376
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:31,889
from the get-go that that was going to

377
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:35,220
be approved is interesting because it

378
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,750
doesn't look like Trudeau's gonna hold

379
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,220
the similar vote he's actually will

380
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,420
probably pull out the fighter jets would

381
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,649
not let Parliament have a vote on that

382
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:42,779
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of interesting but we did</font>

383
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:45,000
have a bit of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment where it almost</font>

384
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,040
looked like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this vote might not go</font>

385
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,519
through hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe I was no that likely</font>

386
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:53,100
that i was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fail but the bombing</font>

387
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,399
mission in Syria isn't technically legal

388
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,100
under Canadian law there were really

389
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,050
international law because we haven't

390
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,160
declared war on that government

391
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,439
therefore we're kind of bombing a

392
00:14:04,439 --> 00:14:06,240
country that we haven't declared war on

393
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,740
and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> hasn't actually asked us to</font>

394
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,180
bomb so there's a bit of awkwardness

395
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,920
there but we kind of just ignored it and

396
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,139
just moved on so we're just it's vaguely

397
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,870
illegal but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of like yeah it's</font>

398
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">like you know it sort of illegal like</font>

399
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,620
yeah I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not wearing my seatbelt but I'm</font>

400
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,000
also in the middle of Alberta and

401
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,829
there's no cops for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred miles so</font>

402
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:25,139
it's not it's a lawless area who gives a

403
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:29,850
 yeah cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last question to</font>

Nova Scotia that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have like serious</font>

418
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,149

419
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:16,470
made you uncomfortable with our cheese

those questions and putting up with our

423
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:29,160
cheese related puns and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> um before</font>

424
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,079
when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on to our next skype caller</font>

425
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:32,850
we got the street a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes ago</font>

426
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,290
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ryan</font>

427
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,930
who wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there the CPC</font>

428
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,399
that's the conservative party of canada

429
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,259
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> their senator is being backed into</font>

430
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:42,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">corner / pit of death on electoral</font>

431
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,509
reform so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Justin what's going on with</font>

432
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:46,980
electoral reform<font color="#CCCCCC"> give us a little bit of</font>

433
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">the backstory and are the CPC being</font>

434
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,430
backed into the proverbial pit of death

435
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,509
this is actually super interesting so

436
00:15:54,509 --> 00:15:56,220
during the campaign Justin Trudeau

437
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,040
promised that the last election held

438
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,870
months ago will be the last election

439
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,250
ever with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first-past-the-post system</font>

440
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,959
the first-past-the-post system being

441
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,889
that whoever gets the most votes wins

442
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:09,060
the result<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that is that because we</font>

443
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,920
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically four to five party</font>

444
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,529
system is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have a lot of people</font>

445
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:16,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">who win with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty seven thirty thirty</font>

446
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:17,730
two percent of the vote<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have a</font>

447
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:20,220
government elected with you know thirty

448
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,100
thirty two percent of the vote or so so

449
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,110
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a good system no one really</font>

450
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,639
accepts that it's a good system we've

451
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,130
always kind of wanted to change it but

452
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,449
it becomes such a headache to figure out

453
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:32,339
what to replace it<font color="#CCCCCC"> with when two</font>

454
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,620
provinces<font color="#CCCCCC"> pei</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> British Columbia had</font>

455
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,990
their own referenda on trying to change

456
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,910
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system voters opted to stick with</font>

457
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,079
the status<font color="#E5E5E5"> quo because the other</font>

458
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,519
alternatives were too complicated and

459
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,519
weird so Trudeau's promised it the last

460
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:45,660
lecture will be the last one would first

461
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,399
past the post and everyone kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

462
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,779
assumed that the result would be they

463
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,579
would draw up a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of options we one</font>

464
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:52,529
or two and they'd have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> national</font>

465
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:54,209
referendum to decide which one they're

466
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:55,980
gonna go with the problem is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

467
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,449
soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as Trudeau got elected he said oh</font>

468
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,639
no sorry guys we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just gonna change it</font>

469
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,920
tough so there's gonna be no vote

470
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,149
the canadian population is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

471
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:04,799
have any say in what the new voting

472
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,510
system looks like and<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are kind of</font>

473
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">freaking out about that and the</font>

474
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:10,230
Conservative Party has particularly gone

475
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,819
after this saying we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font>

476
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,829
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the voting system without</font>

477
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:15,720
holding a referendum it's only fair the

478
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,939
Canadians get to approve or deny the

479
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:19,559
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> and how they're gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let the</font>

480
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:20,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">next government otherwise it can be</font>

481
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:23,309
unfair undemocratic because it looks

482
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:24,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the Liberals are gonna pick a</font>

483
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:26,819
system that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to benefit them the</font>

484
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,590
most and<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously that makes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

485
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,450
uncomfortable because the Liberals could

486
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,500
be creating a system that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font>

487
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,049
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in power for most of forever so</font>

488
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:37,140
anyway the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Conservatives have said their</font>

489
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,549
tactic right now because they have the

490
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:39,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">they don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have enough seats in the</font>

491
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:41,010
House of Commons to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything about it</font>

492
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,080
is to hold up<font color="#E5E5E5"> any legislation that</font>

493
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,520
changes our electoral system in the

494
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,429
Senate our Senate is the worst it is

495
00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:48,000
full

496
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,280
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Old Party</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> activists and fundraisers</font>

497
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,830
and corrupt idiots who are not elected

498
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,750
who were appointed for life or until

499
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,980
they're 75 or 85 I forget and they're

500
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,650
generally regarded<font color="#CCCCCC"> as totally useless to</font>

501
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,720
have them hold up legislation is super

502
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,220
undemocratic and doesn't happen very

503
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,080
often so it's sort of a deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

504
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,490
devil here if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Conservatives</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

505
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,720
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> Senators try to hold</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it this</font>

506
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,880
legislation yeah it's good because

507
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,350
they're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to give us a democratic</font>

508
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,170
voice but they're also using a really

509
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,910
undemocratic and<font color="#E5E5E5"> shitty system to do it</font>

510
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,630
so yeah I don't I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the conservative</font>

511
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,460
senators will get on board and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and hold</font>

512
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,530
up legislation if it comes to that I

513
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,510
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think any much cajoling I think</font>

514
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is actually kind of the</font>

515
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,540
only thing the Senate it was supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

516
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">be used for was to ensure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

517
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,680
majority in the House of Commons can't

518
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,630
railroad<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of the country so i</font>

519
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,430
don't think the conservative party needs

520
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,080
to do much convincing<font color="#E5E5E5"> through their</font>

521
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,210
senators to try to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to actually</font>

522
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:46,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">hold this up all right well Ryan I hope</font>

523
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,480
we answered your question and Justin

524
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,650
that was certainly enlightening for me

525
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:53,280
and so hey we got two people<font color="#E5E5E5"> calling us</font>

526
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">on skype at the same time imagine that</font>

527
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,520
let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and say hey to Diana and</font>

528
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:02,480
Michelle hey hey how are you good good

529
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,380
so what questions do you have for us

530
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,650
today um so I have two questions for

531
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:10,530
either of you I just want to preface

532
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,900
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> by saying my parents were</font>

533
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,770
Vietnamese refugees and I think what um

534
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,710
Justin Trudeau's done is really great

535
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:22,080
but our plan to increase the number of

536
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,870
Syrian refugees we're taking in does

537
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">that affect how many refugees were</font>

538
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,580
taking in from other countries for

539
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,950
example there's a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> row hanga</font>

540
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">Muslims fleeing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Burma right now so does</font>

541
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">that affect immigration or the number of</font>

542
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,540
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fugees we can take from other parts</font>

543
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:44,640
of the world the short answer is yes but

544
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,570
no the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right answer is that yes it</font>

545
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,190
probably does I mean you're talking

546
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,170
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a department which is now</font>

547
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,120
completely overworked<font color="#E5E5E5"> that does not have</font>

548
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">enough staff to even deal with the</font>

549
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,510
25,000 we're trying to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> it right</font>

550
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,610
now they're totally overworked totally

551
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,830
overburdened it's a bit of a disaster

552
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,669
making it work they're doing a

553
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:04,070
spectacular job<font color="#E5E5E5"> All Things Considered</font>

554
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,210
but the government has basically said

555
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,769
we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to allow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this to affect</font>

556
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:11,279
quotas for other refugees so in practice

557
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:13,320
we should still on paper be taking in

558
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,090
the exact same number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of refugees anyway</font>

559
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,960
in addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the 25 thousand Syrians</font>

560
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,190
practically though it might mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

561
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,169
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not giving enough you know due</font>

562
00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:23,490
diligence to some of the other refugee

563
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,779
applications it might be a further

564
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:26,760
backlog I've spoken<font color="#E5E5E5"> to people who</font>

565
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically told me there's already a huge</font>

566
00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:30,779
waiting list that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting longer for</font>

567
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:32,460
permanent resident applications which is

568
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,380
unrelated to the refugee file all

569
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,330
together but simply<font color="#CCCCCC"> because there's so</font>

570
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,620
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people being diverted at</font>

571
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,809
Citizenship and Immigration Canada to

572
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:41,370
dealing with the Syrian refugee question

573
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,370
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else is sort of suffering so</font>

574
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:46,320
the actual effect might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be all that</font>

575
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,330
much it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> just be that some other</font>

576
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,620
refugees have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couple more</font>

577
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,169
months or that they are you know here in

578
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:53,789
Canada but are waiting longer and longer

579
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:55,500
to actually have a judgment<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the case</font>

580
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,019
so the actual effect might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

581
00:20:58,019 --> 00:20:59,610
tremendous but it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> look like there's</font>

582
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,559
gonna be something at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time the</font>

583
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:02,970
actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers of people coming in</font>

584
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,370
shouldn't change so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think it's</font>

585
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">gonna be you know a huge boon doggle or</font>

586
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,570
anything along those lines<font color="#E5E5E5"> but yeah but</font>

587
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:13,350
probably be some sort of impact thanks

588
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:16,169
and my second<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is about</font>

589
00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:19,440
pipelines um because our economy<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

590
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,169
based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources it seems like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

591
00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:24,899
necessary evil but<font color="#E5E5E5"> do we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know how he</font>

592
00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:26,970
will address land rights and

593
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,549
environmental the environmental costs

594
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:31,490
when we continue to rely on pipelines

595
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,919
well Trudeau's made this big kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

596
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,809
show about wanting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reform how we</font>

597
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:38,399
approve or deny pipelines in this

598
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:40,230
country which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good thing because</font>

599
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,880
the previous system was absolutely

600
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,769
horrible and it probably will still be

601
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:47,760
horrible but less horrible it didn't the

602
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,679
day the<font color="#CCCCCC"> prime minister still has a lot</font>

603
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,570
of authority to approve deny pipelines

604
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,850
kind of arbitrarily Trudeau said he

605
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,320
would support Keystone kind of no matter

606
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,570
what he said he would<font color="#E5E5E5"> oppose the</font>

607
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,940
Northern Gateway pipeline almost

608
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,639
absolutely though I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think he might</font>

609
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:04,860
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> reverse</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> herself on that either</font>

610
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,139
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new process is supposed to take</font>

611
00:22:07,139 --> 00:22:08,580
more into account environmental

612
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,020
questions as well as First Nations

613
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,450
rights whether or<font color="#CCCCCC"> not that's going to be</font>

614
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">sufficient is still kind of up in the</font>

615
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:14,940
air

616
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,320
lot of indigenous and aboriginal

617
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,090
Canadians have made the<font color="#CCCCCC"> case that you</font>

618
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:20,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">know there's going to be no you know</font>

619
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,190
reasonable pipeline system<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless it can</font>

620
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,200
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> bring in Aboriginal peoples</font>

622
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:29,100
its net for any pipeline project so it's

623
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,680
hard to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know that the first</font>

624
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,790
station<font color="#E5E5E5"> is ever gonna be happy with the</font>

625
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,470
system because it's already<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone so far</font>

626
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,330
along with whatever bringing them to the

00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only really three pipeline</font>

629
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,130
projects you've given the fact that

630
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,960
Keystone got it got rejected in the

00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">States there's only three pipeline</font>

632
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,740
projects on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the table</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it looks like</font>

633
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,030
at least one or two of them is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">go through you have energy East which</font>

639
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,850
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> through it's not the biggest</font>

640
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,320
project they're really just retrofitting

641
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,700
some other lines and adding a couple

642
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,250
extensions then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got a northern</font>

643
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,050
gateway which is supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring</font>

644
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,390
Alberta oil to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the northern coast of</font>

645
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,750
British Columbia that project<font color="#CCCCCC"> is almost</font>

646
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,190
certainly dead in the water there's so

647
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,570
much opposition to it it's such a

648
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:20,760
dangerous route to go I would be

649
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,840
surprised to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that ever actually</font>

650
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,160
happen and then you have the other one

651
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,900
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> named I'm forgetting because I</font>

652
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,430
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I haven't finished</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my third</font>

653
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,530
cup<font color="#CCCCCC"> of coffee today but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically it's</font>

654
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:34,740
twinning another pipeline it's going to

655
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,770
go through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> northern British Columbia</font>

656
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,880
there's a pipeline that already exists

657
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,750
they're just going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to increase the</font>

658
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,250
capacity for it they still have the

659
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,270
question of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're gonna get the</font>

660
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,550
oil out of British Columbia<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say China</font>

661
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:47,010
that's an open question right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now to be</font>

662
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,440
honest it feels like it's so far off in

663
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,760
the distance that any of these projects

664
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,100
is actually get done that we have no

665
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea what the price of oil is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

666
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,860
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get there so there's a lot of</font>

667
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,930
uncertainty in the energy<font color="#E5E5E5"> economy right</font>

668
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:00,090
now and there's not a lot of appetite to

669
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,220
start any new pipeline project so the

670
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,390
question might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be kind of answered</font>

671
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:06,920
before Trudeau ever actually address it

672
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">Thanks I have a question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about bill c-51</font>

673
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:13,110
it was such a hot election issue it's

674
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,120
all anybody was talking about and Justin

675
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,950
Trudeau kept saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Liberal</font>

676
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,720
government would repeal the bill when

677
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,060
they got in power it seems since then

678
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,740
there's really been no talk of it since

679
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,540
does he have any actual concrete plans

680
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,880
to do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so in the liberal</font>

681
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,200
platform they actually wall

682
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,730
through a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the amendments they</font>

683
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,049
want to make they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> increase</font>

684
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:33,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">oversight give members of parliament</font>

685
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,809
more ability to look at how CSIS and CSC

686
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,820
are two main spy agencies CSIS being the

687
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,860
one that does human intelligence and

688
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,779
spies on people you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a black</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> van</font>

689
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:44,880
outside your apartment and CSC is the

690
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">one that's listening to all your phone</font>

691
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:48,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">calls</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or reading your emails so between</font>

692
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:50,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">the two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them Justin Trudeau wants to</font>

693
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,330
create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a committee of parliamentarians</font>

694
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:54,139
to oversee how they actually spy on us

695
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:56,700
but he also wants to remove some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

696
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,799
aspects of c-51 this really broad

697
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,679
anti-terrorism legislation to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure</font>

698
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,059
that some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff in there is less</font>

699
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:04,799
crazily unconstitutional because almost

700
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,630
every constitutional scholar in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Canada</font>

701
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,669
looked at this bill and said like whoa

702
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:11,370
you that you can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's a</font>

703
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:14,090
section of the bill that says that CSIS

704
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:17,309
can apply to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> can basically do</font>

705
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:18,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">whatever it wants to disrupt a threat</font>

706
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:19,860
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

707
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,289
disrupt means but it could be anything

708
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:24,000
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know pouring you know sugar in</font>

709
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,070
your gas tank too I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

710
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,630
tying you up in a basement and leaving

711
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,399
you there we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know what</font>

712
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:30,539
they're actually allowed to do and

713
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:32,309
normally in this sort of thing you go

714
00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:34,740
okay well we have constitutional rights

715
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,559
and those can't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> broken except the</font>

716
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,750
bill said that if it's CeCe's agent goes

717
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,240
before a judge it can apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ignore</font>

718
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,010
our constitutional<font color="#CCCCCC"> rights which is not a</font>

719
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,120
thing they're allowed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't</font>

720
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,710
just say we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> ignore all your</font>

721
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,990
rights as a citizen that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some crazy</font>

722
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:51,029
nonsense so anyway Trudeau is going to

723
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:53,279
repeal that section that we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

724
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,169
what he kept saying but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's an</font>

725
00:25:55,169 --> 00:25:56,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting question because Trudeau is</font>

726
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,029
totally not the civil libertarian that's

727
00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:01,970
blood made him out to be he's still

728
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:05,070
supportive of the of c-51 generally he

729
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,659
was been supportive of other legislation

730
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:09,120
that allows say ceases to go abroad and

731
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">conduct missions overseas he's been</font>

732
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:14,580
supportive of legislation<font color="#E5E5E5"> that allows</font>

733
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,289
police to obtain our<font color="#E5E5E5"> data without a</font>

734
00:26:16,289 --> 00:26:17,549
warrant he's been supportive of

735
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:19,669
legislation<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> allow</font>

736
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:21,929
intelligence obtained via torture to be

737
00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:24,539
used in terror cases so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

738
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:26,010
some skepticism about what he actually

739
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,990
plans to do and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was actually I've</font>

740
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,519
spoken to some intelligence experts who

741
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:31,080
basically said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> his new system of</font>

742
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,960
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of oversight might actually result</font>

743
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,659
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> more spying because when you allow</font>

744
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:38,519
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Prime Minister or his ministers to</font>

745
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:40,649
have approval of these projects it might

746
00:26:40,649 --> 00:26:41,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">just lead to them saying</font>

747
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,970
s more often<font color="#E5E5E5"> whereas the previous system</font>

748
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,370
you know was more you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> more of a</font>

749
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,780
rules-based one where you didn't have

750
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know the minister sitting in a desk</font>

751
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,500
listening to a bunch of intelligence

752
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,030
agents pitch<font color="#E5E5E5"> them on some broad</font>

753
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,890
surveillance project instead you had a

754
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:56,180
system whereby the you know the prime

755
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,500
minister said you know I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

756
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,720
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you carte blanche to do this you do</font>

757
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,040
this and the courts<font color="#CCCCCC"> will decide whether</font>

758
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">or not it's legal it's not my job so</font>

759
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,910
it's a really interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> conundrum and</font>

760
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:05,990
I'll be actually really interested to

761
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">see what he actually does I expect</font>

762
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,110
there'll be some sort of legislation

763
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,570
coming forward probably by februari or

764
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,190
march that's gonna address a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

765
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,510
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions so we'll be watching</font>

766
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:18,080
that pretty closely great thanks awesome

Alberto rabbit I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering if the</font>

773
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,940
liberal party of canada will carry on

774
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,530
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> conservative party of canada's</font>

775
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,270
policies as they have for the past 30

776
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,800
years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm it kind of gave us a</font>

777
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,900
specific they're mentioning the fact

778
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,350
that Trudeau is actually suing the US

779
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:49,010
over the Keystone XL<font color="#CCCCCC"> pipeline denial so</font>

780
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,810
what do you think i will<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

781
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">Conservative Party</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually excuse me</font>

782
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,320
well the Liberal Party actually mean a

783
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,490
big departure for from the previous

784
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:00,410
policies okay well so true<font color="#CCCCCC"> know himself</font>

785
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:03,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">is not suing America under NAFTA over</font>

786
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,940
the Keystone decisions actually

787
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,980
TransCanada the pipeline company they're

788
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,140
the ones doing it Trudeau himself a

789
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,030
supportive of Keystone but you know he

790
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,170
doesn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the authority to sue them</font>

791
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:14,510
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that lawsuit is mostly for show that</font>

792
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,370
decision will actually come down<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

793
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,380
their five years or something absurd so

794
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,540
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> mostly a PR stunt more than an</font>

795
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,700
actual deagle challenge that's it

796
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,800
Trudeau has a lot in common with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

797
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,360
Conservative Party you know deliberately

798
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,560
true himself talks a good game on a lot

799
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,210
of kind of left knee issue that the left

800
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">really likes you know he's for</font>

801
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">legalizing marijuana you know he's kind</font>

802
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">of talks about state surveillance in a</font>

803
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,560
good way he talks good about the

804
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,090
environment first nations in the

805
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">environment or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two things that he's</font>

806
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,130
actually pretty progressive and

807
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,960
left-wing on so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually had some</font>

808
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,400
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good bona fides there except does</font>

809
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,840
support certain pipelines that have been

810
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,670
controversial on the other side though

811
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:54,770
Trudeau is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> always that left wing I</font>

812
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:55,640
mean his party

813
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,080
is not always a left-wing party his

814
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,880
party's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a centrist can be little</font>

815
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,170
right center right can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a little</font>

816
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:01,910
center left that's how the Liberal Party

817
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:05,360
has always kind of operated so you know

818
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,580
one good example is sex work you know

819
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,920
the liberal party a little party gets

820
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,930
associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> being against the most</font>

821
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,790
recent sex work legislation that

822
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,200
basically criminalized purchasing sex

823
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,000
work but Trudeau himself is actually

824
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,460
pretty supportive of that he criticized

825
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,870
the government about how they introduced

826
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,490
the legislation but he actually supports

827
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,560
criminalizing sex work it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

828
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,030
interesting dichotomy between how he

829
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,410
feels about marijuana versus I feel

830
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:30,110
about sex work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I think a</font>

831
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of folks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to be</font>

832
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,480
disappointed<font color="#E5E5E5"> when he comes out and</font>

833
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,060
really keeps defending the government's

834
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,290
legislation the previous government

835
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:39,410
legislation around prostitution there's

836
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,520
a whole bunch<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things like that</font>

837
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,420
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we're going to see a lot</font>

838
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,060
more of them in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the coming a couple of</font>

839
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">months but I think it also kind of</font>

840
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">depends on how he wants to what he wants</font>

841
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,890
to pursue as Prime Minister he's already

842
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:56,120
committed to a new legislation to expand

843
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,270
and promote LGBTQ rights new legislation

844
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,400
to help transgender people and so you

845
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,990
know if he decides to he<font color="#E5E5E5"> could spend</font>

846
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,910
four years doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> only super lefty</font>

847
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:07,520
progressive stuff but I think a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

848
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,720
the things they're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> thrown at him</font>

849
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,180
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see him essentially</font>

850
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,890
double down at some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the policies of</font>

851
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:15,830
Stephen Harper so I have a question I

852
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:18,200
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> when we're talking about you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

853
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">how different world Trudeau's Canada be</font>

854
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,280
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> harper's canada there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

855
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,740
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Harper did that made our</font>

856
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,900
country look pretty shitty and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

857
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,190
the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sticks out for me is a</font>

858
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:30,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">Canadian living abroad is that there's a</font>

859
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,880
law passed that said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you've</font>

860
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,740
lived outside of Canada for five or more

861
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,810
years you can no longer vote the last

862
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,760
election is the last one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I voted in</font>

863
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,460
so to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like that I mean</font>

864
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,440
can Trudeau do it is there an appetite

865
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,660
to specifically change that is that kind

866
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,070
of being swept under the rug I mean what

867
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:49,250
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think the best is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the best my</font>

868
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,360
knowledge is a constitutional challenge

869
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,540
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly act that voting question so</font>

870
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">well I kind of see maybe they might wait</font>

871
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:56,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">and see how that goes before they do</font>

872
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:59,000
anything that's it's a good question i

873
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know what Trudeau would do is</font>

874
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,810
specifically on that there's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> submit</font>

875
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:04,040
there's also misunderstanding about that

876
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,630
law<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically if you can still claim a</font>

877
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,220
residence<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Canada you're allowed to</font>

878
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,480
vote which a lot of people didn't

879
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,770
realize so if you're

880
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,240
parents to live in Canada<font color="#CCCCCC"> you consider</font>

881
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,530
that I guess secondary residents you're

882
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,270
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually able to vote as far as I</font>

883
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:16,130
know so there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people coming</font>

884
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,600
out saying I can't vote and then would

885
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,710
later find out that they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

886
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">to vote so unquestioned like that is</font>

887
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,400
interesting candidates standing in the

888
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,960
world is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those things that</font>

889
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,660
Canadians obsess about we always<font color="#E5E5E5"> freak</font>

890
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,430
out about how the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world sees</font>

891
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,140
us and we always with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> weirdly</font>

892
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,510
distorted view about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> important we</font>

893
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,010
are sometimes we think we're super

894
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,870
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> and weird you know cheering</font>

895
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,040
peace agreements and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

896
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,810
peacekeeping and then sometimes we kind

897
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,550
of get really down on<font color="#E5E5E5"> ourselves and</font>

898
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">think oh you know the world hates us now</font>

899
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,450
this the fact is Canada's reputation<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

900
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:46,520
the world hasn't changed in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 30 years</font>

901
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,920
people see us roughly now as they did

902
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">under the previous government center</font>

903
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,740
liberal conservative<font color="#CCCCCC"> government's past</font>

904
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,190
not allowed<font color="#E5E5E5"> has change and actually</font>

905
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,570
under Stephen Harper Canada had a pretty

906
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:59,120
left-wing foreign policy we went<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

907
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,020
the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> criticizing African states for</font>

908
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,370
you know maintaining horrible records

909
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:07,580
for human rights and LGBTQ rights we you

910
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,200
know slap around China when it came to

911
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,410
it we openly criticized a lot of

912
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:15,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">governments that you know the America or</font>

913
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:16,790
Europe wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> criticize we are also</font>

914
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:19,280
super hypocritical on some things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

915
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,810
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> criticize Saudi Arabia sometimes</font>

916
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:22,070
but keep selling them weapons other

917
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,380
times so there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> always a bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

918
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,640
cognitive dissonance about Canadian

919
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,010
foreign policy but Stephen Harper did a

920
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:31,040
relatively good job I mean you know he

921
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,760
worked aggressively to fund groups like

922
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,250
grassroots<font color="#CCCCCC"> guerrilla groups in Africa</font>

923
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,380
and the Middle East who were promoting

924
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,180
gay rights women's rights and various

925
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,610
other human rights causes so there's

926
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,050
there was good things happening there

927
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:48,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it's funny Trudeau now talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talks</font>

928
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,970
this big game about bringing Canada back

929
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:52,520
but the end result is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know he</font>

930
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,710
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be as vocal on some of these</font>

931
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:57,170
issues as Harper was we've already seen

932
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:00,530
him commit ardently to continuing

933
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:03,310
trading heavy weaponry to Saudi Arabia

934
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:07,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've seen him go to the Philippines and</font>

00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,100

942
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:23,460

00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,409

Iran kicked out the Iranian diplomats

961
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,750
here in Canada took our diplomats back

962
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,719
home and closed our embassy there and in

963
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:10,889

started seizing Iranian assets in Canada

965

and selling them off to help compensate

criticizing the Iranian government about

970
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:27,449
various human rights records and

971
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:29,760
basically called a spade a spade in the

election<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the new government</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in Iran</font>

00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,510
for us becoming buddies again with a
