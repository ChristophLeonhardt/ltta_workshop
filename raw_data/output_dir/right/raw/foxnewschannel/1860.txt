WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT

4
00:00:08,795 --> 00:00:09,997
DEMOCRATS HOPING FOR A BLUE

5
00:00:09,997 --> 00:00:10,497
WAVE IN NOVEMBER.

6
00:00:10,497 --> 00:00:11,999
WE ARE SEEING SIGNS IT COULD

7
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:13,367
BE MORE LIKE A RIPPLE.

8
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:15,302
TY MATSDORF IS THE FORMER

9
00:00:15,302 --> 00:00:17,671
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE

00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:20,941
2016 DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN

11
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:21,375
COMMITTEE.

AND COLIN REED IS A COLUMNIST

13
00:00:24,711 --> 00:00:28,115

14
00:00:28,115 --> 00:00:29,182
THANK YOU BEING HERE.

15
00:00:29,182 --> 00:00:30,050
THEY SAY MAKING THE

16
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,284
PREDICTIONS IN THE HOUSE THE

17
00:00:31,284 --> 00:00:32,586
DEMOCRATS WILL GAIN BETWEEN 25

18
00:00:32,586 --> 00:00:34,388
TO 30 SEATS IN THE HOUSE.

19
00:00:34,388 --> 00:00:35,355
AND COOK PREDICTS THAT

20
00:00:35,355 --> 00:00:36,990
DEMOCRATS WILL GAIN AS MANY AS

21
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,061
TWO SEATS IN THE SENATE.

22
00:00:41,061 --> 00:00:43,930
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE

23
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:44,431
PREDICTIONS?

24
00:00:44,431 --> 00:00:46,299
>> IT'S EARLY FOR THE

25
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:46,900
PREDICTIONS.

26
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:47,601
>> Dana: WE DON'T CARE ABOUT

27
00:00:47,601 --> 00:00:47,968
THAT.

28
00:00:47,968 --> 00:00:49,469
>> OF COURSE.

29
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:51,505
THERE IS A SAYING, "GOOD

30
00:00:51,505 --> 00:00:53,106
POLICY IS GOOD POLITICS."

31
00:00:53,106 --> 00:00:54,474
THIS WEEK REPUBLICANS HAD A

32
00:00:54,474 --> 00:00:55,876
GOOD WEEK.

33
00:00:55,876 --> 00:00:57,644
POLICY SIDE PRESIDENT HAD A

34
00:00:57,644 --> 00:00:59,012
TRIUMPH IN NORTH KOREA AS WELL

35
00:00:59,012 --> 00:01:00,047
AS THE IRAN DEAL.

36
00:01:00,047 --> 00:01:01,715
GETTING OUT OF THAT WILL FIRE

37
00:01:01,715 --> 00:01:02,182
UP HIS BASE.

38
00:01:02,182 --> 00:01:05,585
IN THE POLITICAL FRONT, CRISIS

39
00:01:05,585 --> 00:01:07,054
WAS AVERTED IN WEST VIRGINIA.

40
00:01:07,054 --> 00:01:08,855
WE HAVE A STRONG CANDIDATE TO

41
00:01:08,855 --> 00:01:10,857
CHALLENGE JOE MANCHIN AND THE

42
00:01:10,857 --> 00:01:11,758
BATTLEFIELD WILL SHIFT TO RED

43
00:01:11,758 --> 00:01:13,260
PART OF THE COUNTRY WHERE THE

44
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:13,960
REPUBLICANS HAVE STRONG

45
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,762
CHALLENGERS TO TAKE ON THE

46
00:01:15,762 --> 00:01:16,763
INCUMBENT DEMOCRAT SENATORS.

47
00:01:16,763 --> 00:01:17,497
>> Dana: TODAY THE PRESIDENT

48
00:01:17,497 --> 00:01:18,832
TALKING ABOUT LOWERING DRUG

49
00:01:18,832 --> 00:01:19,199
PRICES.

50
00:01:19,199 --> 00:01:21,168
ALSO WE HAVE THIS FROM NANCY

51
00:01:21,168 --> 00:01:21,501
PELOSI.

52
00:01:21,501 --> 00:01:22,903
LISTEN TO THIS ABOUT HOW SHE

53
00:01:22,903 --> 00:01:24,571
SAYS THE DEMOCRATS ARE WINNING

54
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:27,474
THE TAX WAR.

55
00:01:27,474 --> 00:01:30,777
>> THEY ARE LOSING THE PUBLIC

56
00:01:30,777 --> 00:01:31,411
RELATIONS SIDE.

57
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:32,212
THEY WON THE VOTE.

58
00:01:32,212 --> 00:01:33,780
THEY HAD THE VOTE.

59
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,182
THEY WON THE VOTE.

60
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:37,184
BUT THEY HAVE NOT WON THE

61
00:01:37,184 --> 00:01:38,952
PUBLIC OPINION OF IT BECAUSE

62
00:01:38,952 --> 00:01:40,153
THE EXPERIENCE THAT PEOPLE

63
00:01:40,153 --> 00:01:43,523
HAVE IS SOMETHING VERY

64
00:01:43,523 --> 00:01:44,357
CONTRARY TO THE

65
00:01:44,357 --> 00:01:45,058
MISREPRESENTATIONS THEY HAVE

66
00:01:45,058 --> 00:01:45,559
MADE ABOUT IT.

67
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:47,060
>> Dana: I WANT TO CHECK MY

68
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,829
GUT INSTINCT ON THIS WITH YOU.

69
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:50,864
SOMETHING TELLS ME MAYBE SHE

70
00:01:50,864 --> 00:01:51,798
KNOWS SOMETHING THAT

71
00:01:51,798 --> 00:01:53,233
REPUBLICANS DON'T.

72
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:54,501
>> I THINK THAT WHAT YOU ARE

73
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:55,702
SEEING IN POLLING IS THAT

74
00:01:55,702 --> 00:01:56,870
PEOPLE JUST AREN'T FEELING THE

75
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,771
EFFECTS OF IT.

76
00:01:57,771 --> 00:01:58,805
YOU HAVE REPUBLICAN OUTSIDE

77
00:01:58,805 --> 00:02:00,507
GROUPS SPENDING MILLIONS OF

78
00:02:00,507 --> 00:02:02,008
DOLLARS A WEEK TO TRY TO

79
00:02:02,008 --> 00:02:02,742
PROMOTE THE BILL.

80
00:02:02,742 --> 00:02:04,211
NOT GETTING ABOVE 50%.

81
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:05,612
I DON'T WANT TO BELITTLE

82
00:02:05,612 --> 00:02:07,147
PEOPLE'S PAYCHECK.

83
00:02:07,147 --> 00:02:09,049
$50, $100 MEANS A LOT TO A LOT

84
00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:09,883
OF PEOPLE.

85
00:02:09,883 --> 00:02:12,786
WHEN THEY SEE COMPANIES LIKE

86
00:02:12,786 --> 00:02:15,555
SHELDON ADELSON MAKING $1

87
00:02:15,555 --> 00:02:17,057
BILLION IN PROFIT IT SEEMS

88
00:02:17,057 --> 00:02:17,457
SKEWED.

89
00:02:17,457 --> 00:02:18,592
>> Dana: SO DO YOU THINK THE

90
00:02:18,592 --> 00:02:19,459
DEMOCRATS ARE SMART TO RUN ON

91
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:21,161
A MESSAGE LIKE WHAT SHE IS

92
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:22,462
SAYING TO ROLL BACK WHAT

93
00:02:22,462 --> 00:02:23,797
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ABLE TO GET

94
00:02:23,797 --> 00:02:28,235
DONE ON TAXES?

95
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:29,569
>> I THINK IT'S RIGHT.

96
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:30,470
PEOPLE'S POCKETBOOK WILL BE

97
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,304
THE ISSUE THIS CYCLE.

98
00:02:31,304 --> 00:02:32,539
IF YOU SAY THE REPUBLICANS

99
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:33,573
HAVE ALL THE POWER AND WHAT

100
00:02:33,573 --> 00:02:34,708
DID THEY DO?

101
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,543
THEY GAVE HUGE TAX CUTS TO BIG

102
00:02:36,543 --> 00:02:36,977
CORPORATIONS.

103
00:02:36,977 --> 00:02:38,712
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S MORE

104
00:02:38,712 --> 00:02:40,113
BALANCE TO FOCUS ON FOLKS LIKE

105
00:02:40,113 --> 00:02:40,480
YOU.

106
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,015
I THINK THAT IS A GOOD STRONG

107
00:02:42,015 --> 00:02:43,416
ECONOMIC ARGUMENT THAT WORKS

108
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,784
IN BLUE DISTRICTS, RED

109
00:02:44,784 --> 00:02:46,086
DISTRICTS, PURPLE DISTRICTS.

110
00:02:46,086 --> 00:02:46,920
>> Dana: IF PEOPLE ARE

111
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,488
FEELING LIKE THE ECONOMY IS

112
00:02:48,488 --> 00:02:50,157
BETTER, YOU SEE THE RIGHT

113
00:02:50,157 --> 00:02:51,324
TRACK, WRONG TRACK NUMBERS

114
00:02:51,324 --> 00:02:52,926
IMPROVING FOR THE REPUBLICANS

115
00:02:52,926 --> 00:02:53,560
AND FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP.

116
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,995
THEY ARE FEELING GOOD ABOUT

117
00:02:54,995 --> 00:02:56,663
FOREIGN POLICY.

118
00:02:56,663 --> 00:02:57,764
THE PRESIDENT'S POLL NUMBERS

119
00:02:57,764 --> 00:02:58,265
ARE RISING.

120
00:02:58,265 --> 00:02:59,833
ARE THE DEMOCRATS GOING TO BE

121
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:00,967
PREPARED TO DEAL WITH IT IF HE

122
00:03:00,967 --> 00:03:03,303
ACTUALLY GETS ABOVE 50%?

123
00:03:03,303 --> 00:03:04,905
IT LOOKS LIKE HE WILL HAVE A

124
00:03:04,905 --> 00:03:05,772
GOOD SUMMER.

125
00:03:05,772 --> 00:03:06,973
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S ANY

126
00:03:06,973 --> 00:03:08,508
SURPRISE TO ANYONE WHO STUDIED

127
00:03:08,508 --> 00:03:10,610
NANCY PELOSI SHE WANTS TO

128
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,478
RAISE TAXES.

129
00:03:11,478 --> 00:03:13,113
IT'S MORE PERPLEXING SHE WOULD

130
00:03:13,113 --> 00:03:14,814
ANNOUNCE IT TO THE WORLD TO

131
00:03:14,814 --> 00:03:18,418
GIVE HER POLITICAL OPPONENTS

132
00:03:18,418 --> 00:03:20,787
WHAT TO USE AGAINST HER.

133
00:03:20,787 --> 00:03:21,955
PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE HIGHER

134
00:03:21,955 --> 00:03:22,389
TAXES.

135
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:23,423
>> Dana: LET ME ASK YOU

136
00:03:23,423 --> 00:03:24,157
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE THAT

137
00:03:24,157 --> 00:03:25,325
HAPPENED TODAY THAT YOU TOLD

138
00:03:25,325 --> 00:03:26,860
ME ABOUT TODAY.

139
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,894
THE FEDERAL ELECTION

140
00:03:27,894 --> 00:03:29,162
COMMISSION, F.E.C., MAKING A

141
00:03:29,162 --> 00:03:29,963
BIG ANNOUNCEMENT.

142
00:03:29,963 --> 00:03:31,464
I WANT YOUR TAKE ON IT.

143
00:03:31,464 --> 00:03:34,067
THEY SAID THIS IS A

144
00:03:34,067 --> 00:03:36,670
CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE

145
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,071
GRANISURELY ON THE CHILD CARE

146
00:03:38,071 --> 00:03:39,439
BATTLE SAYING WE WON, THANK

147
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:44,177
YOU TO THE COMMISSIONERS FOR

148
00:03:44,177 --> 00:03:45,879
THE UNANIMOUS VOTE TO USE THE

149
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:46,713
FUNDS FOR CHILD CARE.

150
00:03:46,713 --> 00:03:48,114
THIS IS A GAME CHANGER FOR

151
00:03:48,114 --> 00:03:50,016
WOMEN AND PARENTS CONSIDERING

152
00:03:50,016 --> 00:03:50,817
A RUN FOR OFFICE.

153
00:03:50,817 --> 00:03:52,619
HOW BIG OF A DEAL OF THIS IF

154
00:03:52,619 --> 00:03:53,787
YOU ARE TRYING TO RECRUIT

155
00:03:53,787 --> 00:03:54,754
YOUNGER PEOPLE TO RUN FOR

156
00:03:54,754 --> 00:03:55,222
OFFICE?

157
00:03:55,222 --> 00:03:56,022
>> THIS IS HUGE.

158
00:03:56,022 --> 00:03:57,924
WHEN PEOPLE ARE ASKED TO RUN

159
00:03:57,924 --> 00:03:59,125
FOR OFFICE OFTENTIMES THEY

160
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,227
GIVE UP THEIR JOB AND THEY

161
00:04:00,227 --> 00:04:01,094
CAN'T WORK FULL TIME.

162
00:04:01,094 --> 00:04:02,395
IF YOU THINK VIRGINIA TEN, ONE

163
00:04:02,395 --> 00:04:05,232
OF THE MOST CONGRESSIONAL

164
00:04:05,232 --> 00:04:05,599
DISTRICTS.

165
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,333
FEW YOU A YOUNG FAMILY YOU PAY

166
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,468
UP TO $5,000 A MONTH FOR CHILD

167
00:04:08,468 --> 00:04:08,768
CARE.

168
00:04:08,768 --> 00:04:11,404
IF YOU USE THE CAMPAIGN FUNDS,

169
00:04:11,404 --> 00:04:13,873
WE SHOULD LOWER THE BARRIER.

170
00:04:13,873 --> 00:04:16,076
NOT BEING PERSONALLY WEALTHY

171
00:04:16,076 --> 00:04:18,144
SHOULDN'T KEEP YOU FROM

172
00:04:18,144 --> 00:04:18,511
RUNNING.

173
00:04:18,511 --> 00:04:20,279
AND IT SAYS SOMETHING THEY

174
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:20,981
APPROVED THIS.

175
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:22,015
>> Dana: ARE YOU SURPRISED

176
00:04:22,015 --> 00:04:23,183
BY THIS?

177
00:04:23,183 --> 00:04:24,217
>> A RARE MOMENT TO HAVE A

178
00:04:24,217 --> 00:04:25,218
BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT THAT THIS

179
00:04:25,218 --> 00:04:27,254
IS A GOOD THING.

180
00:04:27,254 --> 00:04:28,221
MORE WOMEN RUNNING FOR OFFICE

181
00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:29,990
IS GOOD FOR BOTH PARTIES AND

182
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,458
LOWERING THE BARIER FOR WOMEN

183
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,759
WHO WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN

184
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,761
POLITICS IS A GOOD THING.

185
00:04:34,761 --> 00:04:36,129
>> Dana: HAD THIS BEEN

186
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:37,030
CHALLENGED BEFORE?

187
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,364
>> YEAH.

188
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:39,165
IN 1995, THERE WAS A MALE

189
00:04:39,165 --> 00:04:41,601
CANDIDATE WHO ASKED TO USE

190
00:04:41,601 --> 00:04:42,869
CHILD CARE WHEN HIS WIFE

191
00:04:42,869 --> 00:04:44,571
TRAVELED WITH HIM.

192
00:04:44,571 --> 00:04:45,839
BUT LET'S BE HONEST.

193
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:47,774
IN 2018, MEN WORK, WOMEN WORK.

194
00:04:47,774 --> 00:04:49,009
THIS BENEFITS ANYBODY THAT HAS

195
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:49,876
A YOUNG FAMILY.

196
00:04:49,876 --> 00:04:50,510
>> Dana: INTERESTING.

197
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,778
I ALSO WANT TO ASK ABOUT

198
00:04:51,778 --> 00:04:52,479
CALIFORNIA.

199
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,481
I'M FASCINATED BY THE JUNGLE

200
00:04:54,481 --> 00:04:55,081
PRIMARY SITUATION.

201
00:04:55,081 --> 00:04:58,118
AND THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE SO

202
00:04:58,118 --> 00:04:59,719
MANY CANDIDATES RUNNING THAT

203
00:04:59,719 --> 00:05:01,054
THEY COULD SPLIT THE VOTE SO

204
00:05:01,054 --> 00:05:02,555
MUCH THAT THE TOP TWO

205
00:05:02,555 --> 00:05:03,323
VOTE-GETTERS COULD BE

206
00:05:03,323 --> 00:05:04,791
REPUBLICANS AND THE DEMOCRATS

207
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:05,625
COULD BE BOXED OUT.

208
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,527
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?

209
00:05:07,527 --> 00:05:07,861
>> LOOK.

210
00:05:07,861 --> 00:05:08,928
THIS IS A BIG CHALLENGE FOR

211
00:05:08,928 --> 00:05:10,397
THE DEMOCRATS THIS CYCLE.

212
00:05:10,397 --> 00:05:11,831
USUALLY ENTHUSIASM AND TOO

213
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:13,033
MUCH ENTHUSIASM, YOU CAN'T

214
00:05:13,033 --> 00:05:13,433
HAVE ENOUGH.

215
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:14,701
BUT THIS IS ONE CASE LOOK, I

216
00:05:14,701 --> 00:05:17,971
SAW YESTERDAY ON THE SHOW YOU

217
00:05:17,971 --> 00:05:19,005
WERE TALKING ABOUT IT.

218
00:05:19,005 --> 00:05:20,273
YOU HAVE TO PICK A HORSE AND

219
00:05:20,273 --> 00:05:21,541
TRY TO GET THEM THROUGH.

220
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:22,509
>> Dana: CAN THE REPUBLICANS

221
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:23,276
EXPLOIT THIS?

222
00:05:23,276 --> 00:05:24,411
>> I AGREE WITH TY.

223
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:25,879
THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM FOR

224
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:26,313
DEMOCRATS.

225
00:05:26,313 --> 00:05:26,880
>> Dana: WHAT CAN

226
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,248
REPUBLICANS DO TO TRY TO FIX

227
00:05:28,248 --> 00:05:28,748
IT?

228
00:05:28,748 --> 00:05:29,516
>> CALIFORNIA IS ALWAYS GOING

229
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:30,850
TO BE TOUGH SLEDDING, NO

230
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,152
MATTER WHAT AND HOW GOOD A

231
00:05:32,152 --> 00:05:32,519
YEAR.

232
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,421
BUT I THINK THAT THE PATH TO

233
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:36,122
THE HOUSE DEMOCRAT MAJORITY

234
00:05:36,122 --> 00:05:37,424
HAS TO INVOLVE CALIFORNIA.

235
00:05:37,424 --> 00:05:38,958
IF THEY ARE LOSING ONE OR TWO

236
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,226
SEATS THERE, THAT IS ONE OR

237
00:05:40,226 --> 00:05:41,861
TWO SEATS NOT GOING TOWARD THE

238
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:42,529
TOTAL THEY NEED.

239
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:44,431
IT COULD BE A BIG PROBLEM.

240
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:45,565
>> Dana: GETTING BACK TO THE

241
00:05:45,565 --> 00:05:46,366
TOPIC OF THE DAY.

242
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:47,434
DRUG PRICES.

243
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:48,968
HOW BIG OF A DEAL IS THAT FOR

244
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:51,104
THE CONSTITUENTS AND WHAT ARE

245
00:05:51,104 --> 00:05:52,339
THEY LOOKING FOR, IF THE

246
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:54,240
PRESIDENT OR THE DEMOCRATS?

247
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,574
>> SURE.

248
00:05:54,574 --> 00:05:57,477
LOOK, DRUG PRICES ARE ALWAYS

249
00:05:57,477 --> 00:05:58,812
AN ISSUE ESPECIALLY IN MIDTERM

250
00:05:58,812 --> 00:06:00,547
ELECTION THAT IS USUALLY OLDER

251
00:06:00,547 --> 00:06:00,947
ELECTORATE.

252
00:06:00,947 --> 00:06:02,048
PEOPLE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN

253
00:06:02,048 --> 00:06:03,350
DRUG PRICES AND PAYING FOR

254
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,117
FOOD UNFORTUNATELY.

255
00:06:04,117 --> 00:06:05,018
IT'S ALWAYS AN ISSUE.

256
00:06:05,018 --> 00:06:06,219
I THINK THEY WANT REAL

257
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:06,586
SOLUTIONS.

258
00:06:06,586 --> 00:06:07,821
THERE IS NO SILVER BULLET

259
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:08,121
HERE.

260
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:09,222
THIS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE FOR

261
00:06:09,222 --> 00:06:10,590
YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS.

262
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,025
I THINK THAT THEY ARE GOING TO

263
00:06:12,025 --> 00:06:13,326
BE SUSPICIOUS OF ANYBODY THAT

264
00:06:13,326 --> 00:06:14,561
SAYS I HAVE THE MAGIC KEY.

265
00:06:14,561 --> 00:06:16,963
IT HAS TO BE A COMPREHENSIVE

266
00:06:16,963 --> 00:06:17,397
APPROACH.

267
00:06:17,397 --> 00:06:18,331
>> Dana: COULD IT BE

268
00:06:18,331 --> 00:06:18,998
PRESIDENT TRUMP BECAUSE HE

269
00:06:18,998 --> 00:06:21,401
DOESN'T COME WITH THE USUAL

270
00:06:21,401 --> 00:06:22,736
WASHINGTON, D.C. BAGGAGE

271
00:06:22,736 --> 00:06:23,803
AROUND THE ISSUE COULD BLOW IT

272
00:06:23,803 --> 00:06:25,071
UP AND START OVER?

273
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:26,139
>> SEEING HIM IN THE ROSE

274
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:27,273
GARDEN TODAY SHOWS HE IS

275
00:06:27,273 --> 00:06:28,842
MAKING A SERIOUS ISSUE AND HE

276
00:06:28,842 --> 00:06:30,210
DOESN'T COME FROM A

277
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,578
PARTICULARLY CONFINED SET OF

278
00:06:31,578 --> 00:06:32,412
POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES.

279
00:06:32,412 --> 00:06:34,080
MAYBE IT WILL GIVE HIM

280
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,081
FLEXIBILITY TO DO INTERESTING

281
00:06:35,081 --> 00:06:35,482
THINGS.

282
00:06:35,482 --> 00:06:36,416
>> Dana: IT'S INTERESTING.

283
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,817
IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE POLLING

284
00:06:37,817 --> 00:06:39,486
ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT

285
00:06:39,486 --> 00:00:00,000
MOST, WHAT THE CONCERNS ARE,
