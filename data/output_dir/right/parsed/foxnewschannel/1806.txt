LIKE, ARTHEL.
ARTHEL: ABSOLUTELY, WE WAIT WITH
ANTICIPATION.
GARRETT TENNEY THANK YOU.
ERIC.
ERIC: WE ARE JOINED BY
AMBASSADOR, SAUDI ARABIA'S
AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED
NATIONS, MR. AMBASSADOR,
WELCOME, THANK YOU FOR COMING IN
TODAY.
>> THANK YOU, PLEASURE TO BE
HERE.
ERIC: LET'S START WITH THE
CRITICS, THEY SAY THIS WAS
ILL-ADVISED OF THE PRESIDENT TO
PULL OUT, PROVOCATIVE AND IRAN
HAS BEEN ABIDING BY THE DEAL, IE
HAS REPEATEDLY SAID THAT AND
THIS PREVENTS IRAN FROM GETTING
NUCLEAR WEAPON?
>> THEY HAVE BEEN ABIDING BY THE
DEAL BECAUSE THE DEAL IS FLAWED
AN ONE-SIDED IN THEIR FAVOR THAT
THE DEAL GAVE IRAN EVERYTHING
THEY WANTED, COMPENSATION
$150 BILLION THAT THEY COULD USE
FOR THEIR ACTIVITIES IN THE
MIDDLE EAST AND SO FORTH AND DID
NOT CHECK IRAN'S DEVELOPMENT OF
BALLISTIC MISSILES, ITS EXPORTS
OF BALLISTIC MISSILES AND LOOK
AT THE REGION IN THE PAST TWO OR
THREE YEARS, SYRIA IS MUCH MORE
IN PLACE THAN EVER BEFORE, THEY
ARE FUELING THE ACTIVITIES OF
THE HOUTHIS IN YEMEN, SO WHY
WOULDN'T THEY STICK WITH THE
DEAL, WHY WOULDN'T THEY ABIDE BY
THE DEAL?
IT'S A GOOD DEAL FOR THEM.
ERIC: YOU THINK IT WAS
ONE-SIDED?
>> IT WAS BASICALLY FLAWED.
IT WAS DEEPLY FLAWED.
IT WAS THROUGH AD THROUGH -- FLA
IT WAS THROUGH AD THROUGH -- FLE
IT WAS THROUGH AD THROUGH -- FLD
IT WAS THROUGH AD THROUGH -- FLI
IT WAS THROUGH AD THROUGH -- FLN
IT WAS THROUGH AD THROUGH -- FLT
IT WAS THROUGH AD THROUGH -- FLE
IT WAS THROUGH AD THROUGH -- FLS
IT WAS THROUGH AD THROUGH -- FLN
IT WAS THROUGH AD THROUGH -- FLE
IT WAS THROUGH AD THROUGH -- FLI
IT WAS THROUGH AD THROUGH -- FLN
MORE THAN ONE WAY.
FIRST, IT GAVE IRAN A LEGITIMATE
PATH TOWARDS NUCLEARIZATION ALL
BE ET IT A FEW YEARS LATER AND 5
YEARS IN HISTORY IS 5 SECONDS.
SECONDLY, BECAUSE IT DID NOT
ADDRESS THE OTHER ISSUES THAT
ARE CONCERN TO THE WORLD AND THE
REGION, FINANCING TERRORISM,
ACTIVATING REBEL MOVEMENTS,
ARMING HEZBOLLAH, SUPPORTING
BASHAR AL-ASSAD AND SO FORTH, SO
A LOT OF ISSUES THAT WERE VERY
IMPORTANT TO THE REGION AND THE
WORLD WERE SIMPLY NOT ADDRESSED.
ERIC: THE CROWN PRINCE HAS
CALLED THE AGREEMENT LIKE 1938
MUNICH AGREEMENT WITH THE NAZIS.
HOW FEARFUL ARE YOU, HOW
CONCERNED ARE YOU ABOUT IRANIAN
INTENTIONS?
>> WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT
IRANIAN INTENTIONS, THEY ARE
CLEAR, THEY DO NOT -- THEIR
OBJECTIVE IS TO CONVERT MANY OF
THE MUSLIM COMMUNITIES IN THE
WORLD, THEY HAVE USED OLD
TENSIONS BETWEEN SHIITES AND
SUNNIS.
WE HAVE BEEN LIVING FOR HUNDREDS
OF YEARS.
MADE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT TO
EXPORT REVOLUTION AND IDEOLOGY.
WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CONCERNED
WITH THAT AND WE HOPE THAT ONCE
THE WORLD TAKES STAND, ONCE THE
WORLD DRAWS THE RED LINE ON --
ON THESE ISSUES THAT IRAN --
ERIC: YOU SAW PRIME MINISTER IN
CHINA AND HE'LL BE GOING TO
EUROPE NEXT WEEK TRYING TO LOBBY
FOR THE DEAL.
WHAT WOULD YOU TELL EUROPEAN
ALLIES LIKE GERMANY, FOR
EXAMPLE, THE NATION THAT IS DEAL
WITH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM
TEHRAN, WHAT WOULD YOU TELL
THEM?
>> I WOULD TELL THEM THAT HAS
NICE WORDS BUT STILL REPRESENTS
THE SAME REGIME THAT HAS BOMBED
BERLIN, THAT HAS BOMBED MUNICH,
THAT FUEL IT IS WAR IN SYRIA AND
IN LEBANON, INSTABILITY IN YEMEN
AND IN IRAQ AND OTHER PLACES, SO
THIS IS THE MOMENT OF TRUTH FOR
OUR EUROPEAN FRIENDS, THEY
EITHER TAKE THE SIDE OF SAYING
LET'S CORRECT THIS ONCE AND FOR
ALL OR THEY TAKE THE SIDE OF
APPEASEMENT IN WHICH CASE WE
WOULD HAVE MORE YEARS OF THE
SAME IRANIAN BEHAVIOR.
ERIC: DO YOU REALLY SEE THEM
GIVING UP ALL OF THE RICH THAT
IS THE EUROPEAN COMPANIES GET BY
DEALING WITH TEHRAN AND BEING
ABLE TO TRADE UNDER THIS DEAL
WHICH MAY NOW AS WE HEARD FROM
JOHN BOLTON COULD BE POTENTIALLY
IN DANGERED IF THE U.S. IMPOSES
MORE STRICTER SANCTIONS?
>> SAUDI ARABIA IS LARGEST
ECONOMY IN THE MIDDLE EAST, IF
YOU'RE TALKING BENEFITS AND
DEALS AND SO FORTH, THERE'S NO
OTHER PLACE TO LOOK AT OTHER
THAN SAUDI ARABIA AND THE REST
OF THE -- AND THE UNITED STATES,
BUSINESS PARTNER FOR MANY
EUROPEAN COMPANIES.
IF IT'S A MATTER OF CHOICE WHERE
INTERESTS ARE, THE CHOICE IS KEY
WHICH IS WITH THE SIDE OF
ABORTING AND ABANDONING THE
DEAL.
ERIC: DO YOU THINK OR HOPE THAT
AN ECONOMIC STRANGULATION OF
TEHRAN COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO
THE FALL OF THAT REGIME?
>> WELL, THE FALL OF THE REGIME
OR NOT IS THE BUSINESS OF
IRANIAN PEOPLE BUT SENDING A
MESSAGE, STRONG MESSAGE THROUGH
ECONOMIC SANCTIONS THROUGH OTHER
POLITICAL AND MORAL SANCTIONS I
THINK IS WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE
TO COMMUNICATE TO THE IRANIAN
PEOPLE THAT THIS REGIME IS
LEADING THEM IN THE WRONG
DIRECTION AND THEN IT'S UP TO
THEM TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO ABOUT
IT.
ERIC: FINALLY ANOTHER ISSUE THE
HISTORIC MOVE OF THE UNITED
STATES EMBASSY FROM TEL AVIV
FROM SINCERELY YOURS, LEEM THAT
WILL OCCUR TOMORROW.
THE KINGDOM HAS NOT SUPPORTED
THAT, WHAT IS YOUR VIEW AND WHAT
ARE YOU HOPING FOR POTENTIAL
PEACE WITH THE PALESTINIANS?
>> WELL, THIS MOVE IS
UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE IT IS
PROVOCATIVE, NOT SENSITIVE TO
THE FEELINGS AND ASPIRATIONS OF
THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE AND IT
WAS UNNECESSARY AND UNTIMELY AT
THIS STAGE.
JERUSALEM IS FINAL ISSUE, SHOULD
BE NEGOTIATED BETWEEN THE TWO
SIDES AND THE CONCLUSIONS
REACHED WOULD BE ADOPTED AND
ACCEPTED BY THE ENTIRE WORLD.
TO MAKE THIS MOVE AT THIS POINT
OF TIME SIMPLY PUTS THE UNITED
STATES ADMINISTRATION FIRMLY ON
ONE SIDE AND INHIBITS THE
EFFORTS THAT ARE BEING MADE
TOWARDS REACHING A PEACEFUL
SOLUTION.
JERUSALEM SHOULD BE THE CAPITAL
STATE, THE CAPITAL CITY FOR TWO
STATES AND SHOULD BE A PART OF
FINAL STATUS NEGOTIATION.
ERIC: FINALLY, WHEN IT COMES TO
IRAN AND DEALING WITH TEHRAN AND
THE REGIME, YOU ARE ON THE SAME
PAGE WITH WASHINGTON?
>> WELL, WE DEFINITELY ARE
BECAUSE WASHINGTON IS IN THE
PAGE OF RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY.
ERIC: OR WASHINGTON IS IN THE
PAGE OF RIYAHD TOO.
