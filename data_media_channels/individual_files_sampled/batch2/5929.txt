President Trump had ignored requests for comment about the senator three different events yesterday morning and afternoon at the White House let me just play you a little of that mr. president do many thoughts on John McCain to have any thoughts at all about John McCain to to belief John McCain was a hero sir nothing at all about John McCain mr. president the American Legion has asked you to lower the flags to half-staff any reaction to the American Legion thank you any action to the American Legion asking you put a proclamation about John McCain why would you say very much on McCain Katelyn Huey burns he wouldn't say anything about John McCain do we know anything about what led to ultimately him at least seem to be reading a statement a brief statement about John McCain right 48 hours after the Senators death and remember that the the Senators family released a statement on Friday saying he was ending treatment so the White House had ample time to prepare for this and this is representative of course of that long-standing grudge that the president has with this there have been reports that many people in the White House were upset with this and wanted of course the news coverage yesterday was all about Trump's refusal at that point to lower the flags or say anything in his honor and the narrative was becoming the story was becoming about Trump which is even in this day and age remarkable and yeah and this is a surprise to anybody this is a long-standing feud these two men have had and yet when one of them is in his final days and then dies then you would like to think that what has happened in the past with presidents of both sides as being that they are the leader when a country clearly as they are now is in mourning it's worth reminding folks what President Trump has said about Senator McCain in the past listen the way Trump looks at it he's at least better than everyone else in the race beginning with John McCain a little bit I mean he was captured and he flew combat missions justice being captured make you a hero I don't know I'm not sure he's not a war hero he's a war he's a war hero cuz he was captured I like people that weren't captured okay governor does this the statement that the president made last night makes sense to you is it inconsistent or is it something that thank God he finally did it well it's thank God he finally did it it was obvious he was dragged kicking and screaming and I agree with what Caitlyn said I think it was general Kelly as chief of staff that moved them to finally do it and and Lindsey Graham actually on the Today Show kind of indicated how great John Kelly has been to the family calling them offering them whatever assistance they wanted that that that relationship the sort of the White House relationship has been very good and very respectful that's right and and and I think a lot of the staff the White House has been very respectful and responsive but this is a story because McCain is a you know a national treasure this is going to be memorials in the capital in the White House in Arizona this is going to be another week and if the president hadn't defused that somewhat I think it's defused but it's still going to be out there it would have been the major narrative and you know the thing the thing about John McCain I mean he is a great icon my very brief remembrance of him we were joining lawmakers was his great temper he used to get mad so obviously we were at an Indian parade once I got ahead of him I thought he was going to take my head off but that's what made him so competitive so great you know he was somebody that really stood up for our values and you know I think the president's remarks were gracious but it was about time he you should just put aside these grudges you know the I mentioned that that his very very very close friend Lindsey Graham was on The Today Show this morning and he said it's look it's the president's right to feel any way he wants to about John McCain but Senator Graham was also asked about another strained relationship that has been very much in public that's between President Trump and his attorney general Jeff Sessions he said something really fascinating take a listen to this this relationship is beyond repair I think but Senator Graham I mean the only beef the president seems to have against him is that he's not going to get rid of the investigation wouldn't you president finish the second part it's much deeper than that what else what are we missing well we won't say on this show but it's a it's a pretty deep breach and here's what I'm suggesting that he's not the only man in the country that can be Attorney General a pretty deep breach Caitlin has there been talk about this do you have any idea what he might be referencing here interestingly last week when Graham was asked about this on Capitol Hill he was saying that sessions might be ousted after the election after the midterms the president has obviously expressed his frustration with Jeff sessions over months and months and months but yet every time the White House is asked whether the president still has confidence in his attorney general they say that there are no announcements to make at this time there is a question about how long this can go on but you are hearing from a very defiant Jeff Sessions issuing that statement last week that was very striking he also had rod Rosenstein out there in public expressing confidence in the Moller investigation so I'm waiting to see what the reaction is among Republicans who have often said that they won't have the appetite to confirm someone in his place and that this would create somewhat of a real political crisis for the hesitation chrissa's that the Senate won't confirm anybody other than sessions I think they don't have time they don't want to go through it he's an ex senator so the president's kind of in a box and I think what he's hoping for is the sessions on his own resigned and he's not going to do it like she said that statement very clearly I'm in charge I've been in charge since day one okay hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC
