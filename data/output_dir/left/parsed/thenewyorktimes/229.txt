Imagine a CSI investigation 
— this famous TV program —
where the investigators
don’t have the murder weapon,
don’t have the place, don’t
have access to the victims.
How the hell do you
investigate that?
It's impossible!
(Narrator) Late 2016, Havana.
(in background) Dr. Rosenfarb, are you aware
of any type of technology
that would cause this?
No, I’m not, sir.
American diplomats
were complaining
of crushing headaches,
extreme fatigue.
Who would do this?
And an intense sound.
Secretary Tillerson ordered
the departure of
non-emergency personnel...
The Cubans?
They said they knew
nothing about it.
Sporadic attacks
continued until late April.
But that sound is
why this building
is nearly empty at this
important moment for Cuba.
For the first time in 60 years,
its leader will not be a Castro.
Two things we know for sure.
Here’s what the US government
has said about the sound.
People were hurt, and the Cuban
government knows who did it.
Whatever happened
to these people
happen as a result of some
sophisticated technology that,
quite frankly, is
so sophisticated we
don’t understand it.
It leads to then —
In Washington, Senator Marco
Rubio convened a hearing.
Was the early opinion of
the security professionals
who looked at it that it was
likely a form of harassment.
OK.
In late 2016, staff at the
United States Embassy in Havana
began complaining
of strange noises,
and among the descriptions
that they complained of,
high pitched beam
of sound or just
intense pressure in one ear.
There are 24 Americans, who
during their time in Havana,
have experienced symptoms
that are consistent with what
you have seen in mild traumatic
brain injury and/or concussion.
Doctors said that diplomats’
brain matter had actually
changed.
What started out as a
mysterious nuisance —
We know it happened
to 24 people —
— became a suspected
instrument of attack.
Tillerson reacted as
he would have reacted
when he was an oil executive.
He heard something
happen in an oil rig.
Get everybody out of there.
Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson ordered his staff.
We are convinced these
were targeted attacks.
We don’t like our
diplomats being targeted.
Depart your post, he said.
Leave Cuba.
And they did.
Everyone from the people
who discussed trade down
to those who processed visas.
The incident had
become political.
This is entirely about the
health, and the safety,
and the well-being of Americans.
We still have an
investigation that’s underway.
So I hope Cuba would focus
instead on helping us
with the investigation and be
less concerned about claiming
this is political.
So here the contrast,
the contrast which is —
Carlos Alzuguray was a
Cuban diplomat for decades.
He’s a bit of an unofficial
government spokesperson.
Why throw down the embassy?
The bad thing about it is
that probably the guys who
have been affected more
are the regular Cubans, not
the government.
By the time the diplomats
left, the warming
started by President Obama
had undeniably chilled.
The US issued a travel
advisory, and tourism dropped.
On the streets of
Havana, the idea
that Cuba was involved
in a sonic attack
was met with skepticism.
It wasn’t long after the
incident became public
that sound experts
began downplaying
the idea of a sonic attack.
Sound can’t easily change brain
matter, among other reasons.
You’ve got a long, long
way to go before you even
attribute this to sound.
It’s not going to
cause physical effects.
If the sound goes through
air before reaching you,
it’s not going to cause that.
As I said, you can’t —
It may have been a
situation where people were
drawn more closely together.
It wasn’t only the sound
experts who struggled
to explain what happened.
Infectious cause is
what I would say.
Engineers also tried.
It could have just
been a malfunctioning
ultrasonic device, perhaps
used for some other nefarious
purpose.
And psychologists.
Well, these people
were on an island.
Fears can spread
in a tight group.
Things can get more intensified.
Anything is possible.
A microwave expert.
If you direct a
beam of microwave,
the microwave would
produce an acoustic wave.
This doctor said it could
have just been a virus.
An infection of some type.
So ultrasonic weapon
is not science fiction.
I could build one.
I can put it in the house
of somebody I didn’t like,
and I could annoy them.
What really seems
science-fiction is the idea
that you could build an
ultrasonic rifle that
will shoot 100 meters and
target somebody, and shoot
through a wall and get
just that one person.
Dr. Leighton was
referring to this hotel,
where some diplomats
reported hearing the sound.
Look up.
It’s unlikely you could
direct a weaponized sound
wave across this street 11
stories up through walls
and windows and hit
individuals repeatedly
without anyone noticing.
The US wouldn’t share
any evidence of an attack
with the Cubans.
So they did their
own investigation.
For reference, 140 decibels is
about the sound of a plane’s
jet engine at takeoff.
You ask what we think is
that some people are ill,
and there was a
psychogenic contagion.
And other people
started reporting
that they were feeling ill.
These are English
speaking communities
that are relatively isolated
from the Cuban population.
They live among themselves.
They exchange.
And any kind of
anxiety or stress —
Doctor Sosa is
referring to mass hysteria,
a psychological condition.
There was no, quote
unquote, attack.
This theory is actually
the current official Cuban
standpoint.
Today, the lights are
on at the embassy,
but the doors remain locked.
The administration’s
reaction to all of this
is so drastic to make permanent
the drawdown of the US embassy
to ridiculously low,
unnecessary levels, which
has an element of spite to it.
Fulton Armstrong is a former
CIA analyst who covered Cuba.
He made a career in
searching for motives.
They were so desperate
to make their case
that it was sonic attacks.
This is serious stuff.
You’re accusing them of
doing line of sight attacks
with a weapon that
no one knows exists.
So once the political
people got stuck
in their own internal
contradictions,
it was almost
impossible, then, to get
a real serious discussion
of what was going on.
The administration
had already decided
it was going to use it, the
legitimate symptoms of US
government officials for
a political maneuver that
looks like a lot of
other political things
that this
administration has done.
And that is, at any cost,
undo what the predecessor did.
There are a number of people
in the administration, and some
in Congress, who didn’t want to
see normalization of relations.
So for those who
didn’t like the policy
changes by President
Obama’s administration,
it’s worked out pretty well.
You have the State
Department work
practically all the major
executive jobs have not
been covered.
It’s the perfect situation
for someone like Marco Rubio
to hijack a policy and push.
And so it leads you to conclude
that the Cuban government
either did this, or
they know who did it.
And they can’t say.
Marco Rubio got his way.
Sometimes, in US politics,
the strongest voice
is the voice that
predominates even when
the bureaucracy isn’t with you.
Whoever did this —
The bureaucracy has
allowed the political voice
to come in and dictate
a lot, including
analysis of the so-called
sonic attacks issue.
And then it leads you down
the road of motivation.
It makes you start to
think, who would do this?
Who would do this?
Someone who doesn’t
like our presence there,
and someone who wants there
to be this sort of friction
between the US.
So who would be motivated
to create friction?
Or who would not be in
favor of an increased US
presence in Cuba?
We don’t want to be
in this position.
We have no choice.
We cannot send Americans
into Foreign Service
and their relatives to a country
where their safety cannot be
guaranteed.
Senator Rubio, a
son of Cuban exiles,
has been a longtime critic
of the Castro government.
He’s always been an opponent of
reestablishing ties with Cuba.
Now, I’m not under
any fantasy that Cuba
is going to transition
from one day to the next
and turn into
Canada, but there has
to be progress in
that direction.
And there’s never been a step
in that direction to the extent
that they’ve taken these steps,
they’ve been largely cosmetic.
And they’ve retreated from
some of those positions.
So who would be motivated
to create friction?
Or who would not be in favor
of an increased US presence?
Maybe it was a third country.
Which third country would
want to disrupt the US
presence there?
And the logical conclusion
is Russia and Vladimir Putin.
Has the State Department raised
attacks against US personnel
in Cuba with the
Russian government?
That’s a very good question.
I think it would be better
to address that issue
in a classified setting.
Why would the fact
or lack of existence
of a communication to
the Russian government
be something that we
can’t discuss in public?
To give you the full
reply would be required,
and I believe that would be more
appropriate in the classified
setting.
Has Raul Castro ever said to
any US diplomat I didn’t do it,
but it’s possible
that some of my guys
did it without me
knowing about it?
I do not believe that
communication has ever
occurred.
You don’t want to discuss
something that is not
in a proper setting, or
is that just you’re —
you’ve just never heard?
That is my recollection
that I’ve never heard that.
OK.
The meeting is adjourned.
The US has still not given
an official explanation
of the sound or
its intent, if any.
But its effect has
been to play a big part
in the current
disengagement with Cuba.
This is happening
at a pivotal moment.
Raul Castro is stepping
down, and Miguel Diaz-Canel
will likely be president.
The notion that we have
just a skeletal staff
at the embassy,
fewer people than we
had during the
time of isolation,
is just unconscionable.
Well, the transition is not —
I mean, it’s a one
party transition.
I mean the outcome's
not in doubt.
You know, you would love to see
a new generation of leadership
that begins to move in
the right direction,
and I think those moves would be
reciprocated by American policy
makers.
But it’s not going
to happen because
of a unilateral
American opening.
That was the flawed
thinking behind the opening
towards China, and China
today is no more democratic
and no more free than it was.
And that was not the experience
in the aftermath of the Obama
opening.
It did not lead to any
changes in governance
or on the economic condition
of Cubans in the big picture.
After more than five
very difficult decades,
the relationship
between our governments
will not be
transformed overnight.
What are we doing?
We’re pulling out of the game.
They would prefer
to buy American rice
and American chicken.
They would prefer to
have Americans come down
and do travel in Cuba.
They like us.
But if we’re going to
treat them in the way
that we’re treating them, they
will make their own future
without us.
They say they’ve been making
their future for the last 60
years without us, and
they’re prepared to do it,
perhaps with some hyperbole,
for another 60 years.
