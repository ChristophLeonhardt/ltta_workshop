a lot of people instead of unknowingly and unwittingly endorsed these policies you know they're sold to the public with sort of harmless sounding names like flag broken windows or community policing sometimes it'll sound a little tougher don't come in a package but that they sell with terms like zero zero tolerance policing but most people when they hear broken windows or stop and frisk or stop question and frisk or community policing what they the image that they conjure in the in their minds is a beat cop going out into the community meaning people getting to know people by names they think it's they have a positive connotation with those kinds of policies but indirect the reality is if you talk to again if you if you talk to black and Hispanic citizens about what their experience with those policies means they'll have a very different description than white people will I mean if you I asked people in Tompkinsville and Staten Island where a car nerd I'd like to talk to me about their stop-and-frisk experiences and you know the first person I talked to says yeah I was driving my bike home from school one day cops jumped out of a squad car knocked me off my bike they emptied my my book bag on the ground they left me sitting on the sidewalk and they got back in their squad car didn't even help me up that's that's a stop-and-frisk to a black New Yorker now a white New Yorker is certainly not going to think of it that way you know so there's this huge dichotomy there I mean literally in this studio I've been to Santa Monica here in Los Angeles a million times never even thought about having the issue with the police but somebody on the crew here happens to be black and was a Santa Monica riding their bicycle almost in the exact same analogy that you used and the cops pull them over and what are you doing here arrest and etc for no reason no reason at all and so it's these two different Americas are mad not only because one side gets treated so unjustly but also because the other side is completely oblivious to it if you look at cities like New York and New York is like the crucible of all policing innovations going back to the last half-century what's the classic formula for getting elected mayor of New York City it's a social liberal we stuff on crime all right so upscale white voters love people like Mike Bloomberg who's an enthusiastic proponent of gay marriage but also says you know that he's a he's a big supporter of the police department and and there's an art you know supporter of programs like stop and frisk and so yeah white voters I think on one level they say yes we we want the social liberalism we don't want to feel like we're going for you know for reach for regressive policies but we also like our property values right we don't want to have to have to worry that the coop that we bought for a million dollars is not going to be worth nine hundred and twenty thousand because there's crime in my neighborhood so crime is a big issue it's a it's a coded issue and it's it was a incidentally a huge issue in the death of Eric garner the place where he was killed you know a decade ago you wouldn't have been able to find a cop in that neighborhood now there's a string of new expensive condominiums across the street and there are cops there every day so this is on some level yeah I think white America is kind of okay with a lot of these policies because deep deep down inside what they don't want is they they just want to keep those neighborhoods separated
