00:07:29,553 --> 00:07:31,188
ACCORDING TO THE REPORTING ON THE PRESIDENT’S GUARANTEE TO

273
00:07:31,188 --> 00:07:32,890
THE PRESIDENT’S GUARANTEE TO THEM THAT HE HAD DONE NOTHING

THEM THAT HE HAD DONE NOTHING WRONG.

275
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,926
WRONG. SO THEY RESPONDED, GREAT, YOU’VE

276
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,694
SO THEY RESPONDED, GREAT, YOU’VE DONE NOTHING WRONG.

277
00:07:36,694 --> 00:07:39,997

278
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,433
THE BEST WAY TO BRING THIS TO A QUICK TERMATION WOULD BE FOR YOU

QUICK TERMATION WOULD BE FOR YOU TO BE COMPLETELY OPEN.

280
00:07:44,368 --> 00:07:46,804
TO BE COMPLETELY OPEN. SO WHEN ROBERT COSTA REFERS TO

281
00:07:46,804 --> 00:07:48,305
SO WHEN ROBERT COSTA REFERS TO DON McGAHN PROTESTING THIS

282
00:07:48,306 --> 00:07:50,374
DON McGAHN PROTESTING THIS SXROECH PERMITTING McIGAN

00:07:50,374 --> 00:07:52,409
SXROECH PERMITTING McIGAN HIMSELF TO BE INTERVIEWED BY

284
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:55,413
HIMSELF TO BE INTERVIEWED BY MUELLER, IT IS BECAUSE McGAHN AS

285
00:07:55,445 --> 00:07:56,147
MUELLER, IT IS BECAUSE McGAHN AS WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL REPRESENTS

286

WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL REPRESENTS NOT THE PRESIDENT BUT THE

NOT THE PRESIDENT BUT THE PRESIDENCY.

288
00:07:57,915 --> 00:07:59,583
PRESIDENCY. SO HE WAS THINKING ABOUT THE

289
00:07:59,617 --> 00:08:01,385
SO HE WAS THINKING ABOUT THE LEGAL PRECEDENT THIS WOULD SET

290
00:08:01,385 --> 00:08:04,388
LEGAL PRECEDENT THIS WOULD SET GOING FORWARD, WHERE FUTURE

291
00:08:04,388 --> 00:08:04,922
GOING FORWARD, WHERE FUTURE PROSECUTORS, FUTURE

292
00:08:04,922 --> 00:08:06,724
PROSECUTORS, FUTURE INVESTIGATORS, WOULD SAY, WELL,
