Superman faster than a speeding bullet more powerful than a locomotive able to leap tall buildings with a single bound is still no match for angry feminists on twitter using the hashtag me to movement to completely devour any man that doesn't kneel before them I've been to hey this is pure Hollywood Henry Cavill was enjoying being on top of the world the leading man in a huge franchise a respected persona and traveling the world everything was going great until Clark Kent decided to go visit the land down under and give an interview that sent Twitter mobs in a frenzy the GQ interview with Superman said quote cavil was asked what he learned from the hashtag me too movement were in I know there have been situations with people I've worked with being perhaps over familiar with some of the actresses but I've always walked up to them and said hey are you alright that's creepy he went on to say but it's such a delicate and careful thing to say because there's flirting which for example in a social environment is in context and is acceptable and that has been done to me as well in return there's something wonderful about a man chasing a woman there's a traditional approach to that which is nice I think a woman should be wooed and chased and maybe I'm old fashioned for thinking that that sounds about right since calve was brought in a pretty traditional environment he's been an ambassador for the Royal Marines charity since 2014 and members of his family have served or are serving in the military currently which is probably where the Man of Steel got some of his training for the new Mission Impossible Fallout movie which is gonna be awesome but anyway no training your superhuman gifts or any match for the Kryptonite like outrage of people on Twitter who have no idea what they're talking about and his response was unacceptable yeah I may be on Krypton being decent and respectful to a woman you have interest in while also standing up for when a guy would step in and be overly friendly is seen as decent but here on earth we progressed far past those outdated values everyone is encouraged to treat sex and their bodies like the ferris wheel at a County Fair know even better there's not even any differences between the sexes themselves and if for some reason you don't like the degenerate culture created by the belittling of sex why don't we have the explicit rules to fix that you know like not making eye contact for longer than five seconds that'll fix it and being sure to speak up in a man flirts with a woman if the woman does not want to be flirted with but remember men and women are exactly the same so it's really just anyone that comes up and talks to you in general but until that's resolved Twitter and the media have spoken and Superman must apologize and this incredible force proved to be even too great for the Man of Steel who had to release an apology for his statements where he said absolutely nothing wrong we can only hope that the last Son of Krypton will return and continue to treat women with respect and stand up for them when others try to harass them you know be a good guy just like he said he was if you haven't done it already you can now download the rebel media app that way you have access to the entire rebel lineup and can take it with you wherever you go you
