00:00:35,122 --> 00:00:40,895
VIEWERS OF SWAMP WATCH.

16
00:00:40,895 --> 00:00:43,430

40
00:02:03,143 --> 00:02:04,144
TIED TO IT.

41
00:02:04,144 --> 00:02:07,014
IN RESPONSE TO ALL OF THIS THE

42
00:02:07,014 --> 00:02:11,352

43
00:02:11,352 --> 00:02:12,853

AND THE CHIEF OF STAFF.

47
00:02:19,626 --> 00:02:24,898
SECRETARY ROSS FULLY DIVESTED IN

48
00:02:24,898 --> 00:02:27,935

49
00:02:27,935 --> 00:02:30,037

THEY HAVE NOT FOUND SEX 232 TO

00:02:44,418 --> 00:02:49,056
HAVE A DIRECT AND PREDICTABLE

57
00:02:49,056 --> 00:02:50,691
PRACTICE.

58
00:02:50,691 --> 00:02:52,393
ADDITIONNALLY WENDY RESIGNED

59
00:02:52,393 --> 00:02:54,628
PRIOR TO BECOMING CHIEF OF

61
00:02:55,529 --> 00:02:57,264
RIGHT, A FEW POINTS HERE.

62
00:02:57,264 --> 00:02:59,400
THIS ONLY REFERS TO DIVESTMENT

63
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,536
OF ONE OF THE TWO COMPANIES.

64
00:03:02,536 --> 00:03:05,039
SECONDLY, HERE IS THE WEBSITE

65
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:07,307
WERE SUCH DIVESTMENTS SHOULD BE

66
00:03:07,307 --> 00:03:07,708
LISTED.

67
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:13,847
THE LATEST TRANSACTION WAS

68
00:03:13,847 --> 00:03:14,448
NOVEMBER 2017.

69
00:03:14,448 --> 00:03:17,384
THIS WAS AN UNRELATED COMPANY.

70
00:03:17,384 --> 00:03:25,159
NO TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN POSTED

71
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:25,492
SINCE.

72
00:03:25,492 --> 00:03:26,927
WE STATED CLEARLY TONIGHT IF

73
00:03:26,927 --> 00:03:28,829

00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:30,230
DIVESTMENT SHOW IT TO US.

75
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,666
WE HAD A WEEK AND WE WILL

HAPPILY SHOW OUR VIEWERS.

77
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:44,411
NAME REMAINS LISTED AS DIRECTOR

78
00:03:44,411 --> 00:03:47,648
AT NORTIC SHIPPING.

79
00:03:47,648 --> 00:03:49,683
SECRETARY ROSS' OFFICE SAID

80
00:03:49,683 --> 00:03:52,086
QUOTE MOST OF THIS REPORT IS

81
00:03:52,086 --> 00:03:55,722
BASED ON HALF TRUTHS AND

82
00:03:55,722 --> 00:03:57,858
ASSUMPTIONS THAT DON'T MAKE

83
00:03:57,858 --> 00:03:58,158
SENSE.

84
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:06,567
BOTH MR.  HILTON BOTH WORK ON

85
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:06,867
SHIPS.

86
00:04:06,867 --> 00:04:08,769
THE SHIPMENT NOTES A FRACTION OF

87
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:09,603
THE USE.

88
00:04:09,603 --> 00:04:11,305
THEY HOLD A SMALL PERCENT

89
00:04:11,305 --> 00:04:13,574
INTEREST IN A FUND THAT HAS

90
00:04:13,574 --> 00:04:14,842
PARTIAL FUNDS.

91
00:04:14,842 --> 00:04:17,377
NOTE, THE SECRETARY'S OWN

92
00:04:17,377 --> 00:04:20,012
STATEMENT CONFIRMS THE CENTRAL

93
00:04:20,012 --> 00:04:21,415
CONFLICT OF INTEREST HERE.

94
00:04:21,415 --> 00:04:23,550
WITH ONE HAND WILL BETTER ROSS

95
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:28,622
OWNS A COMPANY THAT SHIPPED

96
00:04:28,622 --> 00:04:32,259
SOUTH KOREAN STEEL TO THE U.S.

97
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:34,061
WILBER ALSO ADDED THE SECRETARY

98
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:37,197
WILL IMPLEMENT THE PRESIDENT'S

99
00:04:37,197 --> 00:04:39,366
BOLD TRADE AGENDA AND RIGHT THE

100
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:42,136
WRONGS AGAINST OUR AMERICAN

101
00:04:42,136 --> 00:04:42,469
WORKERS.

102
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:44,371
LET ME REPEAT.

103
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:47,808
I AM ALL FOR SUCCESSFUL AND

104
00:04:47,808 --> 00:04:51,445
EXPERIENCED BUSINESS PEOPLE LIKE

105
00:04:51,445 --> 00:04:53,580
WILBER ROSS SEVERING IN

106
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,715
GOVERNMENT.

107
00:04:54,715 --> 00:04:56,383
WHAT'S NOT GOOD IS WHEN THEY

108
00:04:56,383 --> 00:04:59,653
HIDE BEHIND SWAMPY ETHICS RULES

109
00:04:59,653 --> 00:05:01,255
THAT A CHILD COULD PROVE.

110
00:05:01,255 --> 00:05:03,390
THEY ARE CLAIMING THIS DOESN'T

111
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,026
EFFECT A COMPANY THAT IMPORTS

112
00:05:06,026 --> 00:05:06,326
STEEL.

113
00:05:06,326 --> 00:05:10,063
YOU COULD ARGUE WHAT CONSTITUTES

114
00:05:10,063 --> 00:05:11,398
THE SHIPMENT BUT YOU ARE STILL

115
00:05:11,398 --> 00:05:12,199
SHIPPING STEEL.

116
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,235
THEY ALSO ARGUE POTENTIAL OIL

117
00:05:15,235 --> 00:05:16,637
SANCTIONS DON'T EFFECT THE

118
00:05:16,637 --> 00:05:21,008
COMPANY THAT SHIPS OIL FROM

119
00:05:21,008 --> 00:05:21,375
VENEZUELA.

120
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:24,344
THIS IS THE LEGALISTIC B.S. WE

121
00:05:24,344 --> 00:05:26,547
GOT FROM CROOKED CLINTON.

122
00:05:26,547 --> 00:05:29,082
WHEN YOU SEVER IN THE

123
00:05:29,082 --> 00:05:31,318
ADMINISTRATION THAT DRAINS THE

124
00:05:31,318 --> 00:05:31,618
SWAMP.

125
00:05:31,618 --> 00:05:35,055
WE EXPECT A HIGHER STANDARD.

126
00:05:35,055 --> 00:05:39,693
SOME SUGGEST WE MADE A MISTAKE.

127
00:05:39,693 --> 00:05:42,196
ROSS' INTEREST ARE IN A BLIND

128
00:05:42,196 --> 00:05:42,496
TRUST.

129
00:05:42,496 --> 00:05:44,164
WE LOOKED INTO THAT AND THAT'S

130
00:05:44,164 --> 00:05:45,199
NOT THE CASE.

131
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,136
THIS IS ROSS' ETHICS AGREEMENT.

132
00:05:49,136 --> 00:05:51,438
THIS IS WERE ANY RELEVANT BLIND

133
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:52,873
TRUST WILL BE LISTED.

134
00:05:52,873 --> 00:05:55,909
IT NEVER MENTIONED ANY BLIND

135
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:56,210
TRUST.

136
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,911
THE OFFICE OF GOVERNMENT ETHICS

137
00:05:57,911 --> 00:05:58,845
IS A JOKE.

138
00:05:58,845 --> 00:06:01,582
IT ALLOWED BILL CLINTON TO MAKE

139
00:06:01,582 --> 00:06:03,584
MILLIONS IN SPEAKING FEES WHILE

140
00:06:03,584 --> 00:06:07,554
HIS WIFE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE.

141
00:06:07,554 --> 00:06:09,389
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SECRETARY

142
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:11,391
HANDED OUT A $10 MILLION GRANT

143
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:15,629
TO A COMPANY COCHAIRED BY HER

144
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:15,996
OWN COVET.

145
00:06:15,996 --> 00:06:17,931
DRAIN THE SWAMP WAS ONE OF

146
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:21,802
DONALD TRUMP'S MOST IMPORTANT

147
00:06:21,802 --> 00:06:25,672
PROMISES.

148
00:06:25,672 --> 00:06:28,275
WE'LL HOLD EVERYONE TO INTEREST.

149
00:06:28,275 --> 00:06:30,010
WE'LL GET TO THAT ON ANOTHER

150
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:30,310
NIGHT.

151
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,946
IN THE MEANTIME, A MASSAGE IT

152
00:06:32,946 --> 00:06:33,247
WILL.

153
00:06:33,247 --> 00:06:37,618
BY THE WAY WE REPEATEDLY

154
00:06:37,618 --> 00:06:38,118
INVITED.

155
00:06:38,118 --> 00:06:41,755
SECRETARY ROSS, YOU KNOW

156
00:06:41,755 --> 00:06:41,788
SECRETARY ROSS, YOU NNOW

157
00:06:41,788 --> 00:06:42,356
SECRETARY ROSS, YOU NOOW

158
00:06:42,356 --> 00:06:42,689
SECRETARY ROSS, YOU NO BETTER

159
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:44,491
THEN MOST THERE IS A CLEAR

160
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:44,992
STANDARD.

161
00:06:44,992 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU REDUCE
