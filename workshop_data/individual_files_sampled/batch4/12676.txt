if this is Keaton Jones and the viral video that we're all so yesterday why why finding a way to make do okay now this is on the one hand it's heartbreaking to watch this little kid crying about being bullied obviously there's something I think in all of us that just hates bullies there's bullies are just the the worst we we know we feel righteous anger toward them sometimes people don't understand when they're being the ones being bullied so all these people on the left or saying yeah stand up to bullies and by the way if you don't want to do exactly what I say I'm gonna shut down your business or I'm gonna shut down your cake shop or I'm gonna shut down your your florist shop but it's heartbreaking it's heartwarming it's not exactly Man Bites Dog you know kids get bullied all the time that's that's a fact of elementary school in middle school it isn't going to change I don't think but okay that's fine it's very nice as a result of this video going viral every single celebrity on earth I believe responded to offer support so snoop diggity Doo dat tweeted say little man you got a friend in me for life hit me on DM so we can chop it up love is the only way to beat hate very nice the UFC says hey Keaton Jones you have friends here at the UFC buddy today and always stand with Keaton then Donald J Trump jr. said this boy is incredibly brave and the video really got me Dana White if he takes you up on your offer to see UFC headquarters I would be honored to host him and his family at our place if they need somewhere to stay Chris Evans stay strong Keaton don't let them make you turn cold I promise it gets better while those Punk's at your school are deciding what kind of people they want to be how would you and your mom like to come to the Avengers premiere in LA next year that's pretty nice that sounds pretty good Katy Perry says this broke my heart today please be kind to one another Mark Ruffalo little buddy I was bullied as a kid you're right it gets better you are my personal superhero you got a pal in the Hulk Monica Lewinsky said Keaton I'm so sorry you're being treated this way you don't deserve an ounce of pain they'd be lucky to be friends with you it gets better I'm not going to make any jokes about that obviously there are many Ryan Seacrest said Keaton Jones your curiosity and kindness will overcome this moment and bring you many better days to come Enrique Iglesias heartbreaking to see this keaton you're strong to say these things and care so much for others team Keaton I can't go I mean obviously I was a lot there are like hundreds more there's so many of these so it was a little strange it was a little strange that every single person with a blue checkmark started tweeting I'd send out a little tweet about being bullied I think everybody feels some empathy bit for this because everyone gets bullied and most people bully too and that's just a fact of being elementary school and middle school we have seen this viral culture before it looks like it's accelerating though someone started a GoFundMe campaign that's where you you crowd crowd fund you raise money online they started a GoFundMe for this kid it raised fifty five thousand dollars I for what what what are they raising the money for I don't know what what is the kid gonna spend fifty five thousand dollars on he's like nine years old or something but they fund it because we just feel we feel bad for the kid we what can I do I can give him money I can click I can hashtag that's all that's all that we can do I don't even know if the kid's gonna get money I don't think the guy is connected to his family so anyway it's a little weird but it's clearly self-indulgent whatever it's nice who cares but of course we had to destroy it we had to destroy this poor kid so they found a photo all of these internet people found a photo of Keaton's mother standing next to a Confederate flag one or two photos of this he's a kid from Tennessee there were Confederate flags around so the left pounced tarik nasheed I actually couldn't see this tweet because he blocked me one time I tweeted his own words at him and he blocked me for it but I did see this in news coverage to reconize she'd who I'm not convinced isn't just a right-wing troll by the way but anyway prominent lefty treat me she says that viral video of Keaton Jones talking about being bullied is heartbreaking and I feel sympathetic toward that child but his mom Kimberly on the other hand is a suspected racist who makes a very problematic posts bullying black protestors didn't make problematic posts she was standing next to a Confederate flag people interpret that however they like but she wasn't bullying people she's I don't know what it means to be a suspected racist I know we've got you're under investigation Bob Muller has been appointed to see if you're you're really a racist I doesn't mean a whole lot but anyway the more lefties pounced on this it is the brutal consequence of social media culture and slacktivism we just need more clicks so you know when you when you post something on Facebook or Twitter you do get a dopamine rush you think oh well people like this oh I got a light great oh I'll get another one get another retweet and and those highs and those lows have to go more quickly and more quickly and they have to be more extreme and more extreme so what used to be a very long news cycle has now become a 24-hour news cycle has now become an 8 hour news cycle and it all switches over at cuts both ways to the mother exploited her child and put him on the internet and made him go viral and people are at now exploiting this child further because we have to talk about it it's a cultural event it's a it's a sympathetic story but then we need a villain we need somebody to tear down that this story was too nice without it they did this to ken bone I don't know if you remember ken bone back during the 2016 presidential debates there was a nice-looking man and a red sweater with a moustache and he became an instant celebrity here's Ken bone what steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs while at the same time remaining environmentally-friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers so he became a meme because he just looks sort of silly he looks like a cartoon character so they really liked him he's so respectful during the debate yes a serious question he looked hopeful and so anyway he became instafamous after he appeared on television with the candidates but but it was too nice we can't have that what that bat-cycle gets old after a day or two so now we have to make him into a villain someone on reddit found out that he had committed two egregious crimes one he had looked at the widely published naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence and that I think that makes him the only man in America to ever look at the completely ubiquitous nude photos of one of the most beautiful and famous celebrities in the world I think it's really off it's unbelievable that they would let that man back out in public so he did that and also he posted something on reddit and said that perhaps it wasn't murder for George Zimmerman to kill Trayvon Martin perhaps it was in self-defense some of the evidence showed that perfectly reasonable and so he became a villain and his reputation was destroyed just as quickly as his fame came about former Facebook executives have been admitting just this effect this came out today former Facebook vice-president for a user growth Chamath poly hot bhatia I'm sure I butchered that said he feels quote tremendous guilt for creating tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works he went on quote the short-term dopamine driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works no civil discourse no cooperation misinformation miss truth this is not about Russian ads this is a global problem it is eroding the core foundations of how people behave by in between each other Facebook's founding president Sean Parker criticized the company the same way he said it quote exploits a vulnerability in human psychology by creating a social validation feedback loop to discuss that and much more we will have to bring on our panel of deplorable z but first before we bring on our panel don't forget our third episode of the

Federalist Ariel Davidson and we have from the Daily Caller amber Athey and all-female panel of deplorable z Thank You Lord Ariel social media allows conservatives to crack the mainstream media monopoly on information and get their views out there isn't that a good thing I think so yes what happens is social media tends to turn people into keyboard warriors and so I think there's a sense of boldness that can sometimes be helpful but more often than not can be extremely inflammatory so I think there is a give-and-take when it comes to social media it's definitely been a way for people to exit their bubble but it's also been a way for people to reinforce their bubble you know now that you can share in your blockless on twitter or you can also do some facebook choose friend someone or to unfriend them be somebody really close I think it does sort of reinforce our perception of a worldview which is why you know when Donald Trump was elected there was sort of a collective meltdown on the left and I think a lot of that was because social media had created this false sense of how where political opinions lie in the world you know and that can be somewhat dangerous so I think in some ways social media can do more harm than good especially when it's used to sort of bolster again these keyboard warriors and people that take to Facebook and Twitter to get their political anger out instead of having a face-to-face conversation there is that aspect the unfriending phenomenon is really strange to me there have been another number of studies that show that people on the Left are much more likely to unfriend or disconnect from you on social media if you're a conservative than vice-versa than conservatives doing it to lefties and I think the reason for that is because lefties have never heard anybody contradict their opinions they preach tolerance and diversity and they're shocked to find out that anybody disagrees with them but for the other aspect of that is that we are not we're more than our political opinions people are more than our political opinions so if you sit and have dinner with somebody and you find out they voted for crooked Hillary that dirty rotten felon and my third cousin if I saw that on Facebook I might just ignore that person or look away or unfriend them or something but in person you have to talk to them and it might be interesting different perspectives make the world much more beautiful they make the world more interesting and they help you think about what you really believe a lot of that kind of disappears on social media that said CNN would not give me a show CNN is never going to give me a show and if if these new media didn't exist we wouldn't have a platform now amber if social media have made our culture faster more knee-jerk more hysterical is there any way back from here or or we just headed for even tighter news cycles oh gosh that's a really hard question um I don't see it really getting that much better I hate to be a pessimist but the more that I've been on social media it seems like the more angry people get the more political they get I remember being on Facebook back in high school and it was just about sharing prom pictures and you know posting cat gifs and now it's like everybody is sharing a political opinion it's all about getting those imaginary points from your friends or your followers everybody on Twitter is seeing who is the next person that I can drag and then within 24 hours they're on to the next evil villain like we saw in the Keaton case so it's definitely really dangerous that I think it's great that more people have a platform to express themselves in ways that they couldn't before but as Marielle was saying at the same time it can really bolster sort of a almost bullying where people are constantly able to attack anybody that they want any time and it really piles on when there's so many other people who are there to join in on the crusade and it's obviously been formulated it's been meticulously arranged these technology so that you will keep going back and you'll keep clicking and you'll keep tweeting and you'll keep piling on whoever it that aspect on psychologies is probably not very healthy but the effect on politics seems to be quite healthy could you imagine a world in which we had an administration like president Trump's excellent conservative policy legislation of nominations cultural battles from the NFL to political correctness to the news media could you ever imagine that without Twitter Donald Trump's appeal his great strength is is with Twitter it may be the case that it has bad psychological effects but politically I'm I'm not I'm not sick and tired of winning yet I'm not try to convince me that I am won't happen okay we have more shameless exploitation of children to get to with Jimmy Kimmel we've got to talk about the slut shaming shaming the slut slut shaming I don't know one of those between laia Wafaa and kirsten gillibrand but if you don't subscribe to The Daily wire we can't make that happen sorry folks if you go to daily wire.com right now you can subscribe it's $10 a month or $100 for an annual membership and you will get me you'll get the inter Clavin show you got the Ben Shapiro show you can submit questions to the conversation forget all of that none of that matters this is the thing guys the leftist tears tumblr I drink I drink many beverages out of it I drink coffee tea obviously I pour whiskey in my morning coffee but what is really suited for those salty and delicious left is tears that you see around you all day and every day during the Trump administration so make sure you go over there right now you can have them hot or cold always salty and delicious we'll be right back speaking of the shameless exploitation of children here is Jimmy Kimmel parading his six son around to make an inaccurate political point they each gave a full day of their very busy lives to give me time off and I'm grateful to them for doing that and daddy cries on TV but Billy doesn't I don't know what could be more disgusting than putting a tax cut that mostly goes to rich people ahead of the lives of children why has it chipped and funded already if these were potato chips they were taking away from us we would be marching on Washington with pitchforks and spears right now when was the last time the Jimmy Kimmel didn't cry during a comedy monologue do we remember was that lay was like 2008 or something that every day now it seems he's constantly shoving his politics down our throat amber whatever happened to Johnny Carson or Jay Leno or entertainers forcing their politics down our throats because they're hacks or is it because we now demand politics in our entertainment I think it's a bit of both Act actually I think in many ways Donald Trump has sort of brought the politics out of people who would normally be non-political because a lot of these people say Donald Trump is just the worst thing that happened to America ever so we all have to share our political views now because we're in this unprecedented state of politics at the same time though we do have to remember that we probably wouldn't be talking about Jimmy Kimmel show if he weren't parading his son around onstage in this disgusting manner so it has been helping their views to some extent he's gotten a disgusting amount of YouTube views on all these clips of him crying about health care and it's kind of easy Hollywood friendship and political points for them to be constantly attacking Republicans and Donald Trump you're absolutely right we would not talk about Jimmy Kimmel he hasn't been funny in a while he used to be sort of funny and now he's become this political hack so he's got to up the ante turn it up to 11 and literally parade his six son all over television so that we will talk about him eriell the premise of his tirade is wrong chip is funded it will continue to be funded Republicans voted to fund it last week the Children's Health Insurance Program will be funded doesn't matter that the premise is complete nonsense does it matter to his audience or to the political discourse well it's interesting because Democrats actually are the ones are voting against we're doing the funding if I remember correctly well they're upset they're the Republicans wanted to get the funding from so in my mind not even just incorrect it's actually humanizing the wrong party so if you want to you know throw daggers throwing daggers the Democrats in this situation but regardless I think that the issue I have asserted this form of grandstanding that's been taking place and you kind of we just talked about this in Prior podcast but there's sort of a sense of notoriety and fame has now become associated with attacking Trump attacking Trump and the GOP whether I don't know how long that gravy train is going to last but that seems to be sort of the prerogative of a lot of entertainers who see their ratings falling and that can also apply to both entertainers and politicians at least as we've seen I think I was trying to fall in the camps that a lot of Jeff lakes sort of trying to reinvigorate please popularity is through condemning Trump but anyway we can talk about that another time but I do think that this is like amber said it's it's highly inappropriate but just should go to show that people appreciate or maybe they don't appreciate everything's become politicized now I would say it's not even I think it's the politics this area and I think that there are a lot of people who feel like they know everything they need to know by just watching Jimmy Kimmel or John Oliver and seemed no 140 character tweet you know understanding the process of chip and how it gets how funding gets accrued it takes a little bit more it takes a little bit more effort and I just don't see that taking place and sort of our soundbite driven social media and it doesn't fit into a 140 character it doesn't fit into 280 characters chip is a it's a federal program if federal programs require funding from certain places and the way that that legislation is made is like way that sausage is made but how many of these people who are harping on it how many people like Jimmy Kimmel could explain to you what chip is how it was how it became a federal program where the funding comes from how the funding is spent and how much money is wasted it seems to me very few of them right well I think there's an element like I said I think hysteria is what drives a lot of a political dialogue and is especially coming from the Democrats it's a politics of fear you know how many times you can hear with the tax bill that millions are going to die how many do we hear when you know Republicans were advocating for repealing the individual mandate for Obamacare how many times have you hear the Concord say millions are going to die I mean this is their cross Achra spawns to nearly every policy decision what makes Jimmy Kimmel indifferent is that he's he's advocating for or he's presenting a position that didn't exist on the GOP side so he's still saying that GOP decisions basically no matter what the GOP does millions are going to die that's pretty much become the narrative of the left no that's because Trump is literally Hitler that makes sense there's a there's a perfect parallelism makes sense to me we have to move on to my favorite story of the day this I woke up to this story I just popped right out of bed I was so happy to see it senator Elizabeth Warren chief laia Wafaa responded to a trump tweet by calling her Democrat Senate colleague Kirsten Gillibrand a slut so Donald Trump for his tweeted quote lightweight senator Kirsten Gillibrand a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office begging for campaign contributions not so long ago and would do anything for them is now in the ring fighting against Trump very disloyal to Bill and crooked used I didn't say crooked Hillary anymore just crooked they were billing crooked and so senator Warren decided to respond by by calling her colleague a slut so she responded quote are you really trying to bully intimidate and slut-shame senator Gillibrand do you know who you're picking a fight with good luck with that Donald Trump nevertheless she persisted it's on that response is unbelievable but Arielle first is it fair to say the premise of Senator lieth of Foca Hondas his tweet is that Donald Trump called Kirsten Gillibrand a slut did he do that he did it anything to get campaign donations now you perfect that as a sexual no no that's on you I think Donald Trump has done after many different people for a long the sentencing lines who say that they're eager and they're begging for donations so that's not unusual for Donald Trump I think that again this urn appeals to the mass hysteria what's more disturbing to me is that you know Elizabeth Warren and suggesting her colleague is a slut and that Trump is shaming her for it dary how dare anyone slit a shame you for being a slut I don't think it was the Warren knows what slut-shaming means I would I was surprised that's the word she chose to use sort of capture Donald Trump's criticism but Amer I probably have you probably been following this warrants better than I have in Kris their responses well it's amazing the reaction because a Donald Trump knows what he's doing he knows what he's especially with these tweets he is the true he is the poet of tweeting he is the William Shakespeare of tweeting so he knows when he says something she would do anything he knows how the left is going to respond now obviously saying that you will prioritize that a Democrat or a politician will prioritize donors over the American people and constituents that's the oldest political attack there is Donald Trump rode that line of attack all the way to the White House he said I can't be bought by everybody everybody else has bought and paid for by donors but he knew that they would respond that way and they can't resist from doing it they have to put their heads right in the gutter and then he can stand there and say what's the matter with you I'm saying a typical timeless political insult and you're bringing it right to sex you dirty mainstream media perverts now amber Liz Warren alleged that he called Gillibrand a slut but she didn't attack him for calling her a slut she attacked him for suggesting that it's bad to be a slut has the sexual revolution advanced so much that the left can no longer take offense at being called a slut when you you simply have to accept that premise and then say that that's not a bad thing well yeah it's it's so strange the way that she chose to attack the Trump suite a normal person if he if they really thought that Trump was making some kind of sexual innuendo I would imagine they would throw up their hands and they would say how dare you accuse my colleague of you know wanting to use sexual failures to get campaign contributions she would never do that that's disgusting it's unethical instead Elizabeth Warren's response was that even if senator Gillibrand had done that then shame on you for criticizing her it's not that she would have that she would never do that it's that even if she did you're wrong for calling her a slut for doing it it's so absurd I mean if that really is the case that she did that and I don't even think that's what Trump was implying because he's used the same language about senator Ted Cruz for example he said to MIT Romney said MIT Romney came begging for my endorsement I could have told him to get on his knees was he sexually harassing Romney apparently so it's it's so funny that you know even if that's what Trump was implying for them to take issue with the fact that he was calling her a slut rather than that he was accusing her of doing something unethical is just indicative of how politically correct the left is and Elizabeth Warren's clearly trying to play into the young millennial SlutWalk modern feminism ploy where women are allowed to do whatever they want and they can't be criticized for it because you're just such shaming or being sexist so I think this is just another example of her trying to get ready for 2020 trying to get those young people in her base an area well shame is very much under attack right now people don't like shame probably because our culture is is decadent and I'm not complaining decadent cultures are a lot of fun but the shame is getting short shrift here isn't there place for shame in society in self-discipline in the way that you live your own life isn't shame doesn't it serve an edifying role at times it shame is sort of how we depend on eternal shame in both external shame to regulate our own and that's something human like for here all psychologists tell you whether it be in a business setting like a professional setting or whether it be an online personal you know person-to-person basis shame is what prevents us from learning those around us and from making decisions that are best for our own interests and so when it comes to you know with kind of what amber was alluding to this you'll see we're gonna see a lot more of this sort of permitting you know behavior are preventing anyone from engaging in self-evaluation especially from the left because you have a lot of figures who tend to be on the older end of the spectrum on the left side of the party and they're really trying to appeal to those young leftist voters and this is a way for them to sort of show their progressive chops we're not going to be judgmental like the establishment Democrats you know we're gonna be we're gonna be free loving and more free spirited and you do you and there's no real element young man mm-hm there's a right hypocrisy to it too because these are the same people who are using public shame to rid politics in the media of all of these sexual harassers it's the same exact tactic yet they don't want to apply it inward well this is the irony of cultural relativism is at the the same people who are saying that no culture is better than any other culture and all cultures are the same and how dare you assert cultural superiority are the same ones who are claiming that there's a rape culture on college campuses if no culture has been better than any other why should we worry about a rape culture they can't answer that because obviously we all know that certain cultures are better than others and and we wouldn't choose a rape culture if if that were a reality but it really it horses they're mellow and it makes them get all judgy you know you know what I mean man all right we have to move on I need to get a little judgmental on the fake news media because we have another fake news roundup today we did a whole episode on News but then one of my favorite fiction novelists Chris Chris Alisa and with the Will Ferrell impersonator Jim Acosta have really given us a great performance today here is Sarah Huckabee Sanders smacking around Jim Acosta star of anchorman I would just say sir that the journalists make honest mistakes sometimes a lot of times you don't there's a very big difference between making honest mistakes and purposefully misleading the American people something that happens regularly you can't say I'm not done you cannot say that it's an honest mistake when you're purposely putting out information that you know to be false or when you're taking information that hasn't been validated that hasn't been offered any credibility and that has been continually denied by a number of people including people with direct knowledge of an instance this is something that I'm speaking about the number of reports that have taken place over the last couple of weeks I'm simply stating that there should be a certain level of responsibility in that so what Sarah Huckabee Sanders said there by the way is 100% true now you might take issue you say well we don't have evidence that they're intentionally cooking up stories but just to point out her diction there she said either if they're cooking up stories or if they're running stories recklessly without vetting their information because of that or her statement is 100% true and by the way there's plenty of evidence that they're just cooking up stories and intentionally pushing them this didn't stop CNN's Chris ELISA from running this headline today Sarah Sanders just made a hugely offensive allegation against the media now it might be offensive but it's true it's a hit the reality is offensive to the news media because they're publishing fake stories there have been three major screw-ups from the media three major retractions in just the last three days Chris ELISA I love that he's the guy to run this story today because he also he ran another story before the election which was titled quote Donald Trump's chances of winning are approaching zero approaching zero that was Chris ELISA who says how dare you say that we get stories wrong or we recklessly run stories without the corroborating evidence now amber the mainstream media have been exposed as hacks and liars and lying hacks is there any way for them to recover their credibility from here oh man it's gonna be really really hard because they just keep digging the hole even deeper no they don't CN n of course had that faust report on Friday about Don junior and WikiLeaks where they got the date of an email wrong the only thing about that report by the way the only thing that was wrong about that report was every single thing that they said about it but other than that the story was pretty accurate I think yeah and they talked to two different sources supposedly independently who gave both gave them the wrong date I mean it's incredibly hard to believe I'm pretty sure what happened here is that the reporters at CNN basically had their own biases about alleged collusion between Trump and Russia confirmed so they ended up running with the story even though they didn't even see a physical copy of the email or have independent verification of size by the way do you know what I think about that story I think this is my conspiracy hat on so I'll put on the tinfoil hat but having worked on some campaigns before I would not be surprised at all if it was a Republican who leaked that info to CNN knowing that CNN wouldn't vet the information knowing that they would recklessly run with it because it confirmed their biases we know that the Trump administration did this to Rachel Maddow over those tax returns I wouldn't be surprised and if so excellent job because you totally exposed CNN for doing it it's just hard for me to believe that Democrats could be that incompetent to leak information with with a completely wrong date on it but if it was a dirty trick well done a wonderful political trick to expose those hacks at CNN arielle some of the degradation of journalism has been driven by demand so we want more opinion in our reporting we don't just want the facts facts are boring the clicks go to saucy headlines and opinion journalism that guy Dave Wiegel who hosted that completely fake story about Trump's crowd size he was hired to provide facts and opinion and analysis and whatever they know that they drive this is is the way forward more opinion or should the news media be sacrificing some views to get less biased coverage or more balanced coverage like firm in the sense that you know there are if you really have a strong opinion and you don't think you are capable of producing a report on an event without that opinion impacting your report then you should be an opinion journalist you should write for a a political journal that has a particular given slant there are people that have plants and they know this about themselves and so as a result of that they you know they join they become political journalists with a particular slant and they join that given publication my issue is that there are plenty of wonderful journalists out there who work extra extra hard in fact I know them and I'm close friends with them that work extra extra hard to make sure their opinion doesn't infiltrate their work however those people end up being in the minority what I've seen from mainstream outlets is that we have too many journalists we're taking for granted now they see themselves as sort of what I understand is moral arbiters they see themselves as firefighters you see themselves as part of the resistance and so everything they do in pursuit a resisting Trump is somehow morally good and so in that sense they don't they put their resistance to trump and their resistance of the GOP agenda as the number-one priority as opposed to reporting absolute fact what Sarah Huckabee Sanders said it was not necessarily incorrect because the line between reckless reporting and intentional misinformation is there but it's very slim and it's also often blurred right if you're driving at extremely high speeds and an accident occurs you are you no longer responsible same goes for plagiarism um amber can probably speak because she works directly in the industry there are harsh penalties for plagiarism and you know that and sometimes it's not even intentional but the punishment is still the same because and that sort of goes when I think about how we punish or how we respond to misinformation yes they're genuine mistakes but the result of misinformation whether it's intentional are just a matter of carelessness the result is still the same you still scribed false information and I know the way to punish it I know my favorite way to punish it which is to just keep ridiculing them show them we showed this clip yesterday from CNN where it looks like journalism and for so long we thought it was journalism we thought it was news the guys wearing that nice tie and his hair is combed and they're speaking seriously they're probably wearing these glasses you know and it seems like a serious conversation but it's not news it's just fabricated nonsense and partisan hackery and I'm more than happy to keep ridiculing it bring it on baby it is extra cuff fa at this time of year ladies thank you for being here amber Athey from The
