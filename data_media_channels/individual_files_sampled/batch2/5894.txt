well it is fifth amendment night in America on this historic day when President Donald J Trump's attorney took the fifth amendment in federal court and we know what Donald Trump thinks of the fifth amendment you see the mob takes if it if you're innocent why you taking the Fifth Amendment oh this is so unfair to Michael Cohen he doesn't look like a mob guy he doesn't look like an attorney for the mob okay he hangs around with guys who maybe hug too much and smoke too many cigars but Michael Cohen himself didn't smoke a single cigar didn't even touch a cigar those pictures were Michael Cohen back on cigar day in America when he was trying to make a public display of how confident he was that he had nothing to worry about while proceedings were underway in a federal courtroom in Manhattan to clarify how evidence would be handled the evidence obtained in FBI raids on Michael Cohen's home his offices hotel room but Michael Cohen is not pretending not to be worried anymore because Michael Cohen was forced to take the Fifth Amendment today forced not by special prosecutor Robert Muller forced not by federal prosecutors in Manhattan who are sorting through the evidence gathered in the raid Michael Cohen was forced to take the Fifth Amendment today by our first guest tonight Michael avenatti the attorney for storming Daniels in her lawsuit against Donald J Trump also known as David Dennison and Michael Cohen Michael avenatti has once again legally cornered Donald Trump and Michael Cohen and forced Michael Cohen to make a dramatic admission tonight the first big admission Michael avenatti legally forced out of Donald Trump is that Donald Trump is indeed David Dennison the President of the United States actually used the alias David Dennison when President trumps California lawyer first went into federal court in Los Angeles to move the stormy Daniels case out of state court that was the very first time that the president officially admitted in a court filing that he is David Dennison the name that appears in the confidentiality agreement with storming Daniels that was a huge thing for the President of the United States to formally admit that he used an alias in a confidentiality agreement with an actress and director who calls herself a porn star and he was forced to admit that because of the legal steps taken by Michael avenatti on behalf of stormy Daniels and then because Michael avenatti continued to press his case in court and in the court of public opinion Michael avenatti forced Donald Trump to answer this question and exactly two business days later the FBI decided to ask Michael Cohen that question by raiding his home raiding his office and raiding his hotel room to look for the answer to that question and many other questions about Michael Cohen and Donald Trump and now that the raid has taken place apparently sparked by the stormy Daniels lawsuit Michael avenatti has forced the man who still signs his emails Michael D Cohen esquire personal attorney to President Donald J Trump to admit that he Michael Cohen might be involved in a crime or crimes in a filing in federal court in Los Angeles today Michael Cohen asked for a delay in the stormy Daniels lawsuit because he says he cannot answer any questions under oath about storming Daniel's Michael Cohen declared in writing to the court today based upon the advice of counsel I will assert my Fifth Amendment rights in connection with all proceedings in this case due to the ongoing criminal investigation by the FBI and the US attorney for the Southern District of New York now you cannot use the Fifth Amendment to simply refuse to answer questions because you don't want to answer those questions or because you think the answers would be embarrassing to you a 1906 Supreme Court ruling clarified that a witness can invoke the Fifth Amendment quote only where a witness is asked to incriminate himself you only have the legal right to use the Fifth Amendment if the answer that you would give to a question might incriminate you according to an article in criminal justice and American Bar Association publication the standard phrasing for a witness invoking the Fifth Amendment is quote I refuse to answer on the ground that my answer may tend to incriminate me so Michael Cohen cannot answer questions about storming Daniels and storming Daniel's relationship to Donald Trump and why Donald Trump is also known as David Dennis and Michael Cohen can't answer questions about where he got the hundred and thirty thousand dollars to paste or McDaniels Michael Cohen can't answer questions about why he did all of that because Michael Cohen said his answers to any questions about anything having to do with stormy Daniels could implicate him in a crime what crime for what crime or crimes does Michael Cohen fear incriminating himself and does he also fear incriminating Donald Trump hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching
