that video the one you just watched was taken at 2:00 a.m. on Sunday morning in the middle of the night the airport of McAllen Texas City where I've been the past two days and the home of the nation's largest immigration processing center what you see in that video it's a video you'll only see her here on all in the small group of detained migrant teenagers mean many and matching outfits being marched single-file out of the airport after getting off a flight at 2:00 in the morning then put into a van by their handlers destination unknown we have this video thanks to my next guest who quietly spoke to one of those kids on the flight he told them she'd been detained and had no idea where she was being taken joining me the man who took the video spoke to those kids journalist Tim Wilkins with the activist group people's action tell me about the context in which you saw these kids yeah I was on a flight American Airlines flight from Dallas to McAllen it was delayed so left after midnight and there was this group of very clean-cut very polite young people who I noticed in the airport only when I got on the flight did I realize when I saw their their wristbands and their matching clothes that there was something going on here there were a total of six spread out through the plane was two chaperones in the front and two in the back I want to play a little bit of your interview with with the this teenage girl we can take a listen so that obviously wasn't the the girl that you were interviewing that was actually the person who was with the kids wouldn't give any information that's correct after while I was on the flight I managed to speak discreetly with a young lady who was sitting in the row in front of me who was had been detained three days earlier she was from Guatemala and had been swept up with the others and we're told we're taking you not told where or why looks let's listen to that right now she was talking to her to her on the plane sitting behind her yeah I was sitting right behind her and and discreetly introduced myself no she says she came alone and I just want to be clear her because there's been sort of mixing like children taken away from their parents and unaccompanied minors which is something that existed before the Trump administration under the Obama administration she said she came alone so for all we know these were people that that were not taken from their parents right based on the age of this first group that I observed they were all young teens 14 15 16 my guess is that they arrived in this country alone now when I left McAllen the next morning Monday morning lo and behold there was another group of miners hitting the airport and that group included two toddlers a boy and a girl clearly not older than six years old one of the things I think that people are discovering is both that children being separate from their parents that being casted for wins like those toddlers if indeed they were they were taken from their parents but also there's this sort of like crazy system that existed kind of under people's noses for years stretching back the Obama administration of dispersing these unaccompanied minors across the country absolutely you know there are some here in the New York area who are being resettled as we speak yeah it's interesting too that the airlines have have now started to sort of raise a hue and cry about this we had some information from one flight attendant who said she was lied to by ice who said that it was a soccer team you can see in the in the video you took they they look like they're sort of in uniform and American Airlines has now said we have no knowledge the federal government has used American to transport children who have been separated from their parents due to the recent immigration policy but we would be extremely disappointed to learn that there's a case we've therefore requested the federal government to immediately refrain from using American for the purpose transporting children who have been separated from their families due to the current immigration policy well as of this moment they can consider themselves informed that detained children have been traveling on their flights I was on the flight I spoke to the young lady who confirmed that fact so I certainly hope they'll follow through in that problem do you know if anyone else associate with the airline knew I witnessed an interaction in the Dallas Airport where the two handlers the burly man who you see in the video had an exchange with the ticketing agents it clearly to get seat assignments or whatever I thought it was curious but I didn't even know that they were traveling as a group until I saw them reunited in the McAllen Airport and realized that they were the handlers so clearly either American as a you know a standing arrangement with eyes or with DHS but clearly there's some arrangement in place yeah it seems unlikely that an airline and this is the sort of thing you would imagine has been sort of contracted in bulk rather than just a sort of one-off purchasing of tickets correct well you know we know that they have these agreements but you know they would have had to identify these passengers in some way and and they all had their their prism bracelets with their names on them right Tim Wilkins thanks so much for being with thank you hey there
