WHAT HAPPENED TO CALIFORNIA'S
ECONOMY OVER THE PAST DECADE
WITH JERRY BROWN.
>> THANK YOU, STEVE, THE
CALIFORNIA DREAM INCLUDING A 3 3
BEDROOM HOUSE USED TO BE
OBTAINABLE.
TODAY THE DREAM IS FAR TOO
EXPENSIVE.
CALIFORNIA IS THE FIFTH LARGEST
ECONOMY.
IT'S THE HIGHEST IN INCOME TAX,
SALES TAX, AND GAS TAX WHICH IS
50-CENT PER GALLON.
THE STATE IS GEARING UP FOR
PENSION CRISIS.
THEY HAVE A LIABILITY FOR WHAT
THEY HAVE IN ASSETS.
THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM IS THE
NATIONS LARGEST PENSION TRUST
FUND.
IN 2016 THIS WAS ONLY 69%
FUNDED.
THAT'S A $168 BILLION LIABILITY.
MAKING UP THE DIFFERENCE MEANS
MORE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM POLICE,
FIRE, AND SCHOOL DISTRICT.
GOVERNOR BROWN PASSED A MODERATE
VERSION OF PENSION REFORM IN
2012 HE COULD HAVE DONE MORE.
HE TOLD CALIFORNIA CITIES HE
WOULDN'T BAIL THEM OUT WITH
REGARD TO PENSION COSTS.
MANY SAY HIS SPENDING RECORD
LOOKS MORE PROGRESSIVE LIKE
EXPANDING MEDICAL.
OVER THE LAST DECADE MAJOR
COMPANIES ANNOUNCED PLANS TO
LEAVE THE STATE WITH LOWER
CORPORATE TAXES.
TOYOTA, CARL'S JR., AND MORE ARE
LEAVING.
MOST ARE HEADED TO TEXAS,
ADVISORY, NEVADA, OR OREGON
WHERE TAXES AND HOME PRICES ARE
A LOT LOWER.
>> THANK YOU.
STEVE: A LOT OF PEOPLE BLAME YOU
FOR THIS PENSION PROBLEM.
YOU SAID IT WAS 400 YOU SIGNED
IN 1999 THAT HANDED OUT THESE
NICE PENSION ARRANGEMENTS.
DO YOU FEEL RESPONSIBILITY FOR
THIS FISCAL CRISIS THAT'S
HITTING CALIFORNIA.
>> IF I HAD TO DO IT OVER AGAIN
I WOULDN'T DO IT.
I WANT TO POINT THIS OUT.
IN 2007 THEY WERE 110% OVER
FUNDED.
THE PROBLEM DIDN'T OCCUR UNTIL
THE GREAT RECESSION.
THAT INVOLVED A LOT OF FRAUD.
PEOPLE GETTING LOANS WITHOUT
SIGNING DOCUMENTS.
IT'S NOT JUST A RECESSION BUT
FRAUD PLUS A RECESSION.
THAT HIT THE PENSION FUNDS
BADLY.
YOU WILL SEE PROGRESS.
NOT FROM THE GOVERNORS REFORMS,
THEY ARE A GOOD START.
THE COURTS WILL STEP-IN.
TWO APPELLATE COURTS SAID
CALIFORNIA CAN ADJUST A PENSION
FOR A PORTION OF SOMEONES
EMPLOYMENT THAT HASN'T BEEN
FILLED.
YOU CAN ADJUST THE PENSION AS
LONG AS IT'S REASONABLE.
THAT'S GOING TO THE SUPREME
COURT.
STEVE: THE IDEA THAT CALIFORNIA
IS A MODEL FOR THE REST OF THE
COUNTRY --
>> IT'S A MODEL IN THIS REGARD.
STEVE: WE'LL GET TO THAT IN THE
NEXT PART OF THE DEBATE.
YOU ARE LIVING HERE NOW.
WHAT'S EXTRAORDINARY TO ME.
I'M SURE THE CONGRESSMAN WILL
CHALLENGE ME.
I'LL PUT-OUT THE DATA WE HAVE.
YOU HAVE PEOPLE LEAVING THE
STATE.
YET, SERVICES ARE BEING CUT IN
MANY AREAS.
IT FEELS LIKE THIS IS REALLY
IMCOMPETENT.
>> HOW DO YOU HAVE THE FIFTH
LARGEST ECONOMY AND STRUGGLE
LIKE THIS.
HOW ARE SERVICES GOING DOWN AND
PRICES GOING UP.
HOW DO WE HAVE HIGH INCOME TAXES
AND HOMELESSNESS.
HOW IS A STATE IN THIS PLACE.
THIS IS A GREAT PLACE TO BE BUT
IT'S BEEN DESTROYED FAR TOO
LONG.
I'M NOT SURE HOW MOVING TEXAS TO
CALIFORNIA WE COULD BE IN SUCH
BAD SHAPE.
THE ANSWER IS SITTING ACROSS
FATHER OR
FRTHER OR
FROMER OR
FROM U OR
FROM US.R
STEVE: WOULD YOU SAY CALIFORNIA
IS A GOOD MODEL.
>> WE ARE TOP IN HEALTH AND LIFE
EXPECTANCY.
WE ARE TOP IN ENTREPRENEUR.
WE ARE TOP IN SINCE.
>> WHY IS EVERYONE LEAVING?
>> WE ARE GROWING.
>> THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE
GROWING.
>> WE HAVE MORE ILLEGAL
IMMIGRANTS AND AMERICAN BORN
CITIZENS THAN ANY OTHER STATE BY
FAR.
THEY CAN LEAVE IN ANY OTHER
STATE AND THEY CHOSE LIKE YOU
CHOSE THIS ONE.
WE HAVE THE BEST SCIENCE.
WE HAVE THE LARGEST BUDGET
SURPLUS.
TEXAS HAS A $9 BILLION DEFICIT.
AS FAR AS THE LIABILITIES OTHER
STATES HAVE MUCH LARGER
PERCENTAGE.
STEVE: IF THE BUDGET IS SUCH
GOOD SHAPE WHY ARE THERE
SPENDING CUTS HITTING SCHOOLS
AND PARKS AND RECREATIONS.
WORKERS YOU SEE SPENDING CUTS.
>> NOT IN HIGHER EDUCATION.
STEVE: THE UNIVERSITY OF
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN CUT.
>> THE KEY TO SILICON VALLEY IS
THE GREATEST PUBLIC UNIVERSITY
SYSTEM IN THE WORLD.
TEN CAMPUSES --
>> CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE REST OF
THE STATE.
>> THERE ARE OTHER CITIES
FALLING APART.
SAN FRANCISCO IS RUINED.
LAS ANGELES HAS 10,000 PEOPLE
LIVING ON THE STREET.
STEVE: WE'LL GET TO THAT.
>> IT'S INTERESTING THAT JERRY
BROWN --
>> THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOOD AT ONE
THING AND WE HAVE TO PAY FOR IT.
THEIR POLICIES LIKE AB 109 AND
EARLY RELEASE.
PROP 47 AND 57.
WE HAVE A CHOSE TO BRING
LEADERSHIP IN THE STATE AND
BRING IT TO THE GOLDEN STATE.
>> DO YOU WANT TO LIVE WITH THE
CRIME RATE WE HAD UNDER
IT'S MUCH BETTER.
STEVE: I'M GLAD YOU MENTIONED
THAT.
>> IT'S MUCH LOWER.
IT HIT AN ALL-TIME LOW IN 2014.
IT'S INCHED --
STEVE: DO YOU TALK TO PEOPLE WHO
LIVE HERE --
>> YOU WERE HERE IN 1990.
YOU WEREN'T HERE IN 1980 OR
1970.
WE HAD MUCH HIGHER --
STEVE: I AM NOW.
>> IT'S MUCH HIGHER UNDER
REPUBLICANS.
STEVE: WHAT THEY SEE IS AN
EXPLOSION IN CRIME, THEFTS,
ROBBERIES BECAUSE OF THE BILL
AND PROPOSITION GOVERNOR BROWN
PUSHED THROUGH THAT MADE IT FREE
OF ANY CRIMINAL PENALTY FOR ANY
THEFT UNDER $950.
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE.
>> LET ME HOLDUP THE CHART.
>> THEY ARE GOOD AT LYING.
>> VIOLENT CRIME, HERE ARE THE
STATISTICS DROPPED WHEN GOVERNOR
DAVIS TOOK OVER.
>> RIGHT.
>> I'M SURE EVERYBODY HERE THAT
KNOWS SOMEONE THAT'S THE VICTIM
OF A CRIME.
>> THEY WOULD LIKE MORE PRISONS
OUT.
STEVE: IT'S PEOPLE ACCOUNTS OF
THEIR DAILY LIFE.
>> YOU WEREN'T HERE FOR THE
DAILY LIFE OF PEOPLE.
STEVE: I'M TALKING ABOUT NOW.
>> LET ME JUMP IN.
WE HAVE MORE --
>> DOES THE AVERAGE AMERICAN
CARE ABOUT THAT?
>> HAVE YOU HEARD OF FACEBOOK,
APPLE ALL OF THEM ARE LOCATED IN
CALIFORNIA.
>> WHEN YOU DESTROY THE
MIDDLE-CLASS AND RUN THEM OUT IT
DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY GREAT
UNIVERSITIES YOU HAVE.
STEVE: WHY IS IT, THOUGH, MORE
PEOPLE ARE LEAVING.
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE.
>> YOU LOST 1 MILLION WORKERS
AND BUSINESS OWNERS BECAUSE OF
THESE GUYS.
WE CAN'T ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN.
WE WANT PEOPLE TO COME HERE AND
BE SAFE.
STEVE: WE ARE OUT OF TIME.
>> LOOK AT THE CENSUS.
