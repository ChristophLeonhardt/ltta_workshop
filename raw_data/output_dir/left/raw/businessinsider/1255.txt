company called body shop and there was

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,139
myself so there was no other

8
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,240
entrepreneurs that was it you know all

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,340
the companies were run by governments

10
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,500

not hundreds of thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

14
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">entrepreneurs and and each of those</font>

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,180
entrepreneurs are making you know a

16
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,559
positive difference to other people's

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,840
lives in different sectors so it's a

18
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,719
tremendously exciting time for people to

19
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,239
be alive and you know at a time here in

20
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,600
America where people are worried<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

21
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,800
the government that's going to govern

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,590
them I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think fortunately entrepreneurs</font>

23
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,270
can do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know the</font>

24
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,489
compensating work I mean if the

25
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:54,780
government decide that climate change

26
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,590
doesn't exist which is extremely bizarre

27
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,180
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> there was really the case then we as</font>

28
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,619
entrepreneurs just got to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there</font>

29
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:08,189
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and fill the gap and and create</font>

30
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:09,930
hundreds of thousands of jobs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and make</font>

31
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,700
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we do get to a</font>

32
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,030
carbon-neutral world by 2050 and so I

33
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,180
think you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if when government is</font>

34
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,330
lacking then entrepreneurs<font color="#E5E5E5"> eaters step</font>

35
00:01:21,330 --> 00:00:00,000
into the breach
