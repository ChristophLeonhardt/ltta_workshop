1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
- 2016 review, 2016 in review.

2
00:00:06,914 --> 00:00:09,500
Yeah, take one. (claps)

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,667
So, 2016, praise God from
whom all blessings flow,

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,447
has ended, (laughs) and
what a year, you know?

5
00:00:21,832 --> 00:00:23,499
What a, what a year.

6
00:00:25,437 --> 00:00:29,401
I have a grateful jar
that I write little notes

7
00:00:29,401 --> 00:00:31,639
to myself every time
something has happened

8
00:00:31,639 --> 00:00:34,796
that I am grateful for,
and I will be reviewing

9
00:00:34,796 --> 00:00:37,402
that grateful jar in this video, but also

10
00:00:37,402 --> 00:00:39,387
I want to go ahead and review back,

11
00:00:39,387 --> 00:00:42,127
at the beginning of the year
I made some proclamations

12
00:00:42,127 --> 00:00:44,932
into the ether for the
year 2016 that I wanted

13
00:00:44,932 --> 00:00:48,261
to have happen, so let's
check out some of those

14
00:00:48,261 --> 00:00:52,505
and see how or if any
of them happened at all.

15
00:00:52,505 --> 00:00:55,422
More financial stability... please.

16
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:59,385
So yeah, more financial stability,

17
00:00:59,385 --> 00:01:01,683
I mean, I achieved that I guess,

18
00:01:01,683 --> 00:01:04,334
I did get a raise this year, about midway

19
00:01:04,334 --> 00:01:06,503
through the year I got a raise, which,

20
00:01:06,503 --> 00:01:09,101
ooh, I am still trying, though,

21
00:01:09,101 --> 00:01:11,351
something that I am still trying to do

22
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:13,854
is figure out a way to
have passive income.

23
00:01:13,854 --> 00:01:16,418
Something very specific
that I said in that video

24
00:01:16,418 --> 00:01:20,978
was that I wanted to sort
of diversify my income

25
00:01:20,978 --> 00:01:25,259
to where only 50% of my income
came from what I do full time

26
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,159
with Big Picture Lab, the
specific company I work for.

27
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,358
Just don't like having all
the eggs in one basket,

28
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:32,708
you know what I'm saying?

29
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:34,310
I'm trying to diversify that.

30
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,658
I would love to do more voiceover work,

31
00:01:36,658 --> 00:01:38,353
but like a character.

32
00:01:38,353 --> 00:01:39,370
Ha!

33
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,370
So I did dabble in this,

34
00:01:43,322 --> 00:01:46,521
I believe I vlogged
about it at some point,

35
00:01:46,521 --> 00:01:49,748
I'll link to that in the Eye of Sauron.

36
00:01:49,748 --> 00:01:53,394
And I have gotten a few things,
just little one-off things,

37
00:01:53,394 --> 00:01:56,071
little quick things, mostly
for production friends,

38
00:01:56,071 --> 00:01:58,170
people that are already
in production and know

39
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,246
that I have a decent
voice, and so they'll just

40
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:01,747
call me over, like, can you do

41
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,335
this thing for me right quick?

42
00:02:03,335 --> 00:02:05,028
I'm like yeah sure, no problem.

43
00:02:05,028 --> 00:02:06,527
Because I have all the equipment.

44
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:09,090
I did that, but I guess
becoming professional

45
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,673
in voiceover work, not so much,

46
00:02:12,529 --> 00:02:15,007
mostly, not because I can't do it,

47
00:02:15,007 --> 00:02:19,047
but just because to start off,
the market is very saturated,

48
00:02:19,047 --> 00:02:22,994
and so to get into it you kind
of need to drop everything

49
00:02:22,994 --> 00:02:26,437
and do it full time and be
constantly auditioning online,

50
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,838
and I don't have the time to do it.

51
00:02:28,838 --> 00:02:31,607
So once again, tying into the first thing,

52
00:02:31,607 --> 00:02:34,709
it isn't a way for me
to make passive income.

53
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:37,580
Again, it's fun and I enjoy doing it,

54
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,628
and when people need stuff,
all you gotta do is message me

55
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:42,705
and I'll totally do it for
you and we can figure out

56
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:45,765
a rate or whatever, but
doing it on that level

57
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:50,311
for some of these bigger voice
agencies that are out there,

58
00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:52,513
eh, not my bag, baby.

59
00:02:52,513 --> 00:02:54,253
I just don't have the time.

60
00:02:54,253 --> 00:02:56,756
As you all know I am
married to Mister Hallease,

61
00:02:56,756 --> 00:02:59,326
he is an amazing man, I love him dearly.

62
00:02:59,326 --> 00:03:02,928
He is finishing up his
masters degree this May,

63
00:03:02,928 --> 00:03:06,229
and so with that, I would
love for Mister Hallease

64
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:09,940
to find enjoyment and
pleasure in his work.

65
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,523
Yay, so Mister Hallease
did graduate in May

66
00:03:14,918 --> 00:03:17,670
with his master's degree,
super proud of him.

67
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,125
And yeah, he graduated
with his master's degree

68
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:24,317
in nursing administration
and he now works here

69
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:28,292
in San Antonio, which is why I
now no longer live in Austin,

70
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:31,624
I now live here in San Antonio, Texas.

71
00:03:31,624 --> 00:03:34,875
And he enjoys it a lot,
it's been a real blessing

72
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:38,542
to see him be able to
move away from the ER,

73
00:03:39,476 --> 00:03:43,788
which is high stress,
and didn't get weekends

74
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:46,703
and things like that, to moving here,

75
00:03:46,703 --> 00:03:48,400
and basically more or less going into

76
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,033
a nine to five situation,
Monday through Friday.

77
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:53,965
And also, the catalyst of
moving back here to San Antonio

78
00:03:53,965 --> 00:03:57,150
has been awesome because
my family does live here,

79
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,959
and we are a lot closer to his family too,

80
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:03,183
it's not as far of a drive
to travel to see them.

81
00:04:03,183 --> 00:04:05,882
So it's been a blessing in disguise

82
00:04:05,882 --> 00:04:09,224
to be this close to family, my
sister is actually pregnant,

83
00:04:09,224 --> 00:04:12,241
she's gonna have her child in March,

84
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:15,491
so it all, it all just seemed to align.

85
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:20,695
The day Mister Hallease told
me that he'd got this job

86
00:04:20,695 --> 00:04:23,317
here in San Antonio, my sister messaged me

87
00:04:23,317 --> 00:04:25,134
that same day letting me
know she was pregnant.

88
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:27,541
So it's like, sometimes, as they say,

89
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,675
you need to ride the wave,

90
00:04:29,675 --> 00:04:33,533
it seems like God is pushing
you in a certain direction

91
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:36,152
and you need to just go with it.

92
00:04:36,152 --> 00:04:38,021
So that's been cool.

93
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:41,174
All right, so let's get
into this grateful jar

94
00:04:41,174 --> 00:04:44,529
stuffsy-stuffs, got 'em right here.

95
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:46,946
So January 2016, sans gluten,

96
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:52,061
right, so there we go,
let's talk about that.

97
00:04:53,017 --> 00:04:55,409
Failed, that was a failed thing.

98
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:57,956
I started Sans Gluten as
its own separate channel

99
00:04:57,956 --> 00:05:00,840
and then realized, I'm doing the most,

100
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,656
I'm doing a little too much,

101
00:05:02,656 --> 00:05:05,036
collapsed it back into this channel.

102
00:05:05,036 --> 00:05:07,362
It's not in here, but it should be,

103
00:05:07,362 --> 00:05:10,974
in April I fricken did
VEDA, okay, and that was

104
00:05:10,974 --> 00:05:13,918
the first time I've done
VEDA and it was successful.

105
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:16,078
I think a lot of y'all
actually know me now

106
00:05:16,078 --> 00:05:20,881
because of VEDA, so booya,
I did a VEDA, bloop bloop.

107
00:05:20,881 --> 00:05:25,048
June 5th, let's see, I started
the accountability group,

108
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:30,043
which is awesome, I love
meeting with them every month.

109
00:05:30,043 --> 00:05:34,815
It really does lift my spirits
so much meeting with them.

110
00:05:34,815 --> 00:05:37,065
June 28th through July 4th,

111
00:05:38,353 --> 00:05:41,497
vacation, wedding in Telluride.

112
00:05:41,497 --> 00:05:44,083
My friend who is also in
the accountability group

113
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,874
got married in Telluride, Colorado,

114
00:05:46,874 --> 00:05:49,314
and I believe I made a
travel video about that.

115
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:50,997
And that was really cool,
it was a really cool

116
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:52,852
experience to see that
part of the country,

117
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,331
I've never been to Colorado, well I have,

118
00:05:54,331 --> 00:05:56,168
when I was like eight, don't count.

119
00:05:56,168 --> 00:05:58,042
It was really cool to check out,

120
00:05:58,042 --> 00:06:01,272
I mean just a beautiful
part of our county.

121
00:06:01,272 --> 00:06:03,189
July 23rd, South Padre.

122
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:08,849
We went to South Padre with my in-laws

123
00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:13,433
on a little mini vacation and
that was a really good time.

124
00:06:13,433 --> 00:06:16,184
I enjoyed that trip a lot.

125
00:06:16,184 --> 00:06:17,017
July 29th,

126
00:06:20,786 --> 00:06:22,965
(laughs)

127
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,382
oh yeah, that's really sweet.

128
00:06:26,368 --> 00:06:30,358
On July 29th, Mister Hallease,
after he had been working

129
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:33,309
at his new job for a
week, casually said to me,

130
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:36,098
is this what happiness feels like?

131
00:06:36,098 --> 00:06:38,075
He had been really stressed, you guys,

132
00:06:38,075 --> 00:06:40,179
y'all don't even know,
the ER is stressful.

133
00:06:40,179 --> 00:06:43,507
August 20th, camping
with our friends Diego

134
00:06:43,507 --> 00:06:46,105
and Tiffany at McKinney Falls,

135
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:49,591
that was a great way to
bring in being 26 years old.

136
00:06:49,591 --> 00:06:52,020
And it rained a lot, but it was still fun.

137
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,182
I enjoyed it, grateful I went.

138
00:06:54,182 --> 00:06:55,182
August 25th,

139
00:06:56,619 --> 00:06:59,786
oh, on August 25th I received an email

140
00:07:00,749 --> 00:07:03,749
from a subscriber about her adopted son

141
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:08,707
and how much my channel was
just helping her with that.

142
00:07:08,707 --> 00:07:12,874
And that was really nice,
really fought back tears,

143
00:07:13,951 --> 00:07:16,778
fam, really fought back
tears on the email,

144
00:07:16,778 --> 00:07:18,214
let me tell y'all.

145
00:07:18,214 --> 00:07:20,131
September 2016, Boston.

146
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:25,531
Went to Boston for work and for pleasure.

147
00:07:25,531 --> 00:07:27,472
And once again, got to see a part

148
00:07:27,472 --> 00:07:30,080
of the country that I haven't seen before.

149
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,994
So that was really cool.

150
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:36,192
October 10th, Where I
Stay became a podcast.

151
00:07:36,192 --> 00:07:39,124
Is this still ongoing, am
I still working on this?

152
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:41,994
Should I been done had
like five episodes, yes

153
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:44,421
and yes and yes, but I'm out here,

154
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:46,574
I'm trying, okay, so there.

155
00:07:46,574 --> 00:07:49,157
And finally, December 4th 2016.

156
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:51,451
I ran a 10k.

157
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:56,662
So I mean, you know, was 2016 bad?

158
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:00,102
Was it?

159
00:08:00,102 --> 00:08:02,236
I think the biggest thing
for 2016 was supposed to be

160
00:08:02,236 --> 00:08:04,770
#getthesecoins, #dontgetgot, and I mean,

161
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,099
I'm working on it, 2016 felt like really

162
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:12,160
a preparatory year, it felt like a year

163
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,011
where I was beginning to
plant the seeds of things

164
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:20,844
that hopefully will be
beneficial and fruitful

165
00:08:21,787 --> 00:08:24,712
in the year to come, I feel like

166
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,712
I went through a bit of a awakening,

167
00:08:29,861 --> 00:08:32,505
I started my locks in 2016,

168
00:08:32,505 --> 00:08:36,568
I completed a VEDA in
2016, which is like, what?

169
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:39,901
And it was good, it just felt like I was

170
00:08:41,371 --> 00:08:46,223
planting a lot of seeds,
because that was all I could do.

171
00:08:46,223 --> 00:08:48,484
I wasn't at the point
yet where I could make

172
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:51,046
a big leap or anything like that,

173
00:08:51,046 --> 00:08:55,213
but I could just squirrel away
and do what I could in 2016.

174
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,600
In 2016 just overall I started adjusting

175
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,372
who I spent my time
with, I started adjusting

176
00:09:03,372 --> 00:09:07,409
how I spent my time, I found
Thomas Frank's YouTube channel.

177
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:09,984
I'm already a pretty productive person,

178
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:13,560
but that really began
to drop in the catalysts

179
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,548
of how I can be even more productive,

180
00:09:16,548 --> 00:09:18,916
how I can get more things accomplished.

181
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,607
I started my accountability
group with three

182
00:09:21,607 --> 00:09:24,661
other women in 2016 and
we more or less meet

183
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:27,004
once a month and set goals for ourselves.

184
00:09:27,004 --> 00:09:28,813
Do we be hitting them goals?

185
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:31,944
Not so much, but it's also
just a really good time

186
00:09:31,944 --> 00:09:34,254
to just fellowship with other women

187
00:09:34,254 --> 00:09:37,868
that are trying to just
be out here and do things,

188
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:41,435
and the group is diverse
enough in our interests

189
00:09:41,435 --> 00:09:44,188
and our backgrounds that
it's just really beneficial.

190
00:09:44,188 --> 00:09:48,753
So I like I said, 2016
does feel like the time

191
00:09:48,753 --> 00:09:51,836
that I used to just work on me, amen.

192
00:09:53,443 --> 00:09:56,616
Work on me, but also it
taught me a little bit

193
00:09:56,616 --> 00:09:59,884
about contentment, being
content at where I'm at

194
00:09:59,884 --> 00:10:02,200
in my life, always striving for better,

195
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,348
always striving for
more, but being content

196
00:10:04,348 --> 00:10:06,415
at where I'm at in the
journey, and realizing,

197
00:10:06,415 --> 00:10:10,165
truly embodying and
realizing it's a journey.

198
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:13,049
So yeah, that's my 2016.

199
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:18,639
In the comments below let
me know how your 2016 went.

200
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,569
Don't get me wrong, politically,
socially, what the hell.

201
00:10:22,569 --> 00:10:25,030
Personally, how was your 2016?

202
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,830
Was it good, were you feelin' it?

203
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,447
Did you do the thing?

204
00:10:29,447 --> 00:10:31,679
Did you do the thing though?

205
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,260
So let me know in the comments below,

206
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,312
and I will see you when I see you.

207
00:10:36,312 --> 00:10:38,047
Feel free to follow me on social media

208
00:10:38,047 --> 00:10:40,499
if the spirit moves you, I
try to push out new videos

209
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:42,789
every Monday at noon, but
don't quote me on that,

210
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:44,584
I'm in these streets, I'm
trying to live my life,

211
00:10:44,584 --> 00:10:46,241
I'm trying to be somebody,
above all things,

212
00:10:46,241 --> 00:10:48,671
I will see you when I see you.

213
00:10:48,671 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat jazz music)
