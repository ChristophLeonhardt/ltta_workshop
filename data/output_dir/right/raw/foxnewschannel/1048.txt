1
00:00:00,666 --> 00:00:02,135
TIME.

2
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:03,903
CONTINUED SUCCESS AT THE

3
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:04,971
SINGAPORE SUMMIT THAT WILL

4
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:05,805
BE INTERESTING ONE.

5
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:09,041
FLY ON THE WALL.

6
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:10,042
PETE: THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA

7
00:00:10,042 --> 00:00:10,943
OBSESSING, THAT'S A GOOD

8
00:00:10,943 --> 00:00:12,678
WORD FOR IT, ABOUT THE FIRST

9
00:00:12,678 --> 00:00:13,913
LADY'S WHEREABOUTS AND

10
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:16,082
TRASHING THE TRUMP WOMEN.

11
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:17,483
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

12
00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:18,284
WONDERING WHERE THE FIRST

13
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,118
LADY IS.

14
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:21,220
>> THE LAST TIME WE CAUGHT A

15
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,923
GLIMPSE OF HER WAS ON

16
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:24,424
MAY 10TH, 24 DAYS.

17
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,492
>> I'M NOT SURPRISED IT TOOK

18
00:00:26,492 --> 00:00:28,194
THAT SHAWSHANK GUY YEARS TO

19
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:28,594
TUNNEL OUT.

20
00:00:28,594 --> 00:00:30,930
>> THE TRUMP WOMEN ARE THEY

21
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,032
JUST THE MOST STOICK HUMAN

22
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:34,567
BEINGS?

23
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:37,937
ARE THEY NUMB AND DEAD

24
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:38,571
INSIDE?

25
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:39,639
GRIFF: RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY

26
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,040
IS HERE TO WEIGH IN.

27
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,041
GOOD MORNING TO YOU, RACHEL.

28
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,076
>> GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

29
00:00:44,076 --> 00:00:44,944
ABBY: YOU ARE OUTSPOKEN

30
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:45,578
ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP.

31
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,613
YOU ARE THE PERFECT PERSON.

32
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:49,348
>> I'M SOULLESS AND HELPLESS

33
00:00:49,348 --> 00:00:50,216
AND CONTROLLED BY MEN.

34
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,884
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN HILLARY

35
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:53,419
WENT, I THINK, TO INDIA AND

36
00:00:53,419 --> 00:00:55,988
SHE SAID THE REASON WHY

37
00:00:55,988 --> 00:00:57,623
REPUBLICAN WOMEN VOTED FOR

38
00:00:57,623 --> 00:00:59,258
TRUMP -- BY THE WAY A LOT OF

39
00:00:59,258 --> 00:01:00,560
DEMOCRATIC WOMEN DID, TOO,

40
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,594
IS THAT THEY ARE CONTROLLED

41
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,596
BY THEIR HUSBANDS.

42
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:04,763
THEIR SONS AND THEIR BOSSES

43
00:01:04,763 --> 00:01:06,466
TOLD THEM TO VOTE FOR TRUMP.

44
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:09,635
THIS IS THE MEDIA AND THE

45
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:10,470
DEMOCRAT, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

46
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,170
STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

47
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,672
HOW THEY LOST THAT ELECTION.

48
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:16,375
AND IT HAS TO BE THAT WOMEN

49
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:17,543
ARE CONTROLLED BY MEN THAT

50
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:18,211
THEY ARE HELPLESS.

51
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,345
IN THE CASE OF MELANIA, THAT

52
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:20,780
SHE IS SOMEHOW A HOSTAGE IN

53
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,547
THE WHITE HOUSE.

54
00:01:21,547 --> 00:01:22,615
THAT'S HOW THEY ARE

55
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:23,816
EXPLAINING IT AND, BY THE

56
00:01:23,816 --> 00:01:24,250
WAY.

57
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,785
THAT'S WHY THEY ARE GOING TO

58
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:28,020
LOSE AGAIN IN THE MID TERMS.

59
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,822
PETE: RACHEL, IN A FAIR

60
00:01:29,822 --> 00:01:30,456
WORLD, MELANIA TRUMP WOULD

61
00:01:30,456 --> 00:01:32,024
BE SPLASHED OVER EVERY

62
00:01:32,024 --> 00:01:33,860
FASHION MAGAZINE IN AMERICA.

63
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,861
INSTEAD, THE ONE MOMENT

64
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:35,862
WHERE SHE ISN'T IN THE

65
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,196
PUBLIC BECAUSE OF A SURGERY,

66
00:01:37,196 --> 00:01:39,565
WHICH MOST OF US WOULD GIVE

67
00:01:39,565 --> 00:01:41,100
DRERCHES TO, NOW THEY ARE

68
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,201
OBSESSING OVER THAT

69
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:42,568
COVERAGE.

70
00:01:42,568 --> 00:01:44,036
WHAT IS IT ABOUT THAT DOUBLE

71
00:01:44,036 --> 00:01:44,403
STANDARD?

72
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:46,072
>> WELL, IT IS WHAT IT IS.

73
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:48,407
AND REPUBLICANS, ESPECIALLY

74
00:01:48,407 --> 00:01:50,676
REPUBLICAN WOMEN AND

75
00:01:50,676 --> 00:01:52,278
REPUBLICAN OR CONSERVATIVE

76
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,312
MINORITIES HAVE ALWAYS HAD

77
00:01:53,312 --> 00:01:55,481
TO DEAL WITH THIS EXTREME

78
00:01:55,481 --> 00:01:56,582
DOUBLE STANDARD.

79
00:01:56,582 --> 00:01:57,884
IT JUST IS WHAT IT IS.

80
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,685
THEY WERE COMPLICIT.

81
00:01:59,685 --> 00:02:01,187
WE BETRAYED OUR GENDER BY

82
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:02,755
NOT DOING WHAT THEY SAY THAT

83
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:04,257
WE SHOULD DO, FOR THINKING

84
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,958
FOR OURSELVES.

85
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:06,893
IT'S IRONIC BECAUSE IN THE

86
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,027
CASE OF MELANIA, IT COULDN'T

87
00:02:09,027 --> 00:02:10,096
BE MORE UNTRUE.

88
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:11,062
FROM DAY ONE, THIS IS A

89
00:02:11,062 --> 00:02:12,665
WOMAN WHO HAS DONE IT HER

90
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:13,132
WAY.

91
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:13,766
REMEMBER ALL THE PRESSURE

92
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,134
SHE HAD TO MOVE TO THE WHITE

93
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:16,435
HOUSE.

94
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:17,537
INAUGURATION AND SHE WAS

95
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:18,905
LIKE, YOU KNOW, THAT DOESN'T

96
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:19,605
WORK FOR ME.

97
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:21,007
I WOULD LIKE TO STAY HERE

98
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,142
AND BE WITH MY SON UNTIL HE,

99
00:02:23,142 --> 00:02:24,277
YOU KNOW, FINISHES OUT THE

100
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:25,111
SCHOOL YEAR.

101
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,679
AND, AGAIN, WITH THE

102
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:27,446
SURGERY, YOU KNOW, SHE HAD

103
00:02:27,446 --> 00:02:28,481
TO KNOW THERE WAS GOING TO

104
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,949
BE A LOT OF SPECULATION WITH

105
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:31,250
HER NOT BEING IN THE MEDIA,

106
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,084
AND SHE DIDN'T CARE.

107
00:02:32,084 --> 00:02:36,622
SHE PUT HER OWN HEALTH

108
00:02:36,622 --> 00:02:38,424
FIRST, WHICH SHE SHOULD AS A

109
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:40,192
WOMAN AND IGNORED ALL THE

110
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:42,228
NAYSAYERS AND HATERS.

111
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,229
GRIFF: QUICK PREDICTION, DO

112
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,830
YOU BELIEVE THIS WILL HELP

113
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,431
FIRST LADY MELANIA

114
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:46,732
ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS?

115
00:02:46,732 --> 00:02:47,400
BECAUSE THEY'RE ROOTING

116
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,801
AGAINST HER AND EVERYBODY

117
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,603
LOVES AN UNDERDOG.

118
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:51,437
>> ABSOLUTELY.

119
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:54,407
SHE IS GRACEFUL.

120
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:56,142
SHE IS HANDLING IT

121
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:56,542
BEAUTIFULLY.

122
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:57,677
THE WAY SHE HANDLED IT

123
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,945
GIULIANI COMMENTING ON HER

124
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,813
MARRIAGE, SHE GAVE A VERY

125
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:01,948
ELEGANT, YOU KNOW, STATEMENT

126
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:02,949
SAYING I HAVE NEVER

127
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,350
DISCUSSED ANYTHING WITH HIM.

128
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,918
THIS IS A WOMAN WHO DOES IT

129
00:03:05,918 --> 00:03:07,653
HER WAY IN A VERY ELEGANT

130
00:03:07,653 --> 00:03:09,121
WAY THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY ARE

131
00:03:09,121 --> 00:03:09,689
RESPONDING TO.

132
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,957
THEY LOVE HER STYLE.

133
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:13,826
AND I THINK SHE IS QUIETLY,

134
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:15,294
DESPITE ALL THE NAY SAYERS

135
00:03:15,294 --> 00:03:16,862
AND WINNERS WINNING OVER THE

136
00:03:16,862 --> 00:00:00,000
HEARTS OF AMERICANS.
