pigs are flying on this chilly day inhale as fred barnes reports in The Wall Street Journal that the Democrat Party may be moving slightly to the right on abortion we'll analyze then Jacob Airy and His Eminence Paul Bois are on an all-male panel of deplorable 'he's just to punish me and we will discuss banana peel microaggressions Charlie Hebdo is calling Harvey victims Nazis and how cops only kill black people I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Nolt show we're gonna have the mailbag today too so thank you for everybody who sent in a mailbag question we have lots of good ones to get to what I really want to talk about today is this vote yesterday at the LA City Council to rename Columbus Day as indigenous peoples day it was used by it so it few things offend me more than renaming Columbus Day it is anti historical it is morally idiotic it is empty virtue signaling it really drives me crazy it's ungrateful but I want to dedicate an entire episode to defending Christopher so we'll do that closer to grew at Columbus Day and today we have to talk about this great abortion story pigs are clearly flying in hell so this is a welcome change and a pretty unexpected one after the 2016 DNC platform position on this issue I'll tell you I thought even at the time even at the time I thought that was an extreme position and it moved pretty far after just in 2008 Hillary Clinton had a very different view on on abortion we can support a woman's right to choose that makes abortion safe legal and rare and reduces the number of abortions it's amazing to think that that was just in 2008 Hillary Clinton said abortion should be safe legal and rare which of course doesn't make any sense if abortion is morally similar to murder then it shouldn't be legal and if it's not morally similar to murder if it's just a procedure to remove a part of your body then there's no reason that it should be rare but classic Clintonian example of saying two things that have different sides of your mouth by 2016 not many years later the Planned Parenthood was selling baby parts to the highest bidder and the Democratic Party was cheering them on pretty sure that you actually take just tissue that first apology or you can find it exactly right what what is what we can use what is intact so that's why I'm saying no don't lowball I want you to be happy were those undercover Planned Parenthood sting videos I want a Lamborghini don't we all those videos they are almost cartoonishly evil they're really just to the core evil it's amazing that some Hollywood screenwriter if a Hollywood screenwriter had written that and turned it in well forget the politics of Hollywood but if he had turned it in for a movie about this it would be thrown out for being too on-the-nose that a woman is going to sell body parts and haggle over the price so that they could make more of a profit it sounds like a horror film it died actually it sounds like a horror film and so in May Nancy Pelosi came out and suggested that the Democratic Party would support candidates who weren't strictly in favor of abortion if there were some candidate who's a Democrat and all the other ways but as pro-life they would consider giving them money Pelosi wants that big tent as they call it Chuck Schumer came out and said that he's in favor of that big tent even governor Moonbeam our own governor here in California the the once and future Governor Jerry Brown he came out in favor of supporting pro-life candidates but the former DNC chairman and failed presidential candidate had a less favorable view of that let's cut to Howard Dean for his reaction not happy he did not support that move at all he said that he would not donate to candidates who were pro-life he would not support those candidates he wants to keep the the Democratic Party pretty small now Planned Parenthood CEO is Cecile Richards along with NIR all and all of the other pro-life advocacy organizations were predictably infuriated here's her reaction I thought I was gonna make it through that with that breaking it is amazing that they put her on TV she's so unlikable I don't know why they would ever put her on TV like that now why are the Democrats doing this there are two words Donald Trump Donald Trump won five states that the Democrats have won four to two elections in a row Brock Obama won all five of these states twice Iowa Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania and Wisconsin those happen to be states where social issues matter and it turns out that you have just the devil going on TV it's the board of your candidates it doesn't play that well in Peoria now Republicans are basically unified on this issue 68% of Republicans are pro-life and that is the same for men and women 68 percent of men 68 percent of women interestingly the more educated a Republican is the more likely he is to support pro-life the more likely he is to oppose abortion a 71% of college graduates who are Republican or pro-life the number dips down a little bit below for a postgraduate degrees but the trend line is is obviously in favor of pro-life as Republicans are more educated Democrats are totally split on this issue Democrat a pro-life according to Gallup is 32% men are 35% women or 30% so Democrat manners are more likely to be pro-life and women as Democrats are more educated that number actually decreases though for a pro-life and 29% of white Democrats are pro-life but 39% of black Democrats of pro-life so that the minority vote that Democrats are always sucking up to and pandering to actually opposes their rigidity on the issue of abortion now this presents a real problem for Democrats because a lot of their issue in the last election was that they came across as elitist out of touch with the regular American Hillary Clinton wanted to kill they seem to toss the issues of the middle class in the lower classes completely out the window to suck up to Hollywood celebrities and to suck up to the the latte-sipping limousine liberals did not play well for them and though in particularly in those five states so the March for Life has been getting larger every year things have been moving in the direction of pro-life anyway but the country remains split on it this is this is great for us for the country and for Republicans in particular for two reasons there's the moral reason if the Democrats are supporting pro-life candidates that means that we'll probably get more pro-life politicians politicians who are less likely to be extremists on the issue of abortion on the political issue though it will split Democrats so if we can wedge an issue in there with them then Republicans are more likely to win those elections and Republicans generally are more pro-life anyway so it's a win-win situation to discuss this we have to bring on our all-male panel of deplorable z I figure when we're discussing an issue like abortion it's very important to only talk to men so we have we have Jacob Airy from The Daily wire and of course his Eminence Paul Bois to give us his opinion on it Jacob lots of people could take credit here President Trump could take credit those undercover Planned Parenthood video creators could take credit Trump's reaching out to new voter demographics we could give them some credit who deserves all of the glory for making the Democrats give up it or move slightly to the right of their currently sacramental view of abortion I honestly think it's actually pro-life democrats who deserve some credit for this i have several friends who they vote they are in principle democrats but they vote republican because of the life issue they they they can't stand Cecile Richards they can't stand Planned Parenthood they know the backstory of Margaret Sanger a radical racist who wanted to exterminate the Negro population her words and I I think that they gets they shouldn't receive some of the credit because they've been pushing this party in this direction after they after they left it so I really feel that they when they voted for Trump they said hey we want our voices to be heard and we have to get trump elected we're gonna do this you bring up a great point in Margaret Sanger people should read woman in the new race that's that's an essay by her book by her that does sum up this really spooky eugenicist position on abortion but there yeah there there is a lot of glory to go around on moving Democrats a little bit back to moderation on this issue publi his your eminence when did Democrats begin to take this sacrament of you of abortion it wasn't so long ago that pro-life democrats were welcomed in the parties and i right no no no no actually not the democrats pretty much adopted abortion into their platforms in 1976 and 1980 and of course Mondale was pro-abortion and so was Dukakis Jimmy Carter actually however expressed several times even long after his presidency that he regretted enforcing roe v wade and so there was a climate of kind of that big tank pro-life democrats are allowed in the party and it wasn't really until 1992 at the democratic convention when the Clintons disinvited I do remember the Clintons being around in 92 yes yes and the Clintons disinvited Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey from speaking at the convention in Robert Casey was a big-time pro-life Democrat and he was a big time member of the party he was his name Casey was the Casey in the famous Supreme Court decision Planned Parenthood v Casey so by having him get disinvited that was really when the new trend of the abortion litmus test set into the party should you blame the Clinton in that way yeah it's the Clintons and I think them getting defeated is a wonderful thing and it may end that a litmus test finally I'm happy to blame the Clintons for everything that that's perfectly fine with me we have to move on to much more important issues than the sanctity of life and human dignity a Greek life retreat at Ole Miss was canceled this weekend after a banana peel was found in a tree a student tossed the perfectly compostable banana peel because he couldn't find it garbage-can now according to the director of Greek life my quote many members of our community were hurt frightened and upset by what occurred a banana peel being tossed into a tree and felt it was imperative to provide space immediately to students affected by this incident Pawa who is at fault here is that the parents is that the administrators is it the students themselves is hit our terrible culture Michael I I'm just at a loss here I'm just gonna go ahead and say it's the banana peel really I typically on all of these triggering cases these microaggressions I find them ridiculous like and at least somewhat see the point or the flow of logic that they're making this I'm at a loss so I'm going to say it's the bananas fault we should just ban all bananas they're racist I agree my favorite fruit Jacob how do we fix the problem of snow flakiness it is really fun to make fun of these people they're out of their minds if they're triggered because some kid threw away a banana peel but how do we fix it how do we make students stronger and smarter and and less out of their minds I think the solution should be we should teach Western culture from a literary perspective I mean if you read a lot of like Charles Dickens the the masculine and the feminine characters are all very strong but here's but because these faculties placate to these snowflakes they're like oh well Dickens Shakespeare on and on and on they must be racist because they're written by straight white men or whatever and so I think my doubts about Dickens but sure but my but I'm just saying if we if we go back to teaching oh this is how if we go back to teaching that literature we we presented them good moral strong characters I think that they can be strong again it should go it should go back to teaching what their Western culture is all about then you have to read though it's a Dickens is very projects I'm one of the few Millennials who reads I guess you know absent you are and that's how it's gonna stay you make me sick I don't have time for that stuff okay we need to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube now and I know that what you're waiting for is to hear more of this panel I know that you want to get a blessing from His Eminence Beaubois but you can't do that unless you go to the daily wire.com right now and subscribe we want to thank all of the current subscribers it helps us keep the lights on in here it helps us keep refilling our leftist ears tumblers full of delicious salty leftist tears but if you haven't done that yet go over there it's $10 a month hundred dollars a year you get my show you get the Andrew Klavan show you get the Ben Shapiro show you get the leftist ears tumblr keeps your leftist ears hot or cold always salty and delicious it's a really great deal frankly folks we make the best deals over here so go to daily wire.com right now and we'll be right back the latest cover of the French satire magazine Charlie Hebdo reads God exists he drowned all the neo-nazis in Texas the editors at Charlie Hebdo might remember that their stupid magazine would be written in German if it weren't for us Paul surprise surprise Muslim terrorists murdered much of the Charlie Hebdo staff the United States is leading the global fight against radical Islam but these children over there these rude people have decided to attack us they've decided to attack regular Americans why won't they give us a break and is there any satirical merit to making fun of hurricane victims well the reason why they won't give us a break Michael is because they're leftists at heart I mean I know we want to give them credit and they were attacked and that was a horrible horrible thing and we all rightly stood alongside them and they were brave enough to criticize Islam when everybody is running away from that issue but it doesn't change the fact that they've just been nothing but cruel and merciless towards Christianity and particularly Catholicism and the way they've painted it on their magazine and on the issue of whether or not you know you can do satire and hurricane victims look you can do satire on anything so long as it's tactful and it's funny I mean even that stupid political cartoon that was making fun of the hurricane victims at least had a little bit of tact in there this is just dead dead on arrival it's not funny it's not tactful it's akin to the Kathy Griffin holding Donald Trump's you severed head it's it's just a tasteless cartoon it's also a little ridiculous of them Jacob do they do the French have any credibility to call Americans Nazis Hitler sneezed and those guys surrendered is there any credibility to their accusations absolutely not and I want to make something absolutely clear to Charlie Hebdo when you were attacked by radical Muslims Texas Monthly didn't put a cover didn't put them cover mocking France on on their publication absolutely not and you know what 750,000 Texans went to World War two and rescued you so I don't even want to hear and 22,000 of them died my sister she is literally trapped by a flood of water my great-grandmother is in a nursing home and they're trying to keep the power on so those nursing home attendant are those missing home living patients don't die so shame on you Charlie Hebdo I am disgusted by this I'm offended as a Texan and you should apologize immediately this is the first time I've ever seen Jacob berry angry and you were you really got to do a lot to get Jacob very angry I'm sort of aroused great job charlie hebdo you've you've done the impossible you rude French dummies okay that's it I gotta get oh no I'm sorry there is one more story there's one word great story we have to cover body cam footage has just surfaced of an incident last year in an Atlanta suburb when a woman pulled over for drunk driving told the officer that she didn't want to get out of her car because she'd seen so many videos of cops killing people the officer responded but you're not black remember we only shoot black people we only kill black people right all the videos you've seen have you seen the black people getting killed not maybe not the classiest joke the officer could have made Paul left wing heads have exploded here is the outrage justified over these comments I mean look Michael you know I'm very very quick to condemn snowflakes and all of their phony outrage but this is definitely one I mean I know that the officer is joking and clearly is not clearly joking right I think some people yeah I could see there though I mean if I'm a black person and I hear officers saying like we only shoot black people yeah I could understand the initial outrage don't think the guy should lose his job no but I'm gonna cut some people having outraged a little bit of slack on this one that's Barry you think that you'll cross the line I wondered a little bit it is a funny joke though because I think people think that he's joking about black people being killed by the cops that's clearly not it he's joking about the narrative that is being pushed there have been study after study that has come out that has explained a way most of the disparities between black people and black suspects being killed by cops and suspects of other ethnicities and I think the narrative here is that there is a nationwide epidemic of racist cops go looking for the next black person to kill which is just simply untrue and if the joke is about that I kind of cut him some slack on it it seems to me that cops have been under a lot of attack over the last few years nevertheless not the sort of thing that one should say professionally and especially not when you're in a position of enforcing violence and coercion Jacob the officer was placed on administrative leave is that too harsh for a joke or does that punishment fit the crime I think in this case the punishment does fit the crime I don't think he should be fired I don't think that he should be removed as a police officer but administrative leave especially since it was just such as Paul was talking earlier it was it was a joke that lacked tack and I agree with you it was a little it was a little yeah very lacking a lot of tact and I agree with you it was a little funny because he was just kind of being sarcastic but I still think that yeah he's a police officer he he he should honor his badge and he and I think in this case he dishonored it so administrative leave I think is just right for him two jokes that just simply did not land for people you gotta watch your comedy guys okay panel you're out of here Jacob your eminence thank you very much for coming on now we have to get to the mailbag all right first question comes from Mike just discovered you here on Daily wire I'm a new subscriber and former leftist thanks for coming on over both to The Daily wire and to the right love your work but why the heck is your book not available on Kindle you know that this there's a big misconception about this my book

Brandon dearest Michael trolls best cigar under fifty bucks thanks kind regards finally a question I care about I have been doing this show for a month now and I haven't gotten a question that I care about nearly as month nearly as much there are a couple categories here if you're able to get Cuban cigars if you're traveling to Cuba or you're traveling abroad there are a number of great Cubans under fifty bucks the prices vary widely so if you go to Cuba the cigars are dirt cheap if you go to London you'll have to mortgage your house to afford any of them for the Cuban cigars I would recommend that Trinidad via the same Luis Rey exclusive Oh Cuba and the boulevard bella cosa fee no all tremendous cigars could be cigar of the year for non Cubans I would recommend which are available anywhere in the United States I've been smoking them for years and years and years I would recommend my father basically anything by them the blender is Don Peppino everything he makes is exquisite the padrone 1926 aniversario in 1964 anniversary are both good I prefer the 1926 it's a little pricey but it's an excellent cigar I love Nat Sherman cigars I'm from New York it's a New York local tobacconist the timeless series is very good if you can get your hands on the Gotham West Side that's my favorite that they put out and then of course Oliva series V and Series O or tremendous cigars I recommend them they're really cheap they're like seven or eight bucks a stick and I couldn't recommend them more I've been smoking them since I was a wee little boy next question from David mr. Noles who would you pick to star in a movie adaptation of your number one bestseller David is talking of course about reasons to vote for Democrats a comprehensive guide I recently rewatched gone with wind and I think I would have to use an actor from that film specifically the wind the scene that comes to my mind is from American Beauty it's that scene where the wind is whipping around and there's a little plastic bag just floating around and the kid he says this is my greatest work of art when I consider all of the reasons to vote for Democrats and that is the picture that I see before me and I would love it if a Hollywood director could realize my artistic vision for that film from George hi mr. Knowles I'm not sure if you saw in the news recently that Iceland is on the path to completely eliminating Down syndrome from its population through prenatal screening and abortion I think we actually mentioned this on the show a little bit we did we do at least on a panel this seems very Nazi asked to me it is especially since people born with Down syndrome could still have a high quality of life they can how would you argue with someone who thinks this is a good thing I would ask them specifically who would you kill of the people who are alive right now who have injuries who are maimed who have been amputated who have mental retardation of any variety I would I would ask them which of those people would you kill for whom would it be better to be dead than to be alive and I think that will shut them up and make them realize the flaw in this argument because in Iceland and for other eugenicist arguments here with a center their arguments around is abortion because of the fiction that if you kill a baby in the womb it hasn't really lived yet and you're not killing it you're just preventing it from ever having life but the reason we know that that little baby has Down syndrome in the womb is because it's a little baby that is living that we can run tests on and figure out what their life will look like to some degree after they're born so I would I would make it very clear that you are ending a life and if we go down this path if we say well people with Down syndrome they shouldn't live their life is so poor it which is not true by the way but they'll say their life is so poor it's not worth living for them then you have to ask well how where do we draw that line do we say that people who are born with limbs their quality of life will be too poor people who are born with autism their quality of life will be too poor people who are born with a predilection for the common cold is that will their life be too poor when we determine who has the right to live and who ought to live based on how beautiful they are how smart they are or how tall and athletically strong they are we're going down a really bad path that will will end in Oblivion and despair from Hendrick in California I unfortunately overheard two men discussing the killing of trees which leads me to the following questions if they are distressed about the murder of trees what do they eat for breakfast did they commit abortion by eating eggs or did they commit infanticide by eating alfalfa sprouts excellent questions Hendrick I got this a lot with my blank book because environmentalists would yell at me for wasting all of this paper you must remind them paper is an organic renewable resource we should use it we should print out these emails and that way the tree farms won't just become big parking lots in the middle of Washington State this does call to mind my favorite group of political activists they are the people who are vegan they're crunchy they're vegetarian but they support abortion those are two things that cannot go together there there people who what they won't eat an egg because chicken life is sacred but they will kill a second or third trimester human baby because human life is not sacred does not make a whole lot of sense perhaps you should bring that up to them from James good day Michael good day James here in Australia we're having this same-sex marriage debate and I was wondering what are the best secular arguments for and against gay marriage PS would you ever like to visit Australia PPS keep up the great work PS yes PPS thank you very much the gay marriage debate it has been totally wrongly framed on both sides but in particular on the left people view this issue as a civil rights issue who has the right to get married why do some people have the right to get married but some people don't have the right to get married I can marry any woman that I like any person that I love but as someone who's gay can't marry the person that they love this is skipping the first question in this debate is what is marriage and that's not necessarily a religious question obviously religions have quite a lot to say about that but it's a philosophical question it's an historical question it's a question that has always had basically one answer for the history of civilization which is that marriage is a union between one man and women at least women there there has been polygamy at various points in in our history but for the vast majority of that history it's been between one man and one woman and so the secular question that you can ask the philosophic question is what is marriage why is marriage why do we think of it as between a man and women or a man and one woman is there something about the complementarity of the sexes that defines marriage is the sexual difference inherent in what marriage is does marriage involve the possibility the potential to create a family the atomic unit of society if marriage is not about that if marriage is simply about sexual attraction or emotional attraction then why on earth would we prevent polygamous couples from being married polyamorous couples from being married why would we prevent marriages that involve more than 50 people if it's simply about attraction and living together and visiting people in hospitals and any other order of things that could be accomplished simply through contract law if the sexes are different if there are inherent sexual differences and if those inherent sexual differences play some part in our nature and in our society then the question of redefining marriage is a perilous one and should be taken very cautiously and not oversimplified as it has been at all levels right up to Anthony Kennedy giving one of the stupidest decisions in the history of the Supreme Court and saying that the only reason to oppose gay marriage is irrational hatred of gays it's slanderous and absolutely absurd next question from Lucy hey Michael you often joke about your Catholic guilt and seem to be ripping into Joel Osteen for his focus on mental positivity I hadn't heard of Osteen aside from the name aside from the time he was on Jimmy Fallon show but at first glance I would say his self talk style of preaching has both scientific and biblical foundation a perhaps cliche but obvious example being Philippians 4:8 do you think Christians are supposed to live ashamed what's your take on Romans 8:1 and Galatians 5:1 cheers Lucy I actually don't mean to rip into Joel Osteen as a figure in the culture or as a book writer or as a TV host I do rip into him a little bit as the leader of the largest church in America but as a figure I don't think he's necessarily doing anything particularly wrong let's go through those Bible verses that you brought up Philippians 4:8 finally brothers and sisters whatever is true whatever is noble whatever is right whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever is admirable if anything is excellent or praiseworthy think about such things wonderful advice we ought to do it all the time Romans 8:1 therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus also true Galatians 5:1 it is for freedom that Christ has set us free stand firm then and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery and Christ Himself tells us this in the Gospels follow me for my yoke is easy and my burden is light all of which is absolutely true and Christians should live joyously and joyfully you rarely see a frowning st. you see Saints who suffer all the time but they don't seem to be frowning too much because they're filled with joy even when they're grieving or if they're a little sad we sure certainly shouldn't live a shame we should live in joy in Christ and this is the issue with Osteen is that Osteen does not talk about Christ very much in his sermons or on his Twitter account he used the word Jesus or Christ 112 times out of over 16,000 tweets he doesn't have a cross on his altar in in his mega church so practically go with what works if Joel Osteen is giving you practical advice for your life which is by the way what he says he's doing he says he's not an evangelist in the traditional sense and I give him total credit for honesty if that's helping you in a practical way go with it go with what works theologically though I wouldn't focus on you a lot of old Osteen's books are living your best life now making the better you you you you and a man wrapped up in himself makes a very small package indeed you should do is live joyously looking at Christ as all of those verses allude to so I would make sure that we don't focus on sentimentality here I think that's what Osteen kind of goes into a little bit jesus wept it's the shortest verse in the in the New Testament Jesus wept and he wept rightly so your freedom was purchased miraculously at a great cost it was purchased at the cost of God the son being incarnate and dying on the cross being tortured infinitely literally dying and then coming back up three days later now when you think about why he died and the reason for what he died which is the sin of mankind I guess that's negative that's probably not the most positive thing to think about but when you think about it in that way then the miracle of redemption is much more awesome it fills you with greater awe and it fills you with a deeper and truer joy so I think we ought to view the world in exactly that way we ought to smile just as much as Joel Osteen if that's how the spirit moves us but it shouldn't be one that's based on saccharine or sentimentality because the CS Lewis points out in the weight of glory if you look for truth you might find comfort but if you look for comfort you'll find neither truth nor comfort only soft soap and wishful thinking and in the end despair so ground it in something real and look toward Christ for that rather than toward yourself and now the final question from Greg Michael the Clavin aid that's a nice nickname I'm excited for your new story podcast that you're working on with Andy millennial he's so in touch with our culture isn't he just raps about what all the kids are talking
