1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,500
Auto parts supplier Takata has declared bankruptcy,
but that was not a huge surprise after it

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,100
caused the biggest recall in US auto history.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,040
Roughly 120 million of Takata’s airbags
have been deemed potentially unsafe worldwide.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,550
More than half of those are in the United
States.

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:22,720
In fact, the U.S. recall is bigger than the
next five largest U.S. recalls combined and

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,039
affects roughly one in every five cars in
the United States.

7
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,360
So if you own a car made in the last 15 years,
there’s a good chance your car has a bad

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,360
airbag.

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,700
Takata supplied airbags to major manufacturers
like Honda.

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,950
And Toyota, And Ford.

11
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,600
And all these guys.

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,690
Takata and automakers haven’t decided how
to split the cost of years of recalls.

13
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,310
So what went wrong?

14
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,220
It isn’t just that the bags aren’t inflating.

15
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,980
When a car with one of these faulty bags gets
into an accident, the airbag can explode.

16
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:03,130
They use a chemical called Ammonium Nitrate
as a propellant, but over time it begins to

17
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,489
destabilize.

18
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:08,980
The casing that’s holding the ammonium nitrate
breaks apart, and it does so so violently

19
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,080
that it ends up sending metal shards flying
into drivers and passengers.

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,860
Eleven people in the US alone have died from
Takata airbag shrapnel - almost all of them

21
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,020
in the southern part of the country.

22
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,200
It turns out long exposure to heat and humidity
are what’s causing the Ammonium Nitrate

23
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,350
to destabilize..

24
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:32,550
Takata admitted to hiding the danger posed
by its exploding airbags in a plea deal with

25
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:38,180
U.S. prosecutors in February in which it agreed
to pay regulators, consumers, and carmakers

26
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,810
$1 billion in penalties.

27
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,710
You can go to this website (safercar.gov)
to see if your car is on the list using the

28
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:49,570
car’s 17-digit VIN number, but if it is,
be prepared to wait.

29
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,780
It could be a while before you can get your
car fixed.

30
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:58,820
Since airbags on each make and model of car
are unique, replacing 64 million of them requires

31
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,729
a lot of parts that are in very high demand.

32
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:05,830
Completing all of the recalls may take well
into 2020.

33
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:10,119
The huge cost of of the airbag crisis finally
brought Takata down.

34
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:16,450
In June 2017, The company filed for Chapter-11
bankruptcy listing more than $10 billion in

35
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,450
liabilities.

36
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:22,580
Most of Takata’s assets will be acquired
for around $1.6 billion by a Chinese-owned

37
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,770
company, Key Safety Systems.

38
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:29,740
The money from that sale is expected to help cover ongoing costs related to the airbag recalls

39
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:34,320
Meanwhile, as drivers wait for their airbags
to be fixed -- they’re left with cars that

40
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,860
are potentially dangerous to drive, all because
of a device that was put there to keep them

41
00:02:38,860 --> 00:00:00,000
safe.
