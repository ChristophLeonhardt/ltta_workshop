$1.6 BILLION, ONE 15TH FOR THE PRESIDENT WANTS. SHANNON? Shannon: PETER DOOCY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OUR NEXT GUEST HAS PLENTY TO SAY ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND THE FBI HEARING TODAY. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM SELLING THE DOJ IG TODAY HE IS NOT BUYING AT THE CLINTON INVESTIGATION WAS "ON THE UP AND UP." REPUBLICAN FROM SOUTH CAROLINA JOINS US NOW. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US, SENATOR. A LOT TO TALK ABOUT. LET'S TALK IMMIGRATION FIRST. THEY ARE TRYING TO GET SOMETHING DONE ON THE HILL. PAUL RYAN, HOUSE SPEAKER, SAID TODAY ON LOCAL RADIO IN WISCONSIN THAT HE BELIEVES HE'S GOT THE INDICATION FROM SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL THAT THERE IS HOPE ONE OF THESE HOUSE BILLS COULD PASS IN THE SENATE. WHAT IS YOUR TAKE? I DON'T KNOW. I HAVE TO SAY WITH A PASS. AS TO THE CHILDREN AS YOU COME I THINK THERE IS SOME GROWING CONSENSUS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO BRING FAMILIES UP BUT WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE ARE CAUGHT COMING HERE ILLEGALLY, THEY SHOW UP FOR THEIR COURT DATE. THAT IS THE DILEMMA. IF A FAMILY IS CAUGHT AT THE BORDER, MOTHER AND FATHER AND THE CHILDREN, I WHAT I WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT THEY STAY TOGETHER, BUT THE PARENTS SHOW UP FOR THE HEARING, AND THEY GET DEPORTED TOGETHER, THEY BROKE THE LAW. Shannon: THAT'S A TOUGH ONE. HERE SOMETHING IN THE DHSS SECRETARY NIELSEN SAID. OVER THE LAST YEAR, 300% INCREASE IN UNACCOMPANIED ALIEN CHILDREN. TEN OF THE 12,000 WERE SENT HERE ALONG WITH OTHER PARENTS. LAST YEAR, 435% INCREASE IN ILLEGAL FAMILY UNITS COMING. OVER THE LAST DECADE, SHE SAID, SINCE 2013, MORE THAN 500,000 ILLEGAL MINORS AND FAMILIES THAT WERE ADMITTED HERE FROM CENTRAL AMERICA HAVE DISAPPEARED SOMEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. Shannon: HOW DO GET THEM TO SHOW BUCK UP? WHAT WHAT I DO WITH THE UNACCOMPANIED MINORS, THEY ARE NOT FROM MEXICO. I WOULD WORK TO MEXICO TO HELP THEM KEEP STOP THEM AND MEXICO, THAT IS WHERE THEY COME THROUGH. THAT IS ON MEXICO COULD HELP US WITH THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION PROBLEM. Shannon: THEIR OBLIGATION WAS, WE HAD WITH THE CARAVAN COMING, AND MEXICO, THEY THEY WERE HELPING GIVE THEM SAFE PASSAGE TO THE U.S. BORDER. I WOULD TELL MEXICO, IF YOU WANT TO BETTER TRADING PARTNERSHIP, BE A BETTER PARTNER STOPPING THESE PEOPLE, PUTTING THESE FAMILIES AT RISK COMING TO AMERICA, AND WE ARE THE BAD GUY. WHAT I WANT TO DO IS HAVE PEOPLE APPLY FOR ASYLUM IN THEIR HOME COUNTRY, JUST DON'T SHOW UP AND I ARE. GO TO THE CONSULATE OR EMBASSY IN YOUR COUNTRY AND APPLY FOR ASYLUM THAT WAY. Shannon: ONE OF THE DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE, ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE, SENATOR BLUMENTHAL, HAD THIS TO SAY ABOUT THIS WHOLE SITUATION TODAY. THIS POLICY OF FAMILY SEPARATION REMINDS US OF THE CATTLE CARDS OF NAZI GERMANY WHEN CHILDREN WERE SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILDREN AND MARCH TO THE SHOWERS. ALL I CAN SAY, I DON'T THINK YOU ARE A BUNCH OF NAZIS. THE BORDER PATROL, YOU ARE DOING THE JOB THE BEST YOU CAN. WE'VE GOT A SCREWED UP IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. LET'S NOT DEMAGOGUE, LET'S FINISH IT. SENATOR CRUZ HAS A PRETTY GOOD IDEA. YOU HOLD THE FAMILY TOGETHER, YOU EXPEDITE THE HEARING, SO THE PARENT HAS TO SHOW UP. WHATEVER THE JUDGE RULES, YOU EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY. THAT WILL PREVENT A LOT OF OUR PROBLEMS. I THINK SENATOR CRUZ HAS A GOOD SOLUTION. WE'LL SEE WHERE IT GOES. Shannon: YOU SEEMED TO BE HAVING FUN ON THE HILL QUESTIONING THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT INSPECTOR GENERAL AND A FBI DIRECTOR. DEMOCRATS TODAY REPEATEDLY HAMMERED ON THE FACT THAT ALL OF ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A FINDING OF BIAS WITH A NUMBER OF THE FBI AGENTS INVOLVED WITH THIS INVESTIGATION OF THE FINDING WAS THAT THAT NEVER IMPACTED THE DECISIONS THEY MADE WITH REGARD TO THE INVESTIGATION. THAT'S RIDICULOUS. WHO MADE THE DECISION NOT TO PROSECUTE? THE FBI. ASKED, IF YOU BELIEVE THE FBI'S JUDGMENT WAS CLOUDED, WHICH THEY FOUND, BUT THE DECISION NOT TO PROSECUTE, YOU CAN'T PROVE THAT WAS A RESULT OF BIAS, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DID NOT MAKE THAT DECISION. COMEY DID. WHAT DID WE LEARN TODAY? WE LEARNED TODAY THAT THE HEAD INVESTIGATOR OF THE CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION HATED TRUMP'S GOATS, TOLD HIS FRIEND, MS. PAIGE, WHO WAS IT AN ATTORNEY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, ON AUGUST THE EIGHTH, DON'T WORRY, HE'LL NEVER BE PRESIDENT, WE'LL STOP THAT. THEY CHANGED THE MEMO THAT A COMEY ROAD TO THE COUNTRY ON JULY 5TH, THEY TOOK THE WORD "GROSSLY NEGLIGENT OUT AND PUT "EXTREMELY CLEAR LIST." I ALWAYS WONDERED WHY. GROSSLY NEGLIGENT IS A LEGAL TERM THAT WOULD MAKE YOU SUBJECTIVE TEN YEARS IN PRISON FOR GROWTH, GROSSLY NEGLIGENTLY HANDLING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. ON AUGUST THE EIGHTH, THIS NEW EMAIL TELLS US ALL WE NEED TO KNOW, THAT STRZOK WAS INTENDING TO STOP TRUMP. HOW CAN YOU STOP TRUMP IF YOU THE REASON MAY CHANGE THAT WORD IS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO INDICT CLINTON IF THEY DID NOT CHANGE THE TERM. SO WE LEARNED A LOT TODAY. WE ALSO LEARNED THAT THE NUMBER TWO AT THE FBI, ACCORDING TO STRZOK AND PAGE COMMENCED AT AN ON A MEETING IN AUGUST TO TRY TO FIND A WAY TO CHANGE THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION. THAT'S J. EDGAR HOOVER STUFF. IMAGINE THE NUMBER TWO GUY AT THE FBI HAVING A MEETING WITH THE LEAD INVESTIGATOR, AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS, THE WHOLE IDEA OF THE MEETING WAS TO FIND AN INSURANCE POLICY TO BRACKET, AND PROTECT THE COUNTRY AGAINST TRUMP WINNING PARTY THAT IS WHAT J. EDGAR HOOVER DID. Shannon: DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU GOT ANSWERED TODAY? HERE'S WHAT I FOUND. I FOUND THAT SOMEBODY IS LYING. McCABE SAYS HE DOESN'T RECALL THAT MEETING. TO STRZOK AND PAGES THAT HE WAS IN THAT MEETING. I WON'T GIVE UP ON US. IF THE NUMBER TWO GUY IN THE FBI HAD A MEETING WITH PEDRO AND STRZOK AND HIS OFFICE TO FIND OUT HOW TO CREATE AN INSURANCE POLICY AGAINST TRUMP BEING ELECTED, THAT IS ABUSE OF THE HIGHEST LEVEL, THE GOVERNMENT THAT IS WATERGATE STUFF, THAT IS WHAT THE FBI USED TO DO. I WANT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT. Shannon: TO YOU, THIS IS THE BEGINNING, NOT THE END. THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING THAT I NEVER DREAMED COULD EXIST IN THIS COUNTRY. I'VE HAD AN OPEN MIND ABOUT THIS, I TRUST THE FBI COME ABOVE THE FBI. BUT I LEARNED TODAY WHAT THE FBI AND DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DID IN THE CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION IS DANGEROUS TO DEMOCRACY. SHE GOT AWAY WITH IT AND THEY WERE OUT TO GET TRUMP COMMANDER COULD BE SOMEBODY NEW NEXT TIME, SO WE NEED TO FIX THIS. Shannon: ACROSS ALL PARTIES AND POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES, PEOPLE
