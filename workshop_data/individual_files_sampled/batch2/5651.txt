director Pompeii what did you learn from your conversations with Kim jong-un I'm just here today director could you say anything about what you learned from your meeting with Kim jong-un in North Korea director do you think they are committed to denuclearization CIA director Mike Pompeo on Capitol Hill today chased by reporters asking about his recent trip to North Korea where he met the dictator there also being asked about his currently shaky chances of being confirmed a Secretary of State those things it turns out are related this is fascinating politico.com now reporting that last night when it leaked that Mike Pompeo had gone to North Korea and met the North Korean dictator that leak was deliberately timed by the White House to quote shore up Pompeyo image as a diplomat capable of executing sensitive negotiations on the president's behalf basically they're trying to shore him up so we can get confirmed as Secretary of State Pompeii was nominated to succeed fired Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State he's due for a committee vote very soon as soon as Monday perhaps but he doesn't appear to have the votes it looks like Mike Pompeo will be the first nominee for Secretary of State to not be able to get a vote out of committee in over 90 years if he does fail that vote in committee Senate Republicans say they plan to just put his nomination on the floor anyway but if they do that nobody knows if he will have the votes to get confirmed Pompeyo in trouble and it's not just him this afternoon the Trump nominee to lead NASA barely advanced following an unexpectedly dramatic vote Arizona Senator Jeff Flake initially voted against NASA nominee Jim bridenstine which resulted in a 4949 tie that would have usually brought in Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie in the nominees favor but Mike Pence was nowhere to be found and so everybody leaned on flake to switch his original no vote to a yes which allowed the nomination to proceed if not jeff flakes dignity today we also learned that the confirmation hearing for Trump's nominee to be next CIA director Gina Hass ball that has been pushed off till next month at least amid bipartisan questions about her record on torture a confirmation hearing for Trump's nominee to lead the VA White House dr. Ronnie Jackson that will take place next week but he faces lots and lots of skepticism in the Senate including from Senate Republicans about whether he has anything near the management experience to oversee that agency so a whole bunch of the president's cabinet picks are having trouble right now but none more so than the highest profile job of all Mike Pompeo up for Secretary of State working senators furiously on Capitol Hill today Handy's had the White House leaked details of this North Korea trip to try to save his flailing nomination but he still has a real mountain to climb Moorhead tonight stay with us hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
