so that you would find out about our stance on all kinds of issues that are of interest for you and your countries and for Russia these discussions at this forum have always been characteristic by various opinions being represented often conflicting opinions even but that's one of the advantages of this discussion club or debate club how we call it because where you have only one opinion that is considered to be a right there is no room for discussion and a discussion is only possible when you compare and juxtapose various approaches various assessments and opinions and thanks to your participation we are able to do that here I see a lot of internationally renowned politicians in the audience today I would like to greet all of them including former presidents such as the president of Afghanistan and our colleagues from the Eurasian Economic Cooperation Organization I see people from mass media people of art and others here in the audience I hope that today's meeting will be interesting and also helpful thank you I am however a little bit confused by the format today because usually we have several people sitting on stage and the discussion usually takes a long time I am of course prepared to go solo as the organizers have suggested but I hope that this meeting this talk won't have to go four or five times longer than usual and now without much ado let's get down to our deliberations okay will not be five from six time as much as usually but might be twice as much I can manage that suppose you said it correctly that we need the diversity of use and we have it here well die discussion meetings and it's quite a representative audience you see and it's expanding and I mean not only the quantity but also the new countries which are joining our discussions let's make situation different this year we had a very informative agenda and there was one subject one topic which we usually did not discuss that much Russia before that we talked about Russia's that much during the tenth meeting that was a huge discussion club gathering you were there as usual and we've decided to come back to the title not because many were asking to discuss this not only because of that that we've prepared a report on this and we believe that some major shifts are happening in the world not only some transformation but still we are seeing that many lose understanding of what are the pillars of our world we almost gave up we can say for sure that we have gone past the point when we could manage the world control the world and today small countries big countries have to rely on themselves only I have to ensure the stability their own growth and this is why we should really look into whether we are ready to be that why independent and self sustainable or not and that is why it will be nice to talk to you about this unfortunately the work we been doing was largely a very tragic event yesterday who heard about the tragedy which happened in Kerch yesterday you said it all you express your condolences and we also express our condolences during our session yesterday one thing which came to everyone's mind was here we have another terrorist act unfortunately we've grown accustomed to it turned out Association was different but still why am i calling these things because that takes us back to the very first well dye meeting mention that yourself it took place I made a very tragic background of the terrorist action vislon I've been there there back then and discussion Club meeting was not very consistent because people were leaving the audience to take a look at what was happening and back then he met the participants of the club but during the sessions itself you had a televised address which was very very harsh in terms of words you said that's a quote which I remember well many remember well one want to get a piece of our country others help those who get something from our country they think that Russia is one of the biggest nuclear powers is still a threat that is why that threat should be neutralized they believe terrorism is an instrument which helps them achieve their goals later on meeting with members of the Valdai Club you said that this was a challenge and you're going to stand up to this challenge have we responded to the challenge what do you think that is rather lengthy forward last year we had our fourteenth of all day forum and I think I can hear better this year I would like to start from what you started what from yesterday's tragedy this is most likely a result of globalization strange as that may sound on social media on the Internet we see entire communities created it all started with the well-known tragic shootings in u.s. high schools where young people who are mentally unstable creates false idols false heroes for themselves and that means that all of us not only in Russia but globally we don't react promptly to the changing realities around the globe we don't create content that would be helpful and interesting for young people and so they have to grab this surrogate of heroic images and that leads to tragedies like this one and there are their Israel heroism in our everyday life and one of the areas for showing such heroism is protecting the civilization from devices of today one of which of course is terrorism in order to efficiently combat terrorism and I've said this on many occasions including the generalists the UN General Assembly in New York the only way to efficiently combat terrorism is together through unity and so far we've been unable to do that to its full extent there have been efforts but so far they have not been enough they've not been sufficient we have not really joined our forces and our efforts the way we should have and that's possible based on international law and the necessary resolutions of the United Nations so answering a question we have achieved the results we had wanted to achieve starting from the tragic events that we witnessed in the mid 90s in the early 2000s we have mainly achieved our objectives let's think back to it so we tend to forget bad things rather quickly of course everybody likes to think of good things but back then there was essentially a civil war raging in Russia it wasn't nationwide it wasn't going on nationwide but there were engagements it was a direct warfare using air forces artillery there were a lot of armed groups in Russia largely manned with people from foreign terrorist organizations such as people from al-qaeda who were rather active in Russia thankfully we have eradicated that but we have not gotten rid of terrorism as such it is still a significant threat in Russia and that is why we have started active operations in Syria because terrorism is an important threat to our neighbors such as Afghanistan whose president mr. Karzai I see in this audience and if we give him the floor he will probably tell us about the developments in his country today where terrorism is a significant threat so globally we have not defeated terrorism so far but we have delivered heavy blows to it and we have taken heavy punishments we have brought heavy punishments on it and changed its positions and standing here in the Russian Federation all naturally will be appropriate now to talk about about that meeting which took place in 2015 and it to place two weeks after the military operation in Syria started one of the colleagues asked a question remember it question is should we really carry out the decoration of the glasses lost of life and expenditure and you said something which became very very famous lunch when I was growing on the streets of Leningrad if you cannot avoid the fight you should strike first we did this three years of past association has changed fundamentally but still the situation is quite dramatic we've seen some positive trends we've seen some negative trends and I'd like to probably repeat that question maybe we should have gone there seen people die there we'll remember it I do remember that query and it actually the question was are casualties possible and I said they are possible but we must prevent the worst case scenario and the worst case scenario would have been total isolation but terrorists held territories in Syria and total degradation of statehood there and if an infiltration of large numbers of militants from those territories into Russia and neighboring countries with which we don't have don't essentially have borders with with which we have a visa-free regime and no it's actually no customs authorities in place that was a real danger and through erection we have largely prevented it from becoming realities because we have delivered a heavy blow on terrorists in Syria we have eliminated many of them a lot of them have given up on the further fighting they've lay down their arms they have lost their faith in their earlier held beliefs and convictions so I would call this number one but what's equally important is we have helped Syria preserve its statehood and thereby we have preserved stability in the entire region just yesterday I spoke to the president of Egypt and he shares this outlook and many countries and heads of state share this outlook as well so I believe that we have achieved our objectives largely that the objectives that we had when we started the military operation in Syria but look at the overall situation countries that undertook to participate in those counterterrorism operations maybe with the self-interest what has been their result what achievements have they had in over two decades almost nothing we have liberated about 95 percent of Syrian territory from terrorists we have re enhanced statehood in Syria we have prevented it from crumbling of course there are still problems what's going on on the left bank of the Euphrates River you probably know that that territory is really controlled by it is under the patronage of our American partners who put a stake on Kurdish armed groups but still Isis militants have a foothold and they've started to enlarge it they've captured about 130 families which is about 700 people and they're holding them hostage they've presented an ultimatum and said that they will be executing ten people a day if they our demands are not met and the other day they actually did execute ten people through a firing squad that is a disaster and something needs to be done but our Western partners are keeping quiet about it and as far as we know the terrorists have captured several European and US Nationals but so far everybody's keeping mum about that so indeed there's a lot still to be done in Syria but I believe that we have largely achieved our objectives the next stage for Syria of course should be a political settlement under the auspices of the United Nations in Geneva right now what we need to do what Syria needs to do is form a constitutional committee and there is progress even though it's not as fast as we'd like it to be but we'll keep moving on you said that part of the militants lost faith they realize they are wrong they were wrong are you sure that they lost faith maybe they just realize that they are outnumbered they cannot win there is no way they kind of win and maybe station changes they come back that is possible you might be partly right some of the militants indeed lay down their weapons and some probably sincerely concluded that their previous goals their previous convictions that were false and some of them probably have decided to lay low for now to abuse the humanitarian initiatives yes in order to be able to take up arms at a later time this only means that we should not underestimate terrorism and we should ramp up our joint efforts to combat terrorism and financing terrorism if I might on the 15th of October there was the deadline set forward by Turkey while completing the activities in Italy have they completed everything complies with the obligations no so far they haven't but they're working on it and we can see that they're working on it and in this regard I would like to thank our Turkish partners we we are seeing that they are actually working on it it's not all that simple quite the contrary it's all complicated but they are working on their commitments and the DMZ which we agreed upon in the Italy de-escalation area 15 kilometers deep it is being established not all heavy weapons have been withdrawn from it not all militants in the members of terrorist groups such as Isis or Japan and Neutra have left that area but our Turkish partners are doing everything they can to meet their commitments it's not all that simple and we see that they've even deployed a military hospital to that area because they are having casualties but they're acting in a tough way and the rather efficiently in fighting those terrorist groups thank you well I would our favorite topic it permeates every meeting we have a lot of colleagues from the US and the topic of the u.s. well we cannot but speak about this issues in 2016 you said one very interesting phrase right after crisis in Ukraine and after the crisis in Syria someone asked you from the audience maybe it is the time to lower the tensions and you said we all seek alleviating the tensions but that is not gonna happen through our funerals if you want to pay for alleviating the tensions with the currency of our funerals that's not gonna happen no funerals just yet but I think some I still would like to see that happen experience communicating with the US presidents and really a lot of things that are happening but all those things that are negative not positive at all maybe I'm wrong but the meeting was Donald Trump they lead to well opposite results I was it to those which are expected maybe we should give up trying we should take it polls so let them sort out their own mass inside the country you know there is this video joke maybe some of you still don't know it question how do you relax answer I'm not generally strained I'm not tense and that goes for tension as far as international relations are concerned we don't put anyone under stress we don't create problems for anyone it is us who gets accused by others saying that it's highly likely as they like to say that we have meddled somewhere or did something else but at the same time no one bothers to present any evidence for me it is clear and I've said that before that's this is a result of political struggles of what domestic politics in the West and also our various domestic disputes political strife among Republicans or as or in Britain as regards brexit and playing this Russia card is a very popular tool but it's damaging for everyone I hope it'll pass at some point but it seems that we need to wait until those domestic political crises are settled in those countries whether that will happen in the u.s. after the midterm elections maybe or maybe that will happen in 2020 after the next presidential election in the United States and then the president won't have to keep looking to those people who speculate using anti-russian rhetoric whether our meetings with President Trump were helpful I believe that despite all the efforts to discredit those meetings they were other positive rather than negative because we see what's going on you know we can read and we read media sources and we are watching what's going on domestically in the United States as far as politics go but of course it is better to be in contact with each other and to communicate rather than fight each other and have constant rows but I believe that as far as domestic politics in the u.s. goes of course it hasn't gotten any better after our meetings with the president Trump someone keeps trying to use those to their ends but president Trump is still insisting on stabilizing the us-russia relations and we'll see where it will head in the future but we are prepared for improving those relations at any time can you hear me better now a lot of books have been published about Donald Trump it's interesting to read and the English which has been created well he's a man which listens only to himself does he listen to you that is not true about him maybe he is like that with someone else but then it's their own fault as for our communication with the President Trump we have a professional dialogue and of course he does hear you I can see that he doesn't only hear you he reacts to what you say he can agree with you or disagree with you on something the same as I can disagree with him on certain issues we have different approaches we have different opinions but that's normal that is a discussion between two partners and I don't subscribe to this view that Trump doesn't hear people talking to him you know among the experts political scientists use your topic is one you there is a deadlock in relations and look like we're facing that deadlock it is useful to have sobering crises in relation with it when both sides come to understand that the threat is real we should take a step back from that drink like the Cuban Missile Crisis and some say maybe we need that kind of crisis now so that the US would well diverge from the inner problems come to realize that the stakes are very high and it's time to do something positive it's a bad idea Daniel Stamm of kissteria increasing an aggravating tension and ramping up hysteria that's not our method as they say and you know bringing the entire world to a brink of a global crisis with results that are impossible to forecast that is not our way and we'll never use that kind of politics well a very resistive response I'll give one more you quote we're talking about the air defense system you said Russia is not afraid of conflicts well station has changed what are the conflicts were not afraid of today we're not afraid of anything a country with such a large territory with such a defense system with people like that who are prepared to stand up for their sovereignty and independence not every country has this proclivity of its people to sacrifice themselves such preparedness or readiness to sacrifice themselves for their motherland not every country has that but we do and that gives us confidence all right you said we're not stirring any trouble for anyone some people in the whole camps probably argue the opinion is that Russia causes a lot of trouble when is later how long is it gonna take let's start now otherwise how long do we have to spend here all right I get it if we are not there any troubles but certainly there are parties which cause trouble to us of course they do they try their best to one more famous kimoto views Russia is a bear that's the metaphor everyone knows and bear is not asking for permissions bears the massive tiger not going to migrate to other climate zones and never going to give up on a huge tiger that should be clear for everyone point-blank so about our taiga does everyone understand that this is it it's our taiga it's always been like that you know this is it and we're having that now as well but we're living in a world who is the global security he relies on nuclear potential and Russia is one of the world's largest nuclear powers and I said that publicly that's in response to the creation of for the u.s. global missile defense system we decided to improve our own systems and some of them have been completed some of them will be deployed in the nearest months and I mean the avantgarde system it is a fact of life recognized by experts we have surpassed all of our partners and competitors in this area as regards high precision hyper sound weapons no one has that some countries are only planning to test those a year or two from now and we already have it in our arsenal it's already it's already at our disposal and therefore we feel much more confident therefore of course there are many other risks and challenges such as climate change proliferation nuclear proliferation global terrorism those are all challenges and you know proliferation of nuclear arms if we don't check it it's also if it knew clear weapons will end up in the wrong hands such as terrorists and it will lead to a disaster but of course that Russia has a large territory we're not afraid of anyone we don't want anything from anyone but we value our sovereignty and independence it's always been like that in our history it is in the DNA of our people and therefore we feel confident I'll speak about the fact that we don't need anyone from anyone some would argue of course me right Crimea is something of ours something that's ours it's not ours because we came and grabbed it and those who would like to dispute this those who would like to argue with me on this such a debates would be dead ended right away we're all Democrats here what is the Mack democracy its power of the people how do you see the the will of the people through elections through referenda the people of Crimea came to a referendum and they voted in favor of a being independent from Kiev and B becoming part of the Russian Federation I'd like to remind you that there was no referendum in Kosovo it was only the coast of a parliament that voted for splitting off from Serbia and everybody who wanted to support that said oh we agree we accept those results but they don't accept the results of the Crimean referendum oh let's look at the UN Charter let's look at the UN documents yes you can look at the UN Charter where where the right to self-determination of Nations is attested we can debate for a long time but it is about the will of the people living in that territory and they manifested it clearly speaking about the people just we call this back in 2010 during that very session was the first was the 10th meeting and almost here 2013 you quoted sergeant Nelson and one of his biggest idea was that saving people is way more important than anything else the world of today see it's very high competition for people for so the minds of people human capital it's more important than any territories or anything and misogyny Turner took part in one of the sessions in your opinion we're talking about conflict some classical concepts but if we talk about competition rivalry in terms of the minds and souls of people are we ready for that competition will win it I believe we are we largely are you see in the front rows of the audience the head of the broadcasting network Russia today what's going on in some of the countries were they broadcast their offices are being shut down what does it mean that means that those people are afraid of the competition we're not chatting anyone down here in Russia but in those countries they prevent this network from performing their functions as a media outlets they create obstacles to them and that means we are winning over we only have one radio station we only have one network where we don't have a monopoly in as far as global media goes we don't have networks such as CNN Fox News or the BBC we only have one media outlet with rather modest capabilities but even if it draws such fear and enmity through its influence on people that means we are achieving our objectives I know that in France they don't like you very much if I get to Paris if you invite me I will visit our tea offices in Paris and be I'll be glad to see how you guys work there that would be good yeah thank you very much oh let's continue I think this is a very important subject to discuss your historical speech well it has become historical a 2014 it's called the Crimea speech by some Crimea back then came once again part of Russia so you were appealing to the notion of the Russian world and combatives nation divided that was very impressive I was touched but you touched upon some very very complicated things you stood up very special feelings feelings of national identity attitude towards ourselves our country our territory states can be a good instrument store bad weapons it depends and we've seen a lot of things happening in the Russian world to you and we see these negative things continue in life take the church in Ukraine and I'll be some other bad things will be happening so let me be bought don't you agree that you decided to make that move don't you regret the results we have honestly I can't really understand your question I think it's natural we should always raise this question we shouldn't lose track of it our national identity is what makes us who we are it's about our culture and our history and this preservation of the people which you spoke about taking a quote from Solzhenitsyn it's it's also about culture and preserving our identity if we lose it we will cease to exist you can find a lot of examples in history but don't you remember the names of the tribes and nations that existed back in the day and that have become obsolete why should we go this way we would like to be Russians or tatars or moldova or all those other ethnic groups we have over a hundred of them living in the territory of the Russian Federation and we need to reinforce our identity and you said many times including during our meeting systems yes this club that any kind of chauvinism to use a huge blow to the very nation very people she's being cared for and back in 2014 you said that the biggest nationalists in Russia is you yourself are you still in Nationals yourself I see you have taken your time preparing for this and you're doing your best trying to catch me on something there is no contradiction here I will tell you what I meant nationalists they keep what they keep emphasizing is that they are the best protectors of the interests of a specific ethnic group or nation whereas the Russian Federation Russia ever since it's early days came to be as a multi-ethnic country as a multi-ethnic state we have with us today a lot of people who are professionally involved in studying those issues I see here the director of the Hermitage Museum even though he is an expert on the Middle East but he knows he also knows very well how the Russian nation came to be it's a didn't exist forever you know it was formed by various Slavic tribes you know there were no Russians up to a certain point and then this suddenly and then they at some point they emerged based on a common market under the rule of a certain Earl or Prince based on common religion such as the Orthodox Christianity and then when statehood began to form you know in the earliest on the early stages of Russian statehood there were a lot of Finnish in yogic tribes that also became part of it and we're now finding a lot of historic evidence that Filipino yogic tribes lived not only in the northwest of what's today Russia but also in central Russia in Central European Russia's so Russia originally appeared as a multi-ethnic multi-denominational two villages country and it became this way initially it managed to develop this way because there was tolerance towards the representatives of various ethnic groups or religious groups that was the basic of contemporary Russia and if we want this basis to be preserved and to be developed and if the Russians are the state forming ethnic group in Russia we must abstain from assaulting and baiting other ethnic groups because the Russian people should be interested in preserving Russia as a unified state and if we start beating other ethnic groups we will lose that and I as I would like Russia to be preserved as a unified state because I am full Russian interests that is the kind of nationalism I meant not the wild uncivilized nationalism that will lead to a disintegration of Russia are you alone do you have any no alive thinkers I have likely might be people almost at 164 million and the 46 million all right mr. Putin we agree that we should preserve Russia but you said something very harsh you keep grabbing onto whatever ever said that's my job will they continue to have our discussion one on one or because we have other people here in this audience there's time for everything so can you please explain you said it why do we need a world without Russia many had their own views it's like after us anything can happen maybe you had something different in mind well no first of all louis xiv when he said you know after us is the flood he was actually responding to accusations that he was spending too much money too much money from the budget on building palaces and holding balls but actually he wasn't that much of a big spender because after him many palaces were left to the successors as heritage and also he was in status annotators yeah he was the creator of europe's first regular army by the way so he wasn't all as bad in what he said doesn't mean that he actually acted in this manner that was just their polemics him debating other people as for what i said we were discussing with you topic which I don't quite remember right now you shouldn't take things out of context to remind you we were speaking of whether we are prepared whether I'm prepared to use our weapons including weapons of mass destruction for the protection of Russia and its interests and I was responding to that and I'd like to remind you what actually said I said in our concept of using nuclear weapons there is no such notion as a preventive strike and I would like to request all those present here and all those who will be reporting on what I'm saying and analyzing every word I say or using what I say for their own narratives that please take note of this fact that Russia does not have the concept of a preventive strike in its doctrine for using nuclear arms we only consider it consider using it in response that means that we are prepared to use nuclear weapons only when we have hard facts that a potential aggressor is striking on Russia on Russian territory with nuclear weapons now this is no secret we have prepared a an early warning system we have created it and we keep improving it this system analyzes globally worldwide where launches are being made including Oceanics surface they identify where missiles are being launched from secondly their trajectory and the point of impact all this is being identified and analyzed within seconds and so only if we identify through system that missiles are being launched at us only that will we deliver a retaliatory strike a strike in response only when there are missiles airborne being launched at Russia of course that would lead leads to a global disaster to a nuclear catastrophe but Russia cannot become it's a instigator or initiator because we don't have a preventive strike in our as part of our military doctrine of course once someone has launched nuclear missiles at us it would be maybe too late to stop them but a potential aggressor should know that there will be retaliation and we will get to heaven as martyrs and our enemies will simply die as dogs because they won't even have time to redeem themselves and I would like to address reportin take him but maybe a bit later I will do that well maybe you grew tired of me maybe just one one little question and then we'll have a Q&A session just a follow-up to what you said meaning all that counter-attack and where each of us will be going afterwards yesterday we've had a wonderful session mr. gurgi he is wonderful composed an artist he's also very socially active person he is an activist himself we talked about many things he said that his opinion was that three countries three leaders bear the responsibility for the world you say Russia China clear cut it any way you want so these countries can either achieve something or maybe well do something positive or do the other thing so there are three countries which have the potential which is bigger than the potential of any other country good sense or bad sense but being a person with that kind of responsibility you're one of these three ever feel afraid I'm scared what do you mean by by terrified I mean terrified yes because you bear the Front's ability for the whole world so watch no I'm not afraid okay I have no questions then then genuinely you know this this is not a simple question because fear is the reverse side of something that is natural for any living creature this instinct of self-preservation everyone has this instinct instinct of self-preservation and one of its manifestations is fear it's a way of reacting to danger to a possible threat but you know when I just started working in security forces after universities and then working in intelligence we had this rule or principle when you start working on something you have to figure out what it is about what it's related to and once you start working on it you must work without being haphazard or dashing about it you must be circumspect but you must not be thinking about your personal individual self-preservation you have to be careful but you should not be thinking of your self preservation that is very important that is essential for people who are responsible for the security of the entire country of their nation we've already thought back to the tragic events of the late 1990s or the 2000s I remember flying over the city of Grozny which was razed to the ground during the fighting and there were people shooting at us from every rock on the ground we had to fly real low to hover real low on our helicopter to avoid being shot at to shut down I had never seen previously helicopters flying so low and so fast it could it could be scary at some point but that was my choice and today it is also my choice and I think it is the same for all of our colleagues and of course they might have their second thoughts but if you've made a choice you must act without looking at the possible negative implications for you personally you must think about the consequences for those who you're working with for well fear is a double-edged sword it's something inside you but it's also a means of manipulating do you think that's that kind of enjoyment it is a bad incentive it is a bad way of managing people because it's unreliable the best tool for governing and the counteracting with society is convincing them and positive motivation it is important that people that you communicate with it must be a joint effort for you in them it must be joint work those who make decisions must not distance themselves from those who are supposed to implement those decisions all of you have to work on implementing that and then we will be good results thank you ok let's do something all together now please you have the first question Vladimir Putin decided right that Russia is not sharing any troubles for others but in China we have a saying that woods would like the forest would likes to be silent but the wind never lets us be quiet in tranquil that's true both China and Russia I've been labeled they are saying we are states with revisionist de OSes China and Russia together with Iran and North Korea I've been labeled most dangerous address race of the most peaceful country of the world of all times of all people there are sanctions and Russia there is a trade war against us the situation is very serious again if we recall what a famous Hong Kong movie featured one of the words uncle uncle is very disappointed consequences will be terrible for you well then our future is one for two countries and I would like to ask you something how will Russia respond to this can you recommend anything to China and thank you so much my dear friend and colleague I think that China is no less a great nation and a great people than the nation you were referring to the Chinese civilization is ancient and grandiose I don't think that China really needs our recommendations but I can share my point of view with you you've quoted this Chinese proverb the forest would like some peace but the wind won't let it have any but I can say weather tends to change the time will come and the wind will die down I think that you shouldn't react hastily to everything that's going on in a way that might aggravate the situation but of course you always need to react to protect your interests and actually that's what we do both China and Russia and the reason I say that weather taste tends to change and winds tend to pass those who create those winds they also suffer from the consequences you've mentioned trade wars and sanctions it seems to me I probably won't say anything new for some of the people in this audience experts will see what I'm talking about but certain rhetorics in the US it's really dictated it's really prompted by their domestic politics and let's look at their political calendar they have this midterm election right now and soon they will be having a presidential election they need to preserve the current upwards trends in their economy and in the midterm perspective such rhetoric in such sanctions as such measures can have a positive effect but in the long term there will be bad ramifications coming because everything that is being done now affects the global economy and it is never inevitable that it will affect its regional or national economies right now our trade with our experts to the yes is about 500 billion dollars and it is between if it continues it will reach 1.5 trillion it will be one of the reasons for further for a further downturn in the global economy and it will affect everyone so you can instigate wins but it is certain point it will become damaging even for you and therefore I think that the the Chinese civilization is ancient and the Chinese have a lot of patience and I think that's the capabilities of the Chinese economy they really enable you to withstand all of that and the Chinese economy is now bigger than the American economy in absolute figures per capita the US economy is still ahead the the US economy is high-tech in it's very quick about implementing innovative state-of-the-art solutions and both Russia and China still have something to work on and still have something to learn from our American partners but everything changes and the global economy is changing and the growth rates of the Chinese economy are very high they've been somewhat adjusted lately but they're still high and at some point it will lead to a situation where the the composition in the global economy will be changing even though the these actions are creating a certain danger for everybody not just for China talking about the wind let's talk about a East then do you expect any questions what kind of question do you expect to see I have no idea are you going to ask me about the islands again that's not interesting excuse me I cannot buy us place two years ago in this very hole I ask you the following question what are the chances that there will be an atmosphere which would be allowing Russia to sign a peace treaty maybe in the upcoming two or three or four years back then you reply to me it is impossible and even harmful set any deadlines because at this point it's not enough trust between the countries to do that well in September bringing a plenary session at the Eastern atomic forum which took place in Vladivostok you suggested that Russian Japan sign a peace treaty by the end of the year now without any preconditions that's what you said can you please explain us now does that mean that we today have enough trust between each other to do that to sign a peace treaty it means something else thank you indeed I said that we need to increase mutual confidence what I'm going to say is not really an insurmountable obstacle but nonetheless we are talking about strengthening confidence signing an agreement achieving a compromise as regards territorial issues which Japan keeps bringing up even though we believe that that those that dispute is non-existent but we still don't refuse dialogue at the request at the behest of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe a we are providing opportunities a simplified facilitated visa regimes for Japanese citizens who would like to visit those territories visit the cemeteries and the terms of their ancestors so for our parts we try to strengthen that confidence and the mutual trust of Japan and Japan has introduced sanctions against Russia is that a stop step toward building confidence do you think where is Japan and where is Ukraine or or Europe for that matter so tell me was that done to strengthen confidence but still despite that we don't refuse contacts we don't refuse dialog with Japan your Chinese colleague just asked me a question and you know Russia and China used to have a lasting discussion as regards territorial issues it took 40 years can you imagine that during that time there's been different stages in Russia in Chinese Russian relations but we still arrived at a situation where we were able to sign a an agreement on friendship and we reached a level of relations which was unprecedented ly well even though we had not resolved our territorial issues completely by the time but you know once we signed that friendship agreement was that the end of our deliberations on our territorial issues of course not but it provided an enabling environment for actually finding a compromise and that's what we eventually did we found a compromise and we signed an agreement as regards territories and that's exactly what I proposed to Prime Minister Abbey if we sign a peace treaty now without resolving our territorial issues it doesn't mean that we will just throw away these issues and forget them completely that actually means that we'll be able to address them and our example with China proves that first we created this enabling environment of a mutual confidence and then we were able to resolve the territorial issue now for over half a century we've had this stalemate with Japan unable to move forward let's sign this peace treaty and move on in our ballots bilateral relations without creating more problems and will continue debating those territorial issues and discussing them we don't refuse to but Prime Minister Abbott has his own opinion and we later attended the youth judo tournament with him and we continued this discussion informative with him and he tells me that such an approach would be unacceptable for Japan today that first we need to resolve those paramount territorial issues and only then would be able to discuss a peace treaty but really within we've been in a stalemate on this for 70 years and there is no end in sight we're talking about joint economic activities joint economic operations on those islands between Russia and Japan there is a positive idea but its implementation has been very limited but we're prepared to work in it in the future thank you your eminence taken please table I was honored to say ting had to do with culture cultural issues more precise who talked about a culture and its role and influence on the society today beginning of our discussion asked the question can we to grasp the idea of how we assess a culture of a nation society and a very interesting opinion was voiced back then maybe that kind of assessment would have to do with compassion I mean the overall culture not like some section or subsection of it that was probably debate on some very far stretch topics but what we saw happening in church we don't know what really happened but so the motives behind what that man did but we see that aggression is rising and tolerance is rising across the world and my question is as follows how would you assess the let's say outcomes of our roundtable because we believe that mercy charity is one of the key criteria to assess a culture when we talk about the state policies in the field of culture and we all understand that we cannot regulate culture the state cannot regulate culture that's correct and I only welcome this but can a state can government be after and wise in supporting all the positive historical spiritual values which have been established within our country these are the basic spiritual cultural values we need to protect right I think that's what we do if we were to depart from the last part of your question I think that the government should be very careful about doing it presenting opportunities to people with various opinions to formulate their opinions and voice them yeah Concordia knowledge and to compete with each other for example to compete with your outlook maybe that is rather unexpected maybe it's an unexpected thing for me to say but if but that's what I believe in I do sympathize with you but as a head of state I believe it is my duty to provide every citizen with an opportunity to speak their mind to express their opinion and Here I am referring to the first part of your question what is mercy one of the religious values in modern terms in contemporary terms it is tolerance at least one aspect of mercy is about tolerance and if we think that mercy and tolerance are really characteristic features of a culture then we must provide people with an opportunity to speak their mind and be heard talking about mercy and charity I think we have someone who should be the next to ask the question thank you very much thank you for giving me an opportunity to participate the present here yesterday we had a discussion a very important one it has to do with cooperation between society and the authorities thank you for giving me that kind of foundation for my question now during the first part of your discussion you were talking about I am a person presents a different part of life we will all die eventually one day we all die so I don't really understand it can happen differently in different ways I agree palliative assistance well you see we try to give as much love as possible to people who know that the end will soon come and they spent the time they have to say I'm sorry I forgive you I love you things we've been discussing so far these words after there was a death which has to do with aggression and hate she said we are not afraid they're not afraid to have that kind of responsibility we now occurrence we have a lot of people 18 million people afraid because very close they see people dying they close relatives they die because they don't have proper treatment and it would help been talking about these things for years you know about our priority project it was part of your decree and a lot of money was allocated last year this year too but this sum of money on it well percent with god only that much we could spend all the other sums will be getting back to the budget and later on that I probably have the right can we go back to this you say but you returned the money that means you don't need it that's not so so I would like say that Russia plays a very special role it has played that special role of the a Syria we discuss sanctions that's right we should also discuss people people have formed the country 80 million that's a lot 1.3 million people these people die every year because they don't have adequate treatment so maybe a priority should be caring about these people they afraid they're scared I would like to see them saying the same thing you said I'm not afraid they would say because they would see the country protect them help them this help it doesn't cost much see to help them protect them we don't need to cut the economy in half or get half of our GDP to do that but that takes some decision decision from you we need you need to make that decision very bold one is that and that's it probably I just want to see those people be as calm and confident saying I'm not afraid thanks to your support what do you see okay I'll take those documents I'll take those papers I agree with you entirely that our issues our domestic issues must be at the center of our deliberations and discussions at the lives of our people if we discuss war or terrorism or other challenges that is because that is the way our moderator Fuhrer actually formed our discussion so it's him to blame not me as for your issues of course this is a very sensitive subject and it requires a special attention and tactfulness on the part of the government but like you said the government provided that money and the fact that only 16 percent has been used or spent it only means that work has been ill organised and it doesn't mean that next time I'll tell you you know we've provided you with money and you didn't manage to spend it all so we won't give you any more that will never happen you can rest assured the money that the government provides for priority tasks it is often the case that they don't reach the end beneficiary and they return to the budget it doesn't mean that they will stay in the budget forever and never be assigned again for those purposes of course who will keep assigning them and providing that money but of course whatever the government does it will be it will be unable to resolve any issue a hundred percent because life is complex and it keeps throwing various problems and challenges at us and so there is a role to play for society and even for religious organizations because it is religious organizations and I premiere primarily refer to our traditional denominations that traditional religious organizations they provides this moral basis this mental basis psychological basis for each of our people so that they would feel confidence in the rapidly changing world but of course the government will keep addressing the tasks that it faces in the context that you were talking about so rest assured I will take the papers from you and of course because you have under spent it doesn't mean that we will deny you in the future I will look at why such a small percentage of it has been used that is rather weird okay some say you're a military but we have a very positive person here maybe the most positive person in the world it really impressed us during one of the sessions good afternoon I'm a farmer I make cheese and you know we've been saying these things so you quite often over the last four years I'd like to thank you for sanctions you know we've been arguing a lot you don't thank me you have the Americans too saying for that but we didn't know to thank you Obama Merkel just thank you okay for us this is Golden Age I invested a lot I sold my apartments my car everything and we are seen that breakthrough in agriculture the ruble has depreciated but that's good for us in subsidies what kind of cheese do you produce well we have all types of cheese now we are going global we'll be exporting to building into each other's places will be shuttered because you cheese is so tasty or quite the opposite it is very good and it is very cheap thanks to the current exchange rate of Robo you see companies are investing in Russian agriculture we have many partners from abroad Li building farms and I was asked a question what will happen in sanctions get lifted but will you do will that be a catastrophe or not my question is as follows will you continue paying so much attention protecting us if just in case sanctions go away and my personal question I'm a record holder I tried nine times to give you some cheese your securities are doing their job and they probably eat well too yes well they give you that cheese I even wrote a letter thank you for sanctions they said we would give it to you so did they eat it themselves they aided themselves what I'm going to tell you is not a joke I was presented once with several bottles of wine by my colleagues and my security people asked me mr. mr. president should we check them or will you drink them yourself and I said you guys check them because I don't really drink as for cheese and sanctions and the possible implications of those sanctions being lifted so far we don't see that prospect in sight so you can rest assure them and the longer it goes on the fewer opportunities will be to come back to the Russian market for those who have left it for those who have quit as someone working in productions you probably know that once you have ensured the quality and I'm sure you have because you are prepared to go to the international market so once you ensure quality you will always have better logistics you will always have a lower production costs then foreign producers who will have to import it here especially if you have good cooperation and good relations with the retail networks here in Russia then your foreign competitors will have very few chances of competing with you on an equal footing but still you of course of course you have to be prepared for competition and I need to say this you and you and I and I am saying you and I because we are facing were faced with the same objective and that is improving and developing our economy especially such an important area as agriculture we have to be fit for competition from abroad we cannot always rely or counts on sanctions or counter sanctions or tariffs and you know raising barriers for competition because inevitably it will affect the quality of your product so necessarily we need competition in the markets but at this point we need to enable competition among domestic producers here in Russia but of course the level of support from the government for agriculture will not go down we will keep increasing it thank you so much well since I have the opportunity I have some cheese just come and take it I have it okay why don't you bring it right now otherwise I will never actually get it it will never never reach me and you don't have it on you too bad thank you I am still hoping to get cheese from you what region area based in the Moscow region where is that's a head of cheese in storage yeah it's storage right there 24 years thank you it's not going mouldy because it's good cheese what's it called probably know it and you're working Germany's have that famous name wonderful thank you very much to your colleagues in Vienna Russia cheese is coming but their consumers will be happy all right let's have one more question now thank you my name is thank you sir yes my name is da-da-da-da-da I'm founder and executive chairman of Beirut Institute it's a think-tank for the Arab region with global reach so I have a specific question about three countries Egypt Saudi Arabia and Iran all Saudi Arabia of course the world is preoccupied with the development and I'm wondering what consequences or do you see that there may be consequences a on your part relationship Russian Saudi relations given that you've been eager to have good relations and beyond on Egypt you've had magnificent success yesterday with President Sisi did you agree also that Egypt would play a role in Syria particularly in rehabilitating the government of Syria with the Arab League and with the Gulf states and lastly on on Iran why mr. president don't you feel comfortable asking the Iranians to withdraw from Syria since you've said in the past all forces will go why can't you be specific that would help probably in bringing your own troops back home and maybe the public here would be more comfortable than being worried about their troops and also this is this is a big issue between you and the United States and I think I heard you say you would like to have good relations can you solve that can you feel comfortable to deal with the Iranian question and have better relations with the United States thank you sir let's start from the lab from the last part of your question from the issue of un you know it is better to be worried for Russian troops in Syria than to worry for Asian troops in Russia it is better to combat terrorists when they are far away rather than have to combat them in your own country on your own territory so we'd rather fight terrorists overseas than at home as far as Iran is concerned it's not really our our task to convince Iran to leave Syria both Iran and Syria are sovereign states they should work it out between themselves of course we strong relations with both Syria and Iran and moreover through deliberations and discussions with our Iranian partners that we have resolved some of the issues such as withdrawing strike systems from Israeli borders from the Golan Heights bets but as regards a full withdrawal withdrawal that is a separate issue and it should be resolved through a dialogue between Iran and Syria Iran in the United States we are also prepared to be part of that discussion thirdly for Syria to be able to stop using military assistance from its allies one of which is Iran it must have an enabling environment for preserving and strengthening Syrian statehood so those who would like Iranian troops to leave Syria they must provide guarantees of non-interference in the domestic affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic they should stop funding terrorists and using them for their own purposes and setting them against the legitimate Syrian government that is of course a complicated issue and it is a responsibility for all the parties that have been drawn into this conflict Russia's position like I said that after such issues are resolved and in part after terrorists are completely destroyed and defeated in Syria all foreign troops should leave Syrian territory and as Syria's own defense capabilities grow stronger and also in accordance with the requests with the willingness of the Syrian government those are the main criteria for foreign troops to leave Syria now as for Saudi Arabia I don't really understand what you are unhappy with indeed we have reached we have achieved their good relations friendly relations with Saudi Arabia so what is your concern could you specify please consulate the Saudi consulate there is a big interest world worldwide in investigations regarding the assassination or the killing of Jamal Hazuki the journalist who is our colleague and has been participant in the world I group so this is what I'm talking about right now of course you know there's pressure on President Trump that may reflect on the midterm elections and I know there are countries pulling out and a country's being concerned I mean media and others being concerned about continuing to be present in Saudi Arabia given the alleged alleged feeling that maybe some when the government may be involved in this atrocity of killing a shorty that's what I meant do you think it will impact your relations with Saudi Arabia at all and please don't forget that also the question about Egypt thank you to the best of my knowledge the missing journalist mr. Haji he was actually living in the United States he wasn't living in Russia his place of residence was the US and in that sense it is the u.s. that bears a certain responsibility for what happened to this journalist he chose the US as refuge when he was when he sought political asylum as regards this situation we should wait for the investigation to produce results how can Russia go and ruin its relationship with Saudi Arabia before we know what actually happened there in in Turkey as far as I know this man was one way or another a part of the Saudi elite he was related to people who are part of the Saudi elite and and looking at what's going on in the States between American elites we hope that it won't reach the situation that they have in Saudi Arabia but until we know what actually happened to that journalist how can we take action to undermine our relationship with Saudi Arabia if someone knows what actually happened and they're sure that it was a murder they should provide the evidence and based on that we will take necessary action and as for Russia I would like to tell you something certain steps from time to time are taken visa by Russia including sanctions based on false pretext when Russia is accused of something up to using chemical weapons even though Russia actually destroyed its chemical arsenals and the US has not even though they had undertaken such commitments so when what she's accused no evidence is offered but measures are taken against Russia such as sanctions and now you're saying that there was a murder in Istanbul and no action is being taken so I think we should really figure out some kind of a common approach a standard approach to such issues but like I said we spent many years working on our relations with Saudi Arabia and the fact that a person is missing it is a tragedy but first we must figure out what actually happened to him as for Egypt Russia has good friendly relations with Egypt recently we marked the 75th anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations between our countries and they're not just being restored with Egypt now but they have been restored they their quality is back we we are actively developing them we have big plans as regards economic cooperation primarily energy not just carbon fuels but also not just for fuels but also nuclear power we have provided a loan for up to the Year 2029 and those are very beneficial relationship for a nuclear power plant to the build in Egypt and that is also helpful for us yet because we are developing helping Egypt develop its economy and we're also providing Russian producers of nuclear equipment with with work we also recently received 525 hectares of territory of land in Egypt and we will be working on providing production facilities they're providing 35,000 jobs we count on attracting 7 billion dollars of investment there our initial investments for creating infrastructure will be a hundred and ninety million just to get infrastructure in place over there we work a lot a lot in the area of military and technical cooperation and purely military cooperation we have regular military exercises joint military exercises and I think right now there is a military exercise the joint drill in Egypt I think he just finished today or maybe it's still ongoing as we speak so we intend to continue developing our partnership we plan to do that and as for Egypt's willingness to be part of a solution for Syria we see such efforts there is the this Cairo platform uniting opposition forces in Syria and we see that the Egyptian government is trying to influence those groups positively convincing them to work together to collaborate with the deceivin government and of course compromise is the best way a practical question as a follow-up so you've settled that issue with the security and safety of flights above Egypt no not yet as you know we have resumed flights between Moscow and Cairo and on our agenda today is resuming charter flights to Sharmila hey Sharm el-sheikh and Hurghada we discussed this issue with the Egyptian president and I believe that these routes may be reopened in the new future but Russia's experts such as the Ministry of transports and aviation experts they need to do work with their Egyptian counterparts to make that happen we hope that that will happen in the new nearest future all right professor please Russian world talk about Asia Eastern wind Asia Pacific they will have Russia but this autumn Asian policy has been very important the East coming forums where the first time we've seen the leaders of the Northeast Asia leaders gather or except for North Korea as far as I know you are going to the forum in Kuala Lumpur many problems in Asia one of them it's a Korean problem we've seen some progress last year when we met we thought it we were on the brink of oh maybe now we on the brink of peace in your opinion what is it Russia can give to this process facilitates this process you know that between North Korea and do you say well relations has been tense Russian diplomacy has done a lot but maybe we can do even more than that helping with the issue of sanctions we have sanctions on ourselves and our trilateral project is suffering from sanctions maybe we should take some steps to address this you know the situation in the Korean Peninsula is evolving in a positive way in general and we we all see that like he said they were on a brink of war and now they're on a brink of peace direct contacts between the US administration and the North Korean government continues and we hope that they will continue to move on in the nearest future we've heard that a new summit is being prepared between Kim jong-il and president Trump we hope that it will happen and I would like to reiterate my position I don't think that such collaboration will be efficient if it remains a one-way street you know demanding total disarmament and denuclearization from North Korea without providing it with any security guarantees in return I think it doesn't really it's not really promising but you know if the North Koreans believe in what Americans promised them maybe that could be the best way to relieve tension maybe I don't know but as for Russia's possible positive role we could actually implement the tripartite plans that we've spoken about you know uniting our railways between North Korea China and Russia or having gas pipes through North Korea from Russia into South Korea or setting up joint ventures between our countries because you know joint activities joint projects in the area of the economy and economic cooperation it actually provides an enabling environment for political contacts and for strengthening security and we shouldn't forget that China has done a lot in this area we have a joint platform together with China I won't repeat myself because a lot has been said about it already but we will stick to those joint arrangements what else Russia could do it seems to me and I've spoken about this as well before I think an important thing would be to provide security guarantees to North Korea and here Russia also could play a role because it seems to me that such guarantee is for them to be really efficient they need to be international guarantees we are interested in the Korean Peninsula to be free from any actual hot war we are interested in peace being preserved there we are neighbors with the that that region we are one of the permanent members of the UN Security Council along with the US and China we could join to provide such guarantees in being part of that system Ilan Kyle please good afternoon just an outline to again ask you a question about Asia five years ago when you visit Kazakhstan China announced the Silk Road initiative two years after that in the river China made a statement on coupling the original Union and the Silk Road initiative taken together all the recent events in the field of international affairs rise of that trade war the US and China and as for these initiatives are they still relevant are they still that important maybe some new initiatives may come up and my second question in August you and your colleagues leaders of the Caspian States made a very important decision to adopt a convention which according to many is a constitution of the Caspian region what will be the further cooperation of that track as for the Chinese silk route initiative and everything that's related to it it's economic aspect Sam this initiative one routes one way from our good friend Chairman President Xi Jingping and I believe he is our friend it's not only relevant but I would say it is increasingly irrelevant leader because economic barriers and economic restrictions on the one hand the they are a pressure to the global economies and to national markets and regional markets but at the same time it provides us with certain windows of opportunity it means that Russia in this case can can get an additional niche an additional marketplace or an additional role for example Americans export soya to China in vast quantities and I think that now Russia will be entering the Chinese market with our soya and also may be providing opportunities for the Chinese to grow soya in Russia's Far East if they provide investment for that in the area of airplane construction China used to be a big-time buyer of the Boeing and Russia too but right now we have an active working process on on building large distant or large distance broad-winged the airplane air jet and working on large tonnage a helicopter we have a great volume of military-technical cooperation with China and we have agreed that we will not only be selling hardware to China but also transforming technology technology of course not to the detriment of Russia's security no one should be mistaken about that but I'm referring to the high of confidence mutual trust between our countries it is a cell food is very important for the infrastructure of this entire region and therefore we welcome the participation of our Chinese friends in developing the northern the Arctic maritime route as part of their silk routes initiative one route one way the Chinese fund is one of the stakeholders one of the investors of the Russian plant for producing liquefied natural gas in the Arctic that by Russia's Neurotech and the French tandem so this is actually a specific project which is already there and it's already operational this production facility is already operational and due to the fact that sanctions are being imposed this initiative is not doesn't become irrelevant on the contrary it gains a new meaning our trade volume our turnover with EU countries actually it's been increasing it's it went down at some point almost twofold but now it is growing but our turnover with the Asia Pacific nations is growing at why it's twice that is growing at a much higher rate and the share of the European Union in Russia's exports is 42% in Asian countries Asia Pacific countries their share is already 31% and still growing of course we're interested in providing an infrastructure primarily transport infrastructure to that end of course we're interested in expanding transit and the BOM rail routes and of course we expect the volume of fright to increase four times up to 80 million tonnes along the Arctic maritime route all of that is naturally related to the Chinese silk routes initiative and with Russia's and with the development of the Eurasian Economic Union which kazakhstan is one of a key players in so we're helping with the developments in this area and will continue to work in this area actively with all our partners in the future and during substance off please Kimo Institute for International Studies mass media has started saying that a number of countries are conducting biological weapon elements and experts the long being asking themselves anyone we seeing us laboratories for biological weapon research is being located in some third countries and former minister of civil security of Georgia presented some documents the biological Convention prohibits that kind of research how reliable is this data and what measures can be expected I can't really judge how reliable it is I I've seen the statement of the former defence minister of Georgia and of course it is alarming if such a work such research was being done or is being done it is very dangerous it's related to the latest latest genetics research and from what I've seen I can only say what it's about it's about certain substances being identified which can affect people in a selective way based on their at background and within a generation or two and there are tests there experiments being done on animals on dogs and rats genetic cycles are rather fast and in the second generation you see mutations that change even the outlook of the species completely and if that is true as regards that research in Georgia of course that is highly alarming how we should counteract it we all need to be aware that action equals the counter action nothing goes without a trace if someone is doing that they should be aware that others will be doing that too and so at the onset we probably need to sit down and work out the rules of conduct in such a sensitive area if I can kindly ask you this thing okay your Slough is symbolic here please during our discussion he talked about they need to reorient trade routes towards HS can they be using some other currencies not the dollar can we well refuse using dollars in our trade we'll have different opinions by fin Russia and internationally people argue about this the role of Dola has been well very high maybe even exaggerated so there is some room for utilization but the volatility of emerging markets makes it problematic to refuse using dollar so what is European about the utilization of our economy well first of all we don't have to reorient our export flows from Europe to Asia it's happening naturally we didn't do anything officially we used to have a volume of trade with the EU at the level of 450 billion euros now it's under 300 it's like 280 even though there is growth last year it was 23% this year in the first eight months of this year it's it's already 22% with Asian countries our mutual trade has been going at a slightly higher race so in the structure of Russian of Russia some foreign trade them like I said Europe Europe's share is 41% and the asia-pacific share is 31% and if this trend continues maybe they will be equal at some point as for using dollar for foreign trade I'm not the only one who has been addressing this issue even the president of France recently spoke about that he said that Europe should increase its economic and financial sovereignty what does he mean by that departing from the dollar in international payments and France is one of the largest foreign trade partners of the US i-i've already said that our American partners are undermining their own economy because they are casting doubts they're undermining trust in the dollar as a as an international means of payment that is a very common mistake of empires empires always think that it can afford certain mistakes or excesses because it is so powerful that nothing can really undermine it but there is a moment when quantity goes into quality when such mistakes amass and build up to a point when they starts to produce in an impact whether that's in the area of economy or security and right now our American partners are undermining the dollar as a global reserve currency and you know the EU countries would like to trade with Iran they don't believe that Iran has somehow violated the terms of its nuclear deal with the West but the US would like to to sanction anyone who deals with whether Iran and has a trade with Iran but why would European companies that like to lose their business in the States so some of the European companies will quit the Iranian market but and will quit them cooperation with Iran but some will stay because those who don't have a business in the States and therefore they are trying to invent a new system of payment similar to Swift and they are increasingly tending toward the payments in their national currency that's your rights that national currencies are highly volatile that is inevitable but instruments are being developed that decrease such volatility for example without the within the framework of the BRICS there is a pool of national currencies there is a joint BRICS bank established of course it is incomparable to the IMF for as regards its capabilities but still these are developments in that direction yes currencies are volatile but if you keep addressing it and now they are addressing this issue permanently there are elements of hedging risks such elements of insuring against risks were hedging risks they will be invented and certain instruments have already been invented with certain countries to secure yourself against certain risks you can find certain anchors to strengthen yourself Russian companies of course are not interested in giving up the dollar especially Russia's oil companies they're not prepared to adopt national currencies for their payments but once such instruments are invented you will see such a transition and as soon as that happens a dollar will will be faced with very with a very difficult time as a universal means of payment as a global reserve currency we will certainly be moving in that direction not because we'd like to undermine the dollar but because we would like to secure our own economic positions because we are constantly being sanctioned and they prevent us from working with dollars and that's why we had to reduce our gold and currency reserves in their dollar equivalent because of that why they needed to do it is a mystery to me they could you know move toward their objectives without undermining their own currency the dollar but still in the u.s. they are moving in that direction and I think they're making a mistake in the hole we have people who know how to leap without any dollars and use some Jaipur the control of Syrian government second people United States emerging who were responsible for invasion of Iraq and no cons there are some actors in the region who really want a military confrontation bringing us to a broader major confrontation how do you see the picture and how would be the US response do you feel there there is more neutralization in the region and this militarization need to be contained thank you you know that better than I do the cause of all problems in the Middle East the root cause is Palestine Israeli settlement no matter how you look at the Middle East in the final analysis this is where we get that's why we need to do everything we can to resolve this issue so that there would be direct contacts between Israel and Palestine so that multi multi lateral efforts to resolve this crisis would restart it's going on for decades now that's one thing all right there are new crises related to terrorism and the activities our American partners do not contribute to the improvement of the situation in this area on the contrary we all know that but let's a bit for the hundredth time you said the attack on Iraq and the result the grown growth of terrorist threat due to the weakening of their statehood that's what happened what about Libya there's no state there anymore these are just groups armed groups that exist they're fighting with one another it's a disaster the DA figures to say that Libya was this surmountable barrier for migrants from Africa to Europe used to say what are you doing you are destroying this wall and they did destroy this wall and this is what's happening and they're looking for someone to blame there they have them same only themselves to blame if you don't like a certain regime in a certain country all right it could happen but to act like this by destroying the existing regime without offering anything in return or by offering something that for a certain nation due to their historic course is unacceptable could not be implemented it's absolutely immoral policy irresponsible policy that leads to such results without interfering in the affairs of other countries we could of course like someone or support someone but it should be based on the internal processes in the country itself yes it requires patience it requires a delicate approach to the situation as it's developing but it cannot be otherwise when you try to impose from the outside of anything on anybody leads to really heavy consequences as it happened in Libya on or in Iraq this is the result of the monopoly of this unipolar world that they're trying to build at a certain point luckily this uni polarity this monopoly is disappearing is almost gone I think it's very dangerous including for the monopoly itself because they're losing their guidelines and they you get the sense that you get the sense of impunity that you can do anything and it's always a dangerous leading to hard consequences at least at a certain level when we deal with the Syrian crisis we have had some some working a rather efficient interactions between Russia Iran Turkey even though our assessment of the situation is different but we could do it we have established pretty good relations on the working level with all participants in this process including the u.s. it's a gently the American military behave much more responsible is than some of their politicians and so that some conditions to to improve the the joint work authorization is always bad it's a volatile region where no turkeys claims against the United States that has been arming different groups we see what has been happening and I said on the left bank of your Freitas what is Hoover happening there arms are supplied monies paid to the military groups and they haven't been able to eliminate this threat all together 700 people were taken hostage it's a disaster unfortunately these things mr. president you've been speaking about monopolies but in the United States back then at the market monopolist one bundle that officially probably in in politics which would result these practices as well you know things now it is said about Istanbul tragedy and unbundling these are grave developments about some quasi hardline action and life will make us working concerts to the late joined threats common simpleton question about Russian public opinion as is well known since you became leader of the country all those years ago in 2000 you've you've had very steadily positive ratings in the eyes of your fellow citizens approval of your work in office is usually higher than 60% and sometimes as high as 80% so this is quite extraordinary but Russian sociologists also ask questions well a number of other questions but one in particular which is very interesting and that is about a question about the direction that the country is taking and if we look back we have this information all the way back to the nineteen nineties there's often a rather large difference or gap that is it's very very commonly has been the case that support for you personally coincides with many Russians actually thinking that the country is going in the wrong direction now after 2014 the so-called Crimea bounce occurred your your ratings went even higher than usual but at that point for several years more Russians a lot more Russians thought that the country was going in a positive direction and not in a so-called to peak but this has changed this year all of a sudden it seems more more Russians think that the country is going in the wrong direction even as they continue to support you so what is your interpretation of this disparity excuse me I don't see any disparity no I'll clarify what I mean most importantly 90s and the 2000s that you mentioned who can like those times it was the collapse of a huge great country and many people disliked it in Russia as well as in the former Soviet republics just ask their opinions they have their own interpretations but still they think that in the USSR they had the most stable existence and had more promising future there and the things have been changing and they can feel and the the benefits of sovereignty back then back then all that happened was at the upon the initiative of the Russian Federation I'm in the early 1990s when we hear claims and accusations I respond it was us who did that the the the the former leadership of Russia but soon was Russia first this is first second no one wants to go back to 1990s out of those who can recall still recall what was the case back then a full collapse of the economy of the welfare of the healthcare rampant crime and there was no education there was polarization of of common people and back then the main advances of the past years are only about stabilizing the internal and political situation or overcoming the most acute issues of fighting terrorism on our own soil had a civil war in progress hostilities as I said no one wants to go back to that time I'm sure but the main thing is that they call me well we've been able to return to the economic growth recover that and the people's living standards have risen well definitely yesterday things were a bit better now bit worse but anyway by and large the the income of our people has changed for the better that still we have a lot of people living below the poverty line line and in the course of the crow o8 downturn the share went up a bit but at the turn of the century was 40 percent of people living below poverty line now much less let's take the oh wait downturn the living standards went down a bit known like that and I'm aware aware of that with respect to the Crimea yes in Russia I believe it was a fair action by President and the government because historically that country had always belonged to Russia and people wanted to go back to come back to Russia which is what important some people tried to turn a blind eye on that but you know the the response and opinions of people are the main indicator that it is fair now the government is conducting a number of painful but necessary measures with respect to the retirement age and pensions in all the countries it's all the same no one is going to like that and I understand why they are not content but you know our people are clever smart they don't like it but they know that the government has to no other choice unless we do that today we'll do it tomorrow anyway we'll have to by 2024 we'll plan to have the life expectancy at 78 years and by 2030 is going to be 80 years of mean life expectancy anyway we'll have to raise depending the retirement age now have the transition period if we do that later will not have that neither benefits nothing and to smoothen this transition I came up with a proposal like if a person has reached the pension age he or she will not be retired but will use the benefit for like paying the whole house bills and taxes and other things they will have all the benefits at hand and most of our people believe it's inevitable they know for fraud nothing to be happy about but still they have this understanding it is a key point people should have confidence in the warts that the government has been doing and I believe that we haven't lost this feeling and this feedback I believe this is the main fact of our domestic political life I've been the future of Honda bag stalls thank you Sabina Fischer Valene mr. president I want to follow up on the Russian society debate last week the Civic initiatives committee public public reports saying that in the Russian society appetite for change has been increasing which has been reflected in the recent opinion polls what is your vision of the change in in public sentiment what do you want to do to respond to that I think it's absolutely natural like people want change don't german people want change let's look at the outcome over the Bavaria election it's so clear whether they want to change a lot in Europe everybody wants to change the United Kingdom voted in favor of brexit unbelievable but they want change we want change as well here the divorced majority of our nationals I don't don't want the revolutionary change no roughing up with revolutions we've had plenty of them in the 20th century and we have had them over the top in our newest history so anyway what we need is to have the timely change what we have been doing by the by and in close contact with this civil society which is the main guarantee of our in the success of our internal policy mr. president do you want any any any change personally I want us to to conclude the debate discussion because I must I must be off force Becca Stan and I want to play hockey before that quite appropriate time to ask just several more questions Thank You mr. president I think who wouldn't have the the full-fledged talk but let's mention Ukraine without that wouldn't have a complete discussion today sergey victorovich discussed the homeostasis situation in great detail but we'll do our - some words of optimism and the authorities of my country have been doing their utmost to deadlock the issues the United States and their personal Walker put their shoulder to assist that and the Normandy format is at a standstill and nothing has been happening there do you think maybe in in a midterm there may be chances to have your things unlocked and and ironed out it's a festering sore wound in our relationship I will just have to repeat what I said before we know that the thorniest issue here is the dawn bus crisis and I think that many will concur like organizing terrorist attacks and assassinations of representatives that have been selected elected by the Pope local population to rule these regions on the part of the special services of Ukraine is the worst way to get along well with those territories the best ways to deliver upon the Minsk set of measures no no one made them subscribe it's a trade of document one could rattle on for hours but you know the Ukrainian authorities of today are not going to implement the Minsk arrangements because of their political situation the forthcoming presidential and then parliamentary election that ties the hands of all the political forces any step towards the opposite side and you know better than I do will be deemed as high treason can one count upon the execution implementation of the Minsk set of measures measures within this context we should only desire and wish one thing there should no be no temptation there should be no temptation to aggravate things and use the aggravation the internal political struggle in the interview of the presidential and parliamentary elections this is what thinking about and this is our plan maximum and the Russian Federation wants the full fledge definitely recovery of a relationship with with Ukraine and currently the Ukrainian regime is not merely dead looking the situation they're conducting an anti state and anti public policy the same way it was trying to be done by Saakashvili in Georgia he tried to do the same by attacking the South Ossetia as a result of those criminal basically criminal actions Georgia has lost significant territories as a result of soccer Sheila's actions this is the result of his work very sad if today's equating authorities would follow in his footsteps I hope that that would not be the case but what has happened over the past time in social sphere in economics what's happening there what we see is the industrialization of the Ukrainian economy there was basically no investments coming there just talking about investments nothing using is taking place in reality how can he work with the economy that is always shaken for some kind of shocks or undermined by domestic political crisis and there is also a war hysteria being a monger and all the old things have been destroyed where is that shipbuilding industry that Ukraine was proud of where is the aircraft building industry which was created by the whole Soviet Union throughout decades what about space shipbuilding it has also been lost and the same goes for every part of Ukrainian pride of the past and what's happening is what I have been saying I'm saying it and just out loud here but I wanted to ask you rather rhetorical questions why did our Western partners need that especially the previous leadership of European finishin why did have to insist in such a hard choice of hard engagement of Ukraine in the European Association what did that give to Ukraine the open market so they're asking for Ukraine to bring around timber but it's not Siberia three or four years of work and they go into this all of the forests and now Western partners are asking for GMO products in agriculture then we'll have to close up borders because GMO is prohibited in our country now they they going to take our tourism the the black earth soils out of Ukraine therefore I believe the today's policy of Ukrainian authorities is aimed at what what are they trading with their trading russophobia anti-russian sentiment there is there are no more Goods there and they're being forgiven for everything so that because the nightmare of our Western partners is that Russia and Ukraine cooperating in any way because they think that will be a growing competition in the world as a result of such cooperation but we don't have the claim for that we just wanted to have normal work why do they have to open up Ukrainian markets without giving giving anything in return demanding from the Ukrainian government constantly to raise the prices for gas they understood that the purchasing power if the population is not so high they used to gather it just peanuts for it for the gas industry before and now they're basically gathering and gathering nothing all benefits or pensions are at zero so we're gonna have to wait for the domestic political cycle to end and I truly hope that with a new leadership of the country will be capable doing at least some kind of relations and agree on something we're prepared for that and we want that Thank You mr. president for this large and deep discussion pleasure I am in politics for 40 years I have never seen the world so dangerous everywhere there is comfort and we have a lot of threats and we have a lot everywhere will school for walls we are never school for peace but we know that peace is that something coming from the sky pieces work hard work so how would I to know how to think that we can promote peace we can to promote multinationals to make reforms for example for militaries for WTO from the Security Council how to develop the dialogue with people will not agree and I think it's very important to know that for people who has known the war on this their country they know the war is often as you said a disaster so in this matter how we can have some developing a culture of peace such a very big point for everybody in the social society and so maybe together we can make peace do it again no we can talk about that for a very long time I think the previous issues the issues that happened in the previous years and the global affairs that you were talking about that has to do with the nature of the world being unipolar what seems that has happened after the collapse of the Soviet Union now the world is bouncing back and is becoming if if it hasn't become already multipolar and that unavoidably will bring us to understand me that there is a need to reinstate the meaning and significance of international law and universal institutions as the UN and by building from the UN Charter by using everything good that has happened that has been achieved through our previous decades building from trust to each other should be very careful and cautious about those elements of trust that we still have in place we have to learn to listen to hear each other to respect each other and to be prepared to find compromises based on that I believe that in the end it is unavoidable and the sooner we have that the better we're preparing for such a development of events mr. president you have one question before we suction but I cannot give the floor to I cannot help but give the forward to the laureate of thal de développement my colleague further did cabbage has received the award and it was well deserved so I would like to give him the floor in the end thank you very much mr. president you have been in this gallery discussion club for 15 years already that's a significant Europe and the lot has changed I wanted to ask you questions so against this backdrop of 15 years how has your perception of Russia has changed your own country as well as everything around it and against this backdrop how did your perception of yourself as a leader of Russia has changed I wanted to ask to try to avoid and not answer the second part of your question I believe that me giving evaluations of myself that that's inappropriate now as for Russia and my view my attitude I can say that my love towards country and I'm not afraid to use these lofty words my love has grown many fold to be honest I didn't know Russia so well of course I'm I'm a Russian my history my background is from Russia my forefathers had lived for 300 years in one village and they went to one church I can see that in the church documents it's very interesting for me I feel myself being a part of the country of the Russian nation however lofty that sounds I feel that still my previous life and work that mostly had to do with an international affairs you know for almost 20 years I've worked in information intelligence and I didn't know Russia as well as I have learned about it when I came to Moscow and when I started to work at the federal level when they became the president of the country and prime ministry I saw how deep and how powerful this country is what strong moral historical roots it has been I know I did not learn it from the books of two Great Patriotic War I did not learn that from from the books but I saw it firsthand I saw the power of the Russian nation and the nation being very wise in this regard and it's not an exaggeration my love for Russia has grown many folds for everything around Russia it was nothing peculiar here that has always been throughout the history of Russia usually we were treated northern West fine when Russia was going through hard times and we were we were sent communitarian aid and we're thankful for that - there is no irony here but as soon as this 8th as soon as Russia became a strong competitor in international affairs right away there were issues being created in the path of Russian development looking at the logic of relations in the global renate is quite understandable I guess you could understand that how is it to have a strong competitor it's better to move forward without any competitors without any rivalry but is detrimental to those who are being the first ones ahead of everyone hello so and I have said that before despite the fact that we see a lot of threats in the world the world is becoming more balanced multipolar world is taking shape and it's good both for Russia and for Russian partners around the world and I truly expect that we can overcome the hardships of today that we can build the dialers all our partners and participants international will be strengthening ourselves from inside and that will give us the opportunity to foster a fully-fledged relations with our partners and global affairs mr. president naturally Valda Club cannot compete with a wiseness of the Russian nation that you have learned first for many years we take upon ourselves to try to challenge you intellectually maybe we can do that selectively thank you very much for giving us so much for your time hope to see you in the year again and online we have I would like to thank all experts that are taking part in this works have been doing so for many years Russian and foreign experts and a special words of thanks go to my colleagues in high leadership of Russia it is they have an opportunity to to travel abroad and to show themselves to prove themselves but still they believe it's necessary to come out to Russia and to take part in our discussions for us it is very important and very significant because it gives us an opportunity to vocalize our position and to hear you as well it's important for us how you actually word your questions for us is also very important very interesting I wish you all the best thank you very much
