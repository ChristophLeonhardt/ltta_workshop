oh hello everyone how is everyone doing
it is mesh yourself there at the daily
shimon we are back for the very last
time to heavy rain Baelor oh my goodness
I'm so sad to believe in this game so
this is the last episode of a heavy rain
now this is the heavy rain chronicles
this was the only DLC that was released
for heavy rain and what it is is
basically a mission for Madison
where she is trying to investigate a
potential person to be the origami
killer so it takes place two years
before heavy rain
okay leizerman now this is very intense
it has multiple endings okay so I
haven't played it before so let us start
this shit Madison page but it's Sam I
got the information you asked for the
guy's name is Leland white used to be a
package of it I was right single
apparently out of work for last year no
criminal record no psychiatric history a
taxidermist
that's pretty original he got his
address I'd like to ask him a few
questions
last known address was for one one
Harbor Street Lexington you really think
this guy could be the origami killer
whew
so her voice has changed for some reason
I think this was made before heavy rain
was made I don't know okay so right now
we are going to a taxidermist house
which is a person who I think skins
animals I don't know I actually don't
know what I find out is to go and ask
him if it's not him he'll give me some
tips on how to stuff animate the other
killer and we've got the scoop of the
year did you're really not that's why
you
be careful master he never no no oh my
goodness I don't like her new voice guys
do you see the thing is what I think but
I'm not sure this is true but this was
the original voice actor of Madison but
then last minute they reavoice her
because they didn't like her which i
think that's what happens uh-uh
it could be guessing but yeah damn look
at these graphics though day November
3rd 4:15 p.m. I'm at the home of the
suspect
Leland Leland white the taxidermist or
shitty okay if you guys didn't know oh

a reporter Madison page fearless
investigation revealed the identity of
the dangerous serial killer who stuffs
his victims after killing them Leland

that the police are currently
investigating on my word that's bloody
scarier whoa okay lays open so that was
the deal see now obviously I'm not gonna

this thing so instead of making this
into like a mini series of two like
videos I'm just gonna do it all in one
so let us check out another ending oh
here we go
you've seen one of the possible
scenarios for the scene but it could
have worked out in several different
ways
okay the next ending we are going to go
for is in the middle of the horror and
this is Madison escapes without being
caught okay so we have to do a bit of a
sneaking around
okay leizerman so let's try and do that
okay let's go again baby
Leland white has just come home okay now
we know we need to not get caught and
leave without being noticed okay this is
probably a bit of a boring ending but it
is gonna be quite scary okay now we need
to be very careful all right to make
sure to hide in a room that is not gonna
check oh shit this is intense
