1
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:04,737
STRONG LEGAL AND CONSERVATIVE 

2
00:00:04,737 --> 00:00:05,271
BACKGROUNDS. 

3
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:05,905
THE PRESIDENT'S PICK IS 

4
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:07,607
EXPECTED TO FACE A CHALLENGING 

5
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:10,076
CONFIRMATION PROCESS IN THE 

6
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:10,309
SENATE. 

7
00:00:10,309 --> 00:00:11,244
REPUBLICANS CURRENTLY HOLD 51 

8
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:12,144
SEATS IN THE SENATE. 

9
00:00:12,144 --> 00:00:13,413
THEY'LL NEED ALL OF THOSE VOTES 

10
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:16,116
TO CONFIRM THE NOMINEE. 

11
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:19,252
GOP LEADERS ARE HOPING SOME 

12
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:22,722
DEMOCRATS WILL HELP THEM CLEAR 

13
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:23,889
THE 51 VOTE HURDLE. 

14
00:00:23,889 --> 00:00:25,658
TO DO THAT THEY'RE FOCUSING ON 

15
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:27,660
DEMOCRATS FROM RED STATES LIKE 

16
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,330
SENATOR JOE MANCHIN OF WEST 

17
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,131
VIRGINIA, SENATOR HEIDI 

18
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:32,631
HEITKAMP OF NORTH DAKOTA AND 

19
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:33,633
SENATOR JOE DONNELLY OF 

20
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:35,268
INDIANA, BUT THERE IS A CONCERN 

21
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:36,136
THAT SOME REPUBLICANS COULD 

22
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:37,937
BREAK FROM THE PARTY. 

23
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:39,906
SENATORS SUSAN COLLINS OF MAINE 

24
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:44,110
AND LISA MURKOWSKI OF ALASKA 

25
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,979
HAVE BOTH SAID THEIR VOTES WILL 

26
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,547
DEPEND ON THE NOMINEE'S STANCE 

27
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,715
ON WHETHER TO OVERTURN ROE 

28
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,115
VERSUS WADE. 

29
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:51,417

STRATEGIST JOEL PAYNE. 

41
00:01:11,837 --> 00:01:13,406
WELCOME TO YOU ALL. 

42
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,607
CAITLYN, LET ME START WITH YOU. 

43
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,209
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE FRONT 

44
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,911
RUNNERS AND THE PRESIDENT'S 

45
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,812
DECISION MAKING PROCESS UP TO 

46
00:01:19,812 --> 00:01:20,145
THIS POINT? 

47
00:01:20,145 --> 00:01:22,415
>> WELL, WE KNOW FROM VARIOUS 

48
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,416
REPORTS THAT THE PRESIDENT 

49
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:28,221
DIDN'T MAKE UP HIS MIND UNTIL 

50
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:28,454
TODAY. 

51
00:01:28,454 --> 00:01:29,222
YESTERDAY HE WAS TALKING ABOUT 

52
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:31,891
THAT HE HAD IT NARROWED DOWN TO 

53
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:32,625
ABOUT FOUR CANDIDATES, ALL OF 

54
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:35,295
WHOM HE SAID WOULD BE GREAT AND 

55
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:35,795
EASILY CONFIRMABLE. 

56
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:37,063
HE HAS CERTAINLY BEEN PLAYING 

57
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:40,266
THIS OUT AS A REALITY SHOWESQUE 

58
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,969
KIND OF ORDEAL AND REALLY KIND 

59
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,269
OF ENJOYING THIS WHOLE PROCESS. 

60
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:46,005
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT 

61
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:46,272
FOR HIM. 

62
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,306
HE HAS SAID AS MUCH. 

63
00:01:47,306 --> 00:01:49,242
HE SAYS THIS IS THE MOST 

64
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,510
IMPORTANT THING A PRESIDENT CAN 

65
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,012
DO ASIDE FROM WAR AND SOME 

66
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:53,345
OTHER ISSUES. 

67
00:01:53,345 --> 00:01:55,915
SO HE IS TAKING THIS 

68
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,517
OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY MAKE A 

69
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,118
THING OF IT AND HE ULTIMATELY 

70
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:01,221
HOPES THAT THIS IS SOMETHING 

71
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,223
THAT WILL BE REALLY CRITICAL IT 

72
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,258
HIS OWN LEGACY GIVEN THE AGES 

73
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:08,261
OF MANY OF THESE FOLKS YOU SEE 

74
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:08,860
ON THE SCREEN. 

75
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,763
THIS PERSON WILL LIKELY SERVE 

76
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:12,665
IN THIS POSITION FOR A 

77
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:12,965
GENERATION. 

78
00:02:12,965 --> 00:02:14,534
SO THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SEEING A 

79
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,703
LO OF ACTIVISM ON ALL SIDES OF 

80
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,304
THIS -- LOT OF ACTIVISM ON ALL 

81
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:21,841
SIDES OF THIS ISSUE AND A LOT 

82
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,042
OF LOBBYING AND JOCKEYING. 

83
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:27,313
WE'LL KNOW IN ABOUT A HALF HOUR 

84
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:27,546
OR SO. 

85
00:02:27,546 --> 00:02:28,615
>> SABRINA, REMIND US WHO SOME 

86
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,817
OF THE VOICES THAT HAVE 

87
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,719
INFLUENCED THE PRESIDENT WHEN 

88
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,487
IT COMES TO THIS PROCESS HAVE 

89
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:34,687
BEEN? 

90
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:37,457
WHO HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE KEY 

91
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:37,724
ADVISORS? 

92
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,659
>> HE'S CAST A WIDE NET. 

93
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,760
IT INCLUDES SOME OF THE AIDES 

94
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,928
AT THE WHITE HOUSE, SOME OF THE 

95
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:43,429
PEOPLE YOU WOULD EXPECT LIKE 

96
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:44,931
CHIEF OF STAFF JOHN KELLY AND 

97
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,666
STEVEN MILLER WHO IS A POLICY 

98
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,534
ADVISOR, BUT HE WAS GOLFING 

99
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:50,369
OVER THE WEEKEND WITH SEAN 

100
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:50,636
HANNITY. 

101
00:02:50,636 --> 00:02:52,538
HE HAS SOME OF THE PROMINENT 

102
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:53,906
CONSERVATIVES WHO OFF HAVE HIS 

103
00:02:53,906 --> 00:02:54,106
EAR. 

104
00:02:54,106 --> 00:02:55,808
THERE ARE SOME OF THE TRUMP 

105
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:57,510
LOYALISTS HE OFTEN SPEAKS TO AS 

106
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,011
WELL. 

107
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,245
HE'S ALSO CONSULTED WITH 

108
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,279
REPUBLICANS ON CAPITOL HILL. 

109
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:02,115
ULTIMATELY THEY WILL BE THE 

110
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:05,985
ONES WHO HOLD THE KEYS TO THE 

111
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:06,485
CONFIRMATION PROCESS. 

112
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:07,720
SO SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH 

113
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,022
MCCONNELL HAS HAD CONVERSATIONS 

114
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,256
WITH THE PRESIDENT AROUND THE 

115
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,725
NOMINATION AND HAS BEEN PART OF 

116
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:13,392
AT LEAST RECOMMENDING SOME OF 

117
00:03:13,392 --> 00:03:14,661
THE NAMES FROM THE SHORT LIST 

118
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,062
OR GIVING HIS OPINION ON 

119
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,665
WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD FACE 

120
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:20,266
A CONTENTIOUS CONFIRMATION 

121
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:20,599
BATTLE AHEAD. 

122
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,568
SOME, OF COURSE, ARE MORE 

123
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:23,303
CONTROVERSIAL THAN OTHERS. 

124
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,338
I THINK MOST INTERESTINGLY 

125
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:26,706
THERE IS THOMAS HARDIMAN WHO IS 

126
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,108
EMERGING AS ONE OF THE TWO 

127
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:29,475
FRONT RUNNERS. 

128
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:29,975
THAT'S SOMEONE WHO IS 

129
00:03:29,975 --> 00:03:31,411
RECOMMENDED BY PRESIDENT 

130
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,313
TRUMP'S OWN SISTER WHO SERVES 

131
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,079
IN FEDERAL COURT WITH HARDIMAN 

132
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,915
OR HAS SERVED WITH HIM. 

133
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:37,984
HE'S SOMEONE WHO DOES RELY ON 

134
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:38,284
HIS FAMILY. 

135
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,786
WHETHER OR NOT THAT HAS ANY 

136
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,254
BEARING ON THE PROCESS HERE 

137
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,522
REMAINS TO BE SEEN, BUT HE'S 

138
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:45,925
HAD A PRETTY INTERESTING MIX OF 

139
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:49,462
BOTH ESTABLISHMENT PICKS AS 

140
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,963
WELL AS RELIABLY CONSERVATIVE 

141
00:03:50,963 --> 00:03:53,066
JUSTICES OR JUDGES I SHOULD SAY 

142
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,667
WHO COULD, OF COURSE, BE PART 

143
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:55,535
OF CEMENTING THIS CONSERVATIVE 

144
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:58,004
LEANING SUPREME COURT FOR 

145
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,005
DECADES TO COME. 

146
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,441
>> LESLIE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE 

147
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,608
CONTENDERS IS THERE A MESSAGE 

148
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:04,310
ALREADY BEING SENT TO 

149
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,244
REPUBLICANS AS WE LOOK TO SEE 

150
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:07,213
WHO IT IS THE PRESIDENT WILL 

151
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:07,613
ULTIMATELY PICK? 

152
00:04:07,613 --> 00:04:09,782
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FOUR 

153
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,117
CANDIDATES WHO HAVE GOTTEN SO 

154
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,553
MUCH ATTENTION ALREADY BASED ON 

155
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:14,320
THEIR SORT OF JUDICIAL 

156
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:14,821
PHILOSOPHIES. 

157
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,555
WHAT IS IT REPUBLICANS ARE 

158
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:17,356
TAKING AWAY FROM THAT? 

159
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:18,658
>> THAT THEY WERE CORRECT TO 

160
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:21,861
VOTE FOR THE PRESIDENT IN 2016. 

161
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:22,962
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE WHEN IT 

162
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:23,329
COMES TO THEM. 

163
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,764
THE PRESIDENT IS DELIVERING ON 

164
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,766
A PROMISE THAT WAS CRITICAL TO 

165
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,967
ASSURING BASE REPUBLICANS 

166
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:28,300
TURNED OUT. 

167
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,837
HE ALREADY HAD THIS KIND OF NEW 

168
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,338
GROWING MOVEMENT OF 

169
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:32,838
CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRATS. 

170
00:04:32,838 --> 00:04:37,110
YOU HAD THE EVANGELIST, THE 

171
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,044
EVANGELICALS WHO WERE INVOLVED, 

172
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,345
BUT BASE REPUBLICANS WERE 

173
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:40,113
THINKING ABOUT SITTING ON THEIR 

174
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:40,947
HANDS AND THIS WAS THE 

175
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:41,814
AGREEMENT THAT WAS MADE. 

176
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:44,016
SO ANY OF THESE CANDIDATES ARE 

177
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:44,483
LOOKING VERY STRONG. 

178
00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:45,918
THERE'S AN INTERESTING THING I 

179
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,888
KEEP LOOKING AT WITH HARDIMAN 

180
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:51,758
IS HE DID SOME PRO BONO WORK 

181
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,059
FOR A SPANISH SPEAKING LEGAL 

182
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,261
SUPPORT EFFORT FOR POLITICAL 

183
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:55,494
ASYLUM. 

184
00:04:55,494 --> 00:04:55,961
>> HE SPEAK SPANISH. 

185
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:58,331
>> AND HE SPEAKS SPANISH AND HE 

186
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,666
THOUGHT IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST 

187
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,267
COMPELLING THINGS OF HIS ENTIRE 

188
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:01,667
CAREER. 

189
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:02,769
SO IT WILL BE INTERESTING AS 

190
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,138
THEY NOW IN LIGHT OF ALL OF THE 

191
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,006
ASYLUM ISSUES AND MOSTLY HE HAS 

192
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:08,541
TENDED TO SIDE WITH THE STATE, 

193
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,976
BUT THAT WILL BE ONE OF THE 

194
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,145
NUANCES I THINK THAT GIVES HIM 

195
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:12,945
A COMPASSIONATE HEART WHICH I 

196
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:15,815
THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL BE 

197
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,215
LOOKING FOR. 

198
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:17,884
>> LESLIE, WHEN YOU CONSIDER 

199
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:18,618
THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS AND 

200
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,620
WHAT IS EXPECTED TO BE A TOUGH 

201
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,221
CONFIRMATION FIGHT, WHAT DO YOU 

202
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:25,591
THINK REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS WILL 

203
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:27,460
HOPE FOR IN A NOMINEE? 

204
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,896
>> THEY'LL LOOK AT HOW DOES HE 

205
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:30,463
INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION? 

206
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,864
DOES HE BELIEVE IT'S A LIVE, 

207
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,166
LIVING DOCUMENT OR IS HE GOING 

208
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,768
TO BE MORE KIND OF TRADITIONAL 

209
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:36,636
IN HIS APPROACH? 

210
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,004
DID HE FOLLOW PRECEDENTS? 

211
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,940
YOU HAVE SOME OF THESE JURISTS 

212
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,508
PUSHING BACK ON LABELS IN TERMS 

213
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,210
OF HOW THEY SEE THEMSELVES AND 

214
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,244
INTERPRET THESE THINGS. 

215
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:46,245
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO 

216
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:48,815
BE PUT IN A LABEL OR IN A BOX. 

217
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,817
THAT MAKES THE SENATE VERY 

218
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,952
NERVOUS WHEN THIS HAPPENS, BUT 

219
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:54,086
I THINK THERE'S ENOUGH 

220
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:55,822
PRECEDENCE HERE THAT YOU CAN 

221
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,757
LOOK AT THEIR DECISIONS AND HOW 

222
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,560
THEY THINK TO MAKE A CRITICAL 

223
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,127
AND ACCURATE OBSERVATION. 

224
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,561
>> JOEL, WHAT ABOUT DEMOCRATS? 

225
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:06,866
IS THERE ANY IN SENT  -- 

226
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,067
INCENTIVE AT ALL FOR DEMOCRATS 

227
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,969
TO SUPPORT A NOMINEE OR IS THIS 

228
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,938
AN INSTANCE WHERE DEMOCRATS 

229
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,006
WILL OPPOSE WHOMEVER IT IS THAT 

230
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:14,874
THE PRESIDENT CHOOSES? 

231
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,209
>> IT DEPENDS WHO YOU ARE. 

232
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,910
IF YOU'RE HEIDI HEITKAMP OR JOE 

233
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,046
MANCHIN OR JOE DONNELLY, YOU DO 

234
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:24,951
HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO AT LEAST 

235
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,018
LISTEN TO WHO THE PRESIDENT 

236
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,153
NOMINATES AND FIGURE OUT 

237
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,455
WHETHER YOUR FOLKS BACK AT HOME 

238
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,656
WILL EITHER ALLOW YOU TO 

239
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,358
QUESTION OR PUSH BAG ON THE 

240
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:33,459
PRESIDENT'S NOMINEE OR WHETHER 

241
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,660
YOU'LL BE COMPELLED TO SUPPORT 

242
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,062
THIS NOMINEE EVEN IF THE 

243
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,363
DEMOCRATIC BASE IS AFTER YOU. 

244
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,165
IF YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT LIKE 

245
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,300
DIANNE FEINSTEIN WHO WAS 

246
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,034
ESSENTIALLY PRIMARIED IN 

247
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,569
CALIFORNIA, YOU HAVE ALL THE 

248
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,937
PRESSURE COMING FROM THE OTHER 

249
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,607
END OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TELLING 

250
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:48,340
YOU DO NOT ENGAGE. 

251
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,243
THIS IS A STOLEN SEAT. 

252
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,980
THIS IS A SEAT ILL BEGOTTEN BY 

253
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,548
REPUBLICANS THAT MITCH 

254
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:59,252
McCONNELL FAMOUSLY STALLED FROM 

255
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,220
MERRICK GARLAND AND YOU HAVE 

256
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,689
EVERY REASON NOT TO COOPERATE 

257
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:04,790
WITH WHOEVER PRESIDENT TRUMP 

258
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,090
NOMINATES. 

259
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,025
SENATOR BOB CASEY OF 

260
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,460
PENNSYLVANIA CAME OUT ALREADY 

261
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,029
AND SAID HE DID NOT SUPPORT THE 

262
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,165
NOMINEE JUST OFF THE TOP AND I 

263
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:12,865
ACTUALLY THINK STRATEGICALLY 

264
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,500
THAT'S VERY SMART BECAUSE THAT 

265
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,568
TAKES HIM OFF THE GRIDDLE 

266
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,002
WHOEVER THE NOMINEE IS, RIGHT? 

267
00:07:17,002 --> 00:07:21,340
YOU COULD BE BOXED IN IF IT'S 

268
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,742
SOMEBODY WHO REPRESENTS -- 

269
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,011
HARDIMAN, I BELIEVE, IS FROM 

270
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:25,544
PENNSYLVANIA, I BELIEVE. 

271
00:07:25,544 --> 00:07:27,847
SO THAT KIND OF CREATED SOME 

272
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:28,948
DIFFICULT HOMESTATE POLITICS 

273
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:29,215
FOR HIM. 

274
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,850
HE WENT AHEAD AND TOOK THAT 

275
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,619
ISSUE OFF THE TABLE. 

276
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,353
I THINK IT DEPENDS WHO YOU ARE 

277
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:39,458
IN THAT DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS. 

278
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,660
>> SABRINA, WHAT'S THE 

279
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,261
POLITICAL REALITY FOR 

280
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:42,561
DEMOCRATS? 

281
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:44,964
IS THERE ANYTHING DEMOCRATS CAN 

282
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:50,036
DO REALISTICALLY TO STOP OR  

283
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:50,870
BLOCK A NOMINATION? 

284
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,338
>> I THINK THERE AREN'T A LOT 

285
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:55,241
OF TOOLS HERE BECAUSE THEY ARE 

286
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,508
ULTIMATELY IN THE MINORITY AND 

287
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:57,743
REPUBLICANS CAN CONFIRM A 

288
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,145
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE WITH A 

289
00:07:59,145 --> 00:07:59,745
SIMPLE MAJORITY VOTE. 

290
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,347
THE KEY FOR DEMOCRATS IS TO 

291
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,616
APPLY A GREAT DEAL OF PRESSURE 

292
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,818
NOT JUST ON THOSE VULNERABLE 

293
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:06,652
DEMOCRATS WITHIN THEIR OWN 

294
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,354
CAUCUS, BUT ON THE SWING VOTES 

295
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:10,957
WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS AS 

296
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:11,190
WELL. 

297
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,925
SUSAN COLLINS AND LISA 

298
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:15,161
MURKOWSKI, SOME OF THE SENATORS 

299
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:15,994
WHO EXPRESSED SOME RESERVATIONS 

300
00:08:15,994 --> 00:08:17,964
ABOUT ROE V. WADE, FOR EXAMPLE, 

301
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,199
AND DEMOCRATS WILL HAVE TO MAKE 

302
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,567
THIS NOMINEE SO OBJECTIONABLE 

303
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:22,468
THAT REPUBLICANS ARE UNABLE TO 

304
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,437
HOLD THE LINE AND PERHAPS THEY 

305
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,539
COULD AT BEST SINK THE 

306
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:27,039
PRESIDENT'S NOMINEE. 

307
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,442
IT'S GOING TO BE, OF COURSE, AN 

308
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,043
UPHILL BATTLE, BUT BECAUSE IT'S 

309
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,845
A MIDTERM ELECTION YEAR THEY DO 

310
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:33,879
FEEL THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE 

311
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:35,246
CONFIRMATION FATE FOR NEIL 

312
00:08:35,246 --> 00:08:36,482
GORSUCH WHO ULTIMATELY 

313
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:37,582
REAFFIRMED THE BALANCE OF THE 

314
00:08:37,582 --> 00:08:37,816
COURT. 

315
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:41,087
OF COURSE, HE WAS REPLACING THE 

316
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:41,720
LATE ANTONIN SCALIA. 

317
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,988
THIS IS SOMEONE WHO WILL 

318
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:44,624
DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THE SUPREME 

319
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,425
COURT FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS TO 

320
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:46,625
COME. 

321
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:47,393
I THINK THAT'S THE MESSAGE 

322
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:48,493
YOU'LL HEAR MORE FROM DEMOCRATS 

323
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:50,830
AND YOU'LL SEE THEM DRIVING 

324
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,232
HOME ON ISSUES LIKE ACCESS TO 

325
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:53,933
ABORTION, IMMIGRATION, 

326
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:54,233
HEALTHCARE. 

327
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,002
IT WAS INTERESTING JOE MANCHIN, 

328
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,536
ONE OF THOSE VULNERABLE 

329
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:59,005
DEMOCRATS WHO WAS INVITED TO 

330
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,706
THE WHITE HOUSE, HE POINTED TO 

331
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,206
COVERAGE OF PREEXISTING 

332
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:02,575
CONDITIONS AS SOMETHING HE'S 

333
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,577
GOING TO ASK ABOUT WHICH WAS 

334
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:05,911
ALLUDING TO THE IMPORTANCE OF 

335
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:07,379
OBAMACARE AND THAT THIS JUSTICE 

336
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:09,982
WOULD PERHAPS BE MORE WILLING 

337
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,117
TO UPHOLD PRESIDENT OBAMA'S 

338
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:11,484
HEALTHCARE LAW. 

339
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,519
A LOT OF IT WILL BE MORE 

340
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,921
CAMPAIGN ISSUES THAN TOOLS AND 

341
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,088
TACTICS IN THE SENATE. 

342
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:17,790
>> JOEL, LET ME ASK YOU WHAT DO 

343
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,526
YOU DO IF YOU ARE A JOE 

344
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,027
MANCHIN, HEIDI HEITKAMP, JOE 

345
00:09:22,027 --> 00:09:22,428
DONNELLY? 

346
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,830
WHAT'S THE BEST STRATEGY FOR 

347
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,365
DEMOCRATS IN THE RED STATES? 

348
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,033
>> WELL, I THINK YOU WAIT. 

349
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:29,635
I THINK YOU WAIT TO SEE WHAT'S 

350
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:32,304
GOING TO HAPPEN WITH SUSAN 

351
00:09:32,304 --> 00:09:33,706
COLLINS OR LISA MURKOWSKI 

352
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:34,807
BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY IF THOSE 

353
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:37,276
TWO REPUBLICAN SENATORS DON'T 

354
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:37,843
CROSS OVER, REPUBLICANS CAN 

355
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:43,716
JUST HOLD THE LINE AND EVEN IF 

356
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:44,850
DEMOCRATS HOLD SERVE, 

357
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,885
REPUBLICANS CAN GET THIS 

358
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,186
NOMINEE THROUGH, BUT IF YOU 

359
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:48,888
HAVE DEFLECTIONS LIKE THAT FROM 

360
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:49,889
THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS, IT DOES 

361
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,590
CREATE A BIT OF CRISIS FOR SOME 

362
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,292
OF THOSE FOLK WE'RE TALKING 

363
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,428
ABOUT, THE JOE MANCHINS, JOE 

364
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,229
DONNELLYS AND HEIDI HEITKAMPS 

365
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:57,596
OF THE WORLD. 

366
00:09:57,596 --> 00:09:58,797
SO I THINK YOU WAIT AND SEE 

367
00:09:58,797 --> 00:10:01,534
WHAT SOME OF THE RESPONSE IS 

368
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,303
FROM THE REPUBLICAN SIDE AND I 

369
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:08,174
THINK YOU MAKE A DECISION BASED 

370
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:08,441
ON THAT. 

371
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,609
I NOTICED WHAT SABRINA NOTICED 

372
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:10,876
AS WELL. 

373
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,812
DEMOCRATS ARE MAKING THIS ABOUT 

374
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:13,112
HEALTHCARE. 

375
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:13,979
THEY'RE ALSO MAKING THE FRAMING 

376
00:10:13,979 --> 00:10:16,048
HERE ABOUT BIG CORPORATIONS 

377
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,015
VERSUS WORKING CLASS PEOPLE. 

378
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:19,685
WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON? 

379
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:20,486
SO THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY TRYING 

380
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:23,189
TO TURN THIS INTO AN ELECTION 

381
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:23,789
DAY ISSUE FOR NOVEMBER. 

382
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,424
>> LESLIE, LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT 

383
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:28,160
WHAT WE EXPECT WILL BE A TOUGH 

384
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,594
CONFIRMATION FIGHT. 

385
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:29,729
DOES THAT ACTUALLY ULTIMATELY 

386
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:32,030
HELP REPUBLICANS IN THE 

387
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,297
MIDTERMS? 

388
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:33,632
>> IT DEPENDS WHO THEY'RE 

389
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:33,932
FIGHTING. 

390
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:36,235
ARE THEY FIGHTING REPUBLICANS 

391
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:37,703
WITHIN THE CONSERVATIVES OR 

392
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,171
BATTLING AGAINST EACH OTHER. 

393
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:40,406
WE LIKE TO KILL OUR OWN. 

394
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:41,907
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HELP 

395
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:42,173
ANYBODY. 

396
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:43,809
I DON'T THINK YOU'LL SEE THAT. 

397
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,978
THE BENEFIT OF THIS IS YOU HAVE 

398
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,714
KIND OF A CONSENSUS 

399
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,716
CONSERVATIVE JURISTS THAT 

400
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:51,317
PEOPLE CAN FUNDAMENTALLY GET 

401
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,252
BEHIND EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW 

402
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:54,185
IT'S NOT PERFECT. 

403
00:10:54,185 --> 00:10:55,421
IT'S LIKE AN UMBRELLA. 

404
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,356
IT DOES GIVE YOU COVER FOR MOST 

405
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:57,757
THINGS. 

406
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:58,724
PEOPLE CAN ACCEPT THAT. 

407
00:10:58,724 --> 00:10:59,324
WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT ALL 

408
00:10:59,324 --> 00:11:00,459
THAT IS THE DEMOCRATS ARE 

409
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,062
TRYING TO MAKE THIS AN ISSUE ON 

410
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,630
ABORTION AND ROE V. WADE. 

411
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,564
SOMEBODY LIKE HARDIMAN DOESN'T 

412
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:06,632
HAVE A STRONG POSITION. 

413
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:09,034
IF THE PRESIDENT CAN NEUTRALIZE 

414
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:10,336
THAT WITH McCONNELL AND GIVE 

415
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,504
SOME ASSURANCE THAT THAT'S NOT 

416
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,938
WHAT THIS IS GOING TO BE ABOUT. 

417
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:15,508
IT'S NOT ABOUT CHANGING 

418
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,108
PRECEDENCE ON THIS. 

419
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,110
I DO BELIEVE IT'S VERY 

420
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,311
IMPACTFUL IN NEUTRALIZING THE 

421
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,113
DEMOCRATIC ARGUMENT ACROSS THE 

422
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:21,346
BOARD. 

423
00:11:21,346 --> 00:11:22,515
>> CAITLYN, HOW INTENSE DO YOU 

424
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,515
THINK THAT PRESSURE WILL BE 

425
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:29,522
GOING BACK TO THE DEMOCRATS A 

426
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:29,755
MOMENT? 

427
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:32,358
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THEM DECLINE 

428
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,626
THE WHITE HOUSE'S INVITATION 

429
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:34,860
FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT TONIGHT, 

430
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,462
ALL THREE OF THE DEMOCRATS 

431
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,563
WE'VE JUST BEEN TALKING ABOUT. 

432
00:11:38,563 --> 00:11:39,832
HOW MUCH POLITICAL PRESSURE DO 

433
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:41,066
YOU THINK THOSE DEMOCRATS IN 

434
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:43,235
RED STATES WILL BE FACING? 

435
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,136
>> IT'S GOING TO BE VERY 

436
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:44,403
INTENSE. 

437
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:45,905
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THEIR 

438
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:46,806
REPUBLICAN CHALLENGERS MAKING 

439
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,875
THIS AN ISSUE IN THEIR 

440
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,175
CAMPAIGNS. 

441
00:11:50,175 --> 00:11:53,345
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT INDIANA, 

442
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:54,746
WEST VIRGINIA AND NORTH DAKOTA. 

443
00:11:54,746 --> 00:11:56,715
THOSE ARE WHERE DEMOCRATS ARE 

444
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,317
UP FOR REELECTION IN STATE 

445
00:11:58,317 --> 00:11:59,285
TRUMP WON OVERWHELMINGLY AND 

446
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:00,619
THOSE ARE ALSO DEMOCRATS THAT 

447
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:01,987
DID CROSS THE AISLE LAST TIME 

448
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,522
AND VOTE FOR GORSUCH. 

449
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:04,290
THE DIFFERENCE, THOUGH, IS 

450
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,391
BECAUSE AS WE'VE BEEN TALKING 

451
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,727
ABOUT, THIS IS A SEAT THAT 

452
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:09,929
COULD POTENTIALLY CHANGE THE 

453
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,465
BALANCE OF POWER OR THE 

454
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:13,165
IDEOLOGICAL MAKEUP OF THE 

455
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:13,398
COURT. 

456
00:12:13,398 --> 00:12:15,835
SO THIS IS A MUCH MORE 

457
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,236
DIFFICULT DECISION FOR THESE 

458
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,905
LAWMAKERS TO MAKE AND DEMOCRATS 

459
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,007
REALLY HAVE TO KIND OF WEIGH 

460
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:22,608
TWO THINGS HERE. 

461
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:24,910
ONE IS THE IDEA THAT THE 

462
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,114
DEMOCRATIC BASE IS SO ENERGIZED 

463
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:31,617
BY BEING AGAINST ANYTHING THAT 

464
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,919
TRUMP IS FOR, BUT ALSO REALLY 

465
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,921
ENERGIZED ON KEY ISSUES LIKE 

466
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,256
HEALTHCARE, ACCESS TO ABORTION, 

467
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,023
VOTING RIGHTS, SOME OTHER 

468
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,658
THINGS THAT ARE REALLY 

469
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:40,926
ANIMATING THAT BASE, BALANCED 

470
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:44,830
WITH THE IDEA THAT AS A RED 

471
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,731
STATE DEMOCRAT, PARTICULARLY IN 

472
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,633
A STATE THAT TRUMP WON 

473
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:48,166
OVERWHELMINGLY, YOU DON'T 

474
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,901
REALLY HAVE THE LUXURY OF 

475
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:51,403
DEPENDING JUST ON THAT 

476
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:51,803
DEMOCRATIC BASE. 

477
00:12:51,803 --> 00:12:53,005
YOU HAVE TO GET SOME 

478
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,406
REPUBLICANS AND, OF COURSE, YOU 

479
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:55,941
HAVE TO GET THOSE INDEPENDENTS. 

480
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:56,909
SO IF YOU HAVE THE REPUBLICANS 

481
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,911
ON THE OTHER SIDE MAKING THIS 

482
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,613
AN ISSUE AND PUTTING MONEY 

483
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,114
BEHIND MAKING THIS AN ISSUE IN 

484
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,016
CAMPAIGNS, I THINK IT MAKES IT 

485
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:04,383
VERY DIFFICULT. 

486
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,819
YOU ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE 

487
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:07,086
TIMELINE. 

488
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,821
A VOTE HAPPENING IN SEPTEMBER 

489
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,522
OR OCTOBER, WE KNOW THIS NEWS 

490
00:13:10,522 --> 00:13:11,457
CYCLE MOVES VERY FAST. 

491
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,559
WE COULD BE ON TO OTHER ISSUES 

492
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,160
COME NOVEMBER, BUT IT DOES 

493
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,162
PLACE THAT CRITICAL VOTE IN THE 

494
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:17,863
SPOTLIGHT WHICH UPS THE ANTE 

495
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:20,132
FOR A LOT OF DEMOCRATS. 

496
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,334
>> SABRINA, IF YOU COULD JUST 

497
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:23,636
UNDERSCORE FOR US HOW DIFFERENT 

498
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:30,109
IS THIS PARTICULAR PICK FROM 

499
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:30,876
NEIL GORSUCH'S PICK? 

500
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,711
>> IT'S DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT 

501
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:34,680
AS CAITLYN SAID AND WE'VE 

502
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,047
TALKED ABOUT. 

503
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,215
THIS IS NOT SOMEONE REAFFIRMING 

504
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,517
THE BALANCE OF THE COURT AS IT 

505
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:39,151
CURRENTLY EXISTS. 

506
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,253
YOU ARE LOSING ANTHONY KENNEDY 

507
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:42,721
WHO HAS BEEN A PIVOTAL SWING 

508
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:45,891
VOTE ON ISSUES THAT INCLUDE 

509
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,226
ACCESS TO ABORTION, LGBT 

510
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:47,459
RIGHTS. 

511
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,161
I THINK CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN 

512
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,863
ROBERTS HAS SOMETIMES ANGERED 

513
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,431
CONSERVATIVES, MOST INFAMOUSLY 

514
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,033
WHEN HE VOTED TO UPHOLD THE 

515
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,234
HEART OF OBAMACARE, BUT FOR THE 

516
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:59,271
MOST PART I THINK WHAT YOU WILL 

517
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:02,207
SEE IS A DECIDEDLY CONSERVATIVE 

518
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:03,042
BALANCE WITHIN THE SUPREME 

519
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,310
COURT AND THAT'S WHY DEMOCRATS 

520
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,211
DO BELIEVE THEY DO PERHAPS HAVE 

521
00:14:06,211 --> 00:14:07,212
MORE PER SWAYING AT LEAST IN 

522
00:14:07,212 --> 00:14:09,114
THE EYES OF THE PUBLIC WHEN -- 

523
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,416
PERSUASION AT LEAST IN THE EYES 

524
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,517
OF THE PUBLIC WHEN IT COMES TO 

525
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,218
THE BATTLE THAT IS MOVING AHEAD 

526
00:14:13,218 --> 00:14:14,420
BECAUSE THEY COULD ELEVATE SOME 

527
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,121
OF THESE ISSUES AND MAKE THIS A 

528
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:17,455
LOT MORE ABOUT A DECISIVE 

529
00:14:17,455 --> 00:14:19,058
QUESTION AS TO WHAT THE FUTURE 

530
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,759
OF AMERICA WILL LOOK LIKE ON 

531
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,062
ISSUES THAT ALSO INCLUDE 

532
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:23,629
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, VOTING 

533
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:23,862
RIGHTS. 

534
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:25,664
THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF ISSUES 

535
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:28,067
THAT ARE BEFORE THE COURT, THE 

536
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,735
TRAVEL BAN MOST RECENTLY BEING 

537
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:30,569
ANOTHER BIG RULING WHERE YOU 

538
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,538
SAW THE IMPACT OF ANTHONY 

539
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,539
KENNEDY STILL BEING THERE, BUT 

540
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,341
YOU STILL SAW THE IMPACT OF 

541
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,209
WHAT COULD BE, OF COURSE, A 

542
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,510
FUTURE COURT LOOKING AT A 

543
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,546
SIMILAR CASE AND PERHAPS HAVING 

544
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,614
MORE FAR REACHING CONSEQUENCES. 

545
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,382
SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS 

546
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:43,615
ABOUT. 

547
00:14:43,615 --> 00:14:45,117
>> LESLIE, WE KNOW ONCE THE 

548
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,652
PICK IS ANNOUNCED THAT FORMER 

549
00:14:47,652 --> 00:14:50,956
ARIZONA SENATOR JON KYL WILL BE 

550
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:51,557
THE "SHERPA" WHO ESSENTIALL 

551
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,158
GUIDES THE NOMINEE THROUGH THAT 

552
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,426
PROCESS AND BASICALLY GOES 

553
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:55,961
THROUGH THE MEETINGS ON CAPITOL 

554
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,463
HILL, HELPS THEM THROUGH THAT 

555
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:57,730
PROCESS. 

556
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,065
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE STRATEGY 

557
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:00,966
WAS IN CHOOSING JON KYL? 

558
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:02,468
>> IT'S SOMEBODY WHO OBVIOUSLY 

559
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,036
HAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF 

560
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:09,608
EXPERIENCE ON THE SENATE 

561
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:12,811
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, HAVING 

562
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:16,315
SEEN IT AND UNDERSTANDS THE 

563
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,983
ATTEMPTS, KNOWS THE STAFF AND 

564
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:19,485
WHERE THE PITFALLS ARE. 

565
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,120
ALSO ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES IS 

566
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,588
GOING TO BE RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS. 

567
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,189
THAT COMES UP CONSISTENTLY. 

568
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:25,658
IT'S COME UP NOW AND HOW THAT 

569
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:29,161
IS GOING TO BE AN ISSUE THAT 

570
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,864
GALVANIZES THE BASE, BUT IT'S 

571
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,565
UNDERSTANDING THE POINTS OF ALL 

572
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:34,466
THOSE MEMBERS, WHAT'S GOING TO 

573
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,468
BE IMPORTANT TO THEM AND THAT'S 

574
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:37,168
BASICALLY GETTING THAT NOMINEE 

575
00:15:37,168 --> 00:15:39,838
UP TO SPEED EXTREMELY QUICKLY 

576
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:41,740
WITH THE CLIP NOTES, SO TO 

577
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,143
SPEAK, HOW TO EXCEL AND SUCCEED 

578
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,210
WITH EACH INDIVIDUAL SENATOR. 

579
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,447
>> AS YOU'VE BEEN SPEAKING, 

580
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,148
LESLIE, WE'VE BEEN WATCHING 

581
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,081
OUTSIDE THE SUPREME COURT. 

582
00:15:50,081 --> 00:15:52,117
THERE YOU SEE PROTESTERS 

583
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:52,484
DEMONSTRATING. 

584
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:56,354
I'M READING THE SIGNS THERE. 

585
00:15:56,354 --> 00:15:57,589
DON'T CRIMINALIZE ABORTION SOME 

586
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:59,057
OF THOSE SIGNS SAY. 

587
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:01,660
WE THE PEOPLE, I SEE SIGNS FOR 

588
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,127
REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM. 

589
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,964
SO WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO 

590
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:06,397
MONITOR OBVIOUSLY. 

591
00:16:06,397 --> 00:16:07,866

PROTECT ROE. 

593
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:09,268
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO 

594
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:10,669
MONITOR WHAT IS TAKING PLACE 

595
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,539

OR SO WE'RE EXPECTING THAT TO 

599
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:20,045
TAKE PLACE.

AS IF IT MAY BE JUDGE 

630

PRESIDENT WHO HAS MANAGED TODAY 

632
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:25,577

INSIDE THE EAST ROOM WHERE

00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:48,434
PEOPLE ARE GATHERING NOW AS WE 

647
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,035
AWAIT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS

ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS PICK FOR

SUPREME COURT NOMINEE. 

650
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:57,576
ED, LET ME ASK YOU WHEN IT 

651
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,078
COMES TO LAWMAKERS ON CAPITAL 

652
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,648
HIM, AS YOU LOOK AT THOSE FOUR 

653
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:03,515
CONTENDERS, IS THERE A SENSE 

654
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:04,583
AMONG REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS IN 

655
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,984
PARTICULAR THEY'VE ALREADY 

656
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:06,618
SECURED A VICTORY HERE? 

657
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:07,252
>> Reporter:  NO. 

658
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,488
BECAUSE THERE IS CONCERN ABOUT 

659
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,689
THE POSSIBILITY THAT ONE, TWO, 

660
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:13,992
MAYBE AS MANY AS THREE 

661
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,227
REPUBLICAN SENATORS WOULD HAVE 

662
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,129
SOME CONCERN WITH WHOEVER IT IS 

663
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:17,596
THE PRESIDENT PICKS. 

664
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,031
A LOT OF THE FOCUS RIGHT NOW, 

665
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:21,133
OF COURSE, IS ON SUSAN COLLINS 

666
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,368
OF MAINE, LISA MURKOWSKI OF 

667
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:24,503
ALASKA, JOHN McCAIN OF ARIZONA 

668
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:25,904
SHOULD HE BE ABLE TO COME TO 

669
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:28,307
WASHINGTON AND VOTE, BUT THERE 

670
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,475
COULD BE SOME OTHER UNFORESEEN 

671
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:30,809
ISSUE OR CIRCUMSTANCE THAT 

672
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:33,479
MIGHT COMPEL ANOTHER REPUBLICAN 

673
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,180
SENATOR POTENTIALLY TO OPPOSE 

674
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:35,480
THE PICK. 

675
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,583
OTHERWISE AS MANY DEMOCRATS 

676
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:41,286
HAVE POINTED OUT, IT'S 

677
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,989
ESSENTIALLY THE REPUBLICANS 

678
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:45,858
GAME OR NOMINATION TO LOSE 

679
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,025
BECAUSE DEMOCRATS ARE 

680
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:47,826
COMPLETELY HAMSTRUNG UNABLE TO 

681
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:49,428
DO ANYTHING REALLY TO STOP THIS 

682
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,529
FROM HAPPENING OTHER THAN TO 

683
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,531
PUT PRESSURE ON AT LEAST ONE 

684
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:53,932
REPUBLICAN, MAYBE TWO FOR 

685
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,601
WHATEVER REASON TO VOTE NO. 

686
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:59,838
>> ED, WHAT KIND OF REACTION 

687
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:04,509
WILL YOU EXPECT TO SATISFACTORY 

688
00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:06,578
-- TO SEE FROM LAWMAKERS ON 

689
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,448
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE ONCE 

690
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,082
THE ANNOUNCEMENT IS ANNOUNCED? 

691
00:19:11,082 --> 00:19:12,951
>> Reporter:  ONE OF THE THINGS 

692
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:13,986
THAT'S EXPECTED WHEN THE WHITE 

693
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,088
HOUSE UNVEILS THE NOMINEE IS 

694
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,922
THEY HAVE INVITED A HANDFUL OF 

695
00:19:17,922 --> 00:19:19,224
WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE ONLY 

696
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:20,726
REPUBLICAN SENATORS TO BE IN 

697
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,894
THE EAST ROOM TONIGHT FOR THE 

698
00:19:22,894 --> 00:19:23,228
ANNOUNCEMENT. 

699
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:24,429
THE GENIUS IN THAT FROM A 

700
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:25,330
COMMUNICATIONS PERSPECTIVE IS 

701
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,233
THAT THEY WILL THEN RUN TO THE 

702
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:29,434
CAMERAS IN THE ROOM AND START 

703
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:32,304
TO IMMEDIATELY SORT OF CONVEY 

704
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:33,805
WHY THEY THINK THIS PERSON IS A 

705
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:35,807
BRILLIANT PICK AND WHY IT'S 

706
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,209
SOMEONE THE SENATE SHOULD 

707
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,278
QUICKLY CONFIRM AND PUT ON THE 

708
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:39,511
COURT. 

709
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,380
THAT'S SORT OF A NEWER WAY OF 

710
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,915
DOING THIS AND WE'RE GOING TO 

711
00:19:43,915 --> 00:19:48,086
SEE THIS NOMINEE WE'RE TOLD 

712
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,187
TOMORROW AT THE CAPITAL 

713
00:19:49,187 --> 00:19:53,158
BEGINNING TO MAKE THEIR ROUNDS 

714
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:54,926
TO MEET WITH SENATE MAJORITY 

715
00:19:54,926 --> 00:19:57,529
MAJORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL 

716
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:01,332
-- SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH 

717
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:01,632
McCONNELL. 

718
00:20:01,632 --> 00:20:02,734
THE AVERAGE CONFIRMATION LENGTH 

719
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:03,335
IS 107 DAYS. 

720
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,736
THAT IS A TIMELINE THEY HOPE 

721
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:07,472
THEY CAN FULFILL IN THIS CASE 

722
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,308
IN GETTING THE NEW JUSTICE ON 

723
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,243
THE BENCH BY THE FIRST MONDAY 

724
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,078
IN OCTOBER WHEN THE SUPREME 

725
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:13,778
COURT RECONVENES. 

726
00:20:13,778 --> 00:20:17,983
>> WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW 

727
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:18,984
OBVIOUSLY THE DYNAMIC IS 

728
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,386
DIFFERENT COMPARED TO WHEN NEIL 

729
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,087
GORSUCH WAS CHOSEN CONSIDERING 

730
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:23,388
AS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 

731
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,958
HERE IN NEW YORK THIS PICK IS 

732
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,659
EXPECTED TO MOVE THE COURT MORE 

733
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:28,760
SOLIDLY TO THE RIGHT. 

734
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,763
I WONDER IF THAT'S SORT OF A 

735
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,131
PALPABLE FEELING THAT YOU'RE 

736
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:36,134
SENSING AS WELL IN WASHINGTON 

737
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:37,736
BECAUSE THOSE STAKES ARE HIGHER 

738
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,005
SOME HAVE ARGUED WITH THIS 

739
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:40,438
SUPREME COURT PICK. 

740
00:20:40,438 --> 00:20:41,406
>> Reporter:  SURE. 

741
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:45,110
THAT IS THE WAY PEOPLE READ IT 

742
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,478
HERE IF THE PRESIDENT IS INDEED 

743
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,179
WORKING OFF THIS LIST OF FOUR 

744
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:49,481
JUSTICES THAT HAS BEEN TALKED 

745
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:50,615
ABOUT NOW FOR THREE DAYS 

746
00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:52,985
BECAUSE ALL OF THEM ESSENTIALLY 

747
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,786
HAVE A RECORD THAT SUGGESTS 

748
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:55,988
THEY ARE CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES 

749
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:59,224
IN THE MOLD OF ANTONIN SCALIA 

750
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,426
OR NEIL GORSUCH OR SAMUEL ALITO 

751
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,627
AND THAT THERE AREN'T ANY 

752
00:21:02,627 --> 00:21:04,029
SURPRISES NECESSARILY OR 

753
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,031
REASONS TO DOUBT THAT THEY 

754
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:09,134
WOULD RULE IN FAVOR OF THE 

755
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:09,768
CONSERVATIVE LEGAL VIEWPOINTS. 

756
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:17,776
SO THAT IS WHAT SORT OF FEEDS 

757
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:18,610
THIS INEVITABILITY FOR 

758
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,179
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS AND 

759
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:21,846
LIBERALS CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT 

760
00:21:21,846 --> 00:21:23,114
COULD TRANSPIRE IN THE COMING 

761
00:21:23,114 --> 00:21:24,383
YEARS SHOULD THIS PERSON GET ON 

762
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,750
THE BENCH AND IT PERHAPS BEGIN 

763
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,952
TO TILT MORE TO THE RIGHT. 

764
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:27,886
OF COURSE, THE ONE THING TO 

765
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,287
REMEMBER IS WHEN SOMEBODY IS ON 

766
00:21:29,287 --> 00:21:30,889
THE COURT, THERE'S NO GUARANTEE 

767
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:32,424
THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE A CERTAIN 

768
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:33,024
WAY. 

769
00:21:33,024 --> 00:21:34,593
A LOT OF CONSERVATIVES ARE 

770
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:37,229
STILL UPSET WITH CHIEF JUSTICE 

771
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,731
ROBERTS FOR THE WAY HE SIDED 

772
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:40,798
WITH THE LIBERAL JUSTICES TO 

773
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:41,633
UPHOLD MOST OF THE ACQUISITION 

774
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,136
ACT A FEW YEARS AGO EVER SINCE 

775
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,704
-- AFFORDABLE CARE ACT A FEW 

776
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:47,272
YEARS AGO EVER SINCE THEN AND 

777
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:48,807
PRESIDENT TRUMP CAMPAIGNED 

778
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,008
VOWING TO PUT JUSTICES ON THE 

779
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:51,910
COURT WHO WOULDN'T DO WHAT 

780
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:52,243
ROBERTS DID. 

781
00:21:52,243 --> 00:21:53,979
SO IF THIS PERSON PROVES TO BE 

782
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,013
THE CONSERVATIVE MANY 

783
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,415
REPUBLICANS ARE HOPING FOR, IT 

784
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,717
WILL BE SEEN AS A BIG SUCCESS. 

785
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:02,187
>> ED, I WONDER WHAT YOU'VE 

786
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,622
BEEN HEARING ABOUT THE 

787
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:06,024
POLITICAL PRESSURE ON THOSE 

788
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:10,028
DEMOCRATS IN RED STATES AND I 

789
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:11,363
KNOW YOU'VE TALKED TO THE 

790
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:15,300
OFFICES OF SEVERAL OF THOSE 

791
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:15,600
DEMOCRATS. 

792
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,636
THERE YOU SEE, BY THE WAY, VICE 

793
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:18,704
PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE AND MITCH 

794
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,505
McCONNELL IN THE EAST ROOM. 

795
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,340
I BELIEVE SENATOR GRASSLEY IS 

796
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:22,673
BEHIND THERE. 

797
00:22:22,673 --> 00:22:24,910
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN HEARING, ED, 

798
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,311
ABOUT WHAT IT IS THEY'RE FACING 

799
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:30,449
HERE AS THEY TRY TO FIGURE OUT 

800
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,317
A STRATEGY TO NAVIGATE THIS 

801
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:32,884
PARTICULAR ISSUE? 

802
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:37,522
>> Reporter:  I GOT ON THE 

803
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,724
PHONE WITH DEMOCRATIC AIDES 

804
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:39,925
TODAY AND THE PHONE 

805
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:41,059
CONVERSATION BEGAN WITH SOME 

806
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:42,027
KIND OF A SIGH FROM THEM 

807
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,562
BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHAT'S COMING 

808
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:43,829
HERE. 

809
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,597
IT'S GOING TO BE AN INTENSE 

810
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:47,532
AMOUNT OF PRESSURE APPLIED FROM 

811
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,935
HERE IN WASHINGTON AND BACK 

812
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,136
HOME, ESPECIALLY ON THE AIR 

813
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,704
WAVES, BUT ALSO AMONG 

814
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,606
GRASSROOTS GROUPS WHO ARE GOING 

815
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:55,707
TO BE PUSHING FOR THEIR 

816
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,976
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR UP FOR 

817
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:01,213
REELECTION THIS YEAR TO SUPPORT 

818
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,415
WHOEVER IT IS THE PRESIDENT 

819
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:04,816
NOMINATES, BUT LOOK, YOU TALK 

820
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:05,917
TO DEMOCRATS ESPECIALLY AND 

821
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:08,420
THEY SAY WE DON'T NECESSARILY 

822
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,722
SEE EVIDENCE RIGHT NOW THAT HOW 

823
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:11,456
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS AND 

824
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:12,958
REPUBLICAN SENATORS VOTE ON THE 

825
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,660
SUPREME COURT IS GOING TO BE AS 

826
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,064
BIG OF MOTIVATING FACTOR AS 

827
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,366
GENERAL CONCERNS ABOUT 

828
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:24,369
HEALTHCARE, THE TAX REFORM 

829
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:25,604
PLAN, CONTINUED QUESTIONS ABOUT 

830
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:26,905
LEGAL ISSUES SURROUNDING THE 

831
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:27,238
WHITE HOUSE. 

832
00:23:27,238 --> 00:23:28,807
YOU SAY LOOK, ALL THOSE ISSUES 

833
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,008
COULD COME BEFORE THE COURT IN 

834
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:31,543
THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND THEY SAY 

835
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:32,744
YES, OF COURSE, BUT WHAT'S 

836
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,112
GOING TO DRIVE PEOPLE OUT IS 

837
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,214
NOT SOMEBODY HAS BEEN NOMINATED 

838
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:37,983
OR NOT, WHETHER OR NOT THEY'VE 

839
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:38,416
BEEN CONFIRMED. 

840
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,218
IT'S ALL THESE OTHER AS THEY 

841
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:42,187
KEPT SAYING KITCHEN TABLE 

842
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:47,659
ISSUES THEY BELIEVE WILL DRIVE 

843
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:49,694
TURNOUT. 

844
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:52,764
I THINK BEYOND THE MOST BASE 

845
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,699
VOTERS ON THE OTHER SIDE IS 

846
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:58,469
THERE GOING TO BE OTHERS. 

847
00:23:58,469 --> 00:24:01,740
COULD IT BE A LAST MINUTE WEDGE 

848
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,675
ISSUE OR MOTIVATING FACTOR? 

849
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:03,942
PERHAPS. 

850
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,611
>> ED, THERE WE SEE THE 

851
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,412
PRESIDENT'S ATTORNEY, RUDY 

852
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:09,314
GUILIANI, AMONG THOSE WHO HAVE 

853
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:11,016
GATHERED THERE IN THE EAST 

854
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:11,216
ROOM. 

855
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,218
I WONDER, ED, IF I COULD GET 

856
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,419
YOUR THOUGHTS BECAUSE AMONG 

857
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:16,721
THOSE LAWMAKERS AS WELL THAT 

858
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:17,889
YOU MENTIONED, THE REPUBLICAN 

859
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:19,758
LAWMAKERS WHO WERE INVITED, 

860
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:23,762
THERE WE SEE REPUBLICAN SENATOR 

861
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,396
JEFF FLAKE OF ARIZONA. 

862
00:24:25,396 --> 00:24:27,365
REMIND OUR VIEWERS, ED, WHAT 

863
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:28,499
HAS BEEN THE RELATIONSHIP 

864
00:24:28,499 --> 00:24:30,368
BETWEEN THIS WHITE HOUSE AND 

865
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:30,702
THAT SENATOR? 

866
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:32,137
>> Reporter:  THERE'S A REASON 

867
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,838
JEFF FLAKE SHOWS UP FOR THIS. 

868
00:24:33,838 --> 00:24:36,608
WHILE THEY'VE HAD DISAGREEMENTS 

869
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,909
OVER TONE AND TEMPERAMENT, 

870
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,712
THEIR OPINIONS ON JOHN McCAIN 

871
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:42,314
AND TRADE ISSUES, THE ONE AREA 

872
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,548
WHERE JEFF FLAKE HAS ALWAYS 

873
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:45,116
BEEN IN NEAR LOCK STEP WITH THE 

874
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:47,285
PRESIDENT AND THE WHITE HOUSE 

875
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:48,953
IS ON JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS. 

876
00:24:48,953 --> 00:24:51,323
HE HAS TOLD ME AND OTHERS HERE 

877
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,025
AT CBS REPEATEDLY HOW PLEASED 

878
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:56,328
HE'S BEEN WITH THE WHITE 

879
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,562
HOUSE'S MANAGEMENT OF JUDICIAL 

880
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:58,463
APPOINTMENTS, GETTING THEM UP 

881
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:00,065
TO THE SENATE, GETTING THE 

882
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,333
SENATE TO CONFIRM THEM AND 

883
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,234
PICKING PEOPLE WHO HE BELIEVES 

884
00:25:03,234 --> 00:25:04,035
ARE SUFFICIENTLY CONSERVATIVE 

885
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:05,737
AND QUALIFIED TO BE ON BENCH. 

886
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:07,138
HE WAS THRILLED WITH THE NEIL 

887
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:09,140
GORSUCH DECISION LAST YEAR IN 

888
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,109
PART BECAUSE GORSUCH HAILS FROM 

889
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:13,144
THE WEST AND IS NOT SOMEBODY 

890
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:15,814
WHO RESIDES OR STUDIED OR WAS 

891
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:17,949
BORN EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI. 

892
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:19,451
THAT PROBABLY WON'T BE THE CASE 

893
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:20,719
TONIGHT AS THE FOUR NAMES THAT 

894
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,821
WE KNOW ARE IN THE MIX ARE ALL 

895
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:24,022
FROM EITHER THE CENTRAL TIME 

896
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:27,759
ZONE OR EASTERN TIME ZONE, BUT 

897
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:31,262
FLAKE AS A MEMBER OF THE 

898
00:25:31,262 --> 00:25:31,930
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HAS BEEN 

899
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,032
QUITE PLEASED WITH THE WAY THE 

900
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,333
ADMINISTRATION HAS HANDLED 

901
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,267
JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS AND 

902
00:25:36,267 --> 00:25:37,234
THAT'S WHY HE'S THERE TONIGHT. 

903
00:25:37,234 --> 00:25:40,438
>> AS WE CONTINUE TO SEE 

904
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:41,740
LAWMAKERS AND JUDICIARIES FILE 

905
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,808
INTO THE EAST ROOM, THERE'S 

906
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:46,011
SENATOR TED CRUZ OF TEXAS, HOW 

907
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,113
GALVANIZING OF AN ISSUE DO YOU 

908
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,981
THINK THIS SUPREME COURT PICK 

909
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:56,488
WILL BE FOR REPUBLICANS THIS 

910
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:56,988
MIDTERM ELECTION YEAR? 

911
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:57,522
>> Reporter:  ABSOLUTELY 

912
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:59,224
GALVANIZING BECAUSE YOU WILL 

913
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,725
SEE THE ESTABLISHMENT CLOSE 

914
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:01,258
RANKS BEHIND WHOEVER THE 

915
00:26:01,258 --> 00:26:02,160
NOMINEE IS AND PUSH TO INSURE 

916
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,230
THAT THIS PERSON IS SWIFTLY 

917
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:05,530
CONFIRMED. 

918
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,065
WHETHER PEOPLE TURN OUT IN 

919
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,067
NOVEMBER TO THANK THE PRESIDENT 

920
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,903
AND SENATE REPUBLICANS FOR 

921
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:12,537
GETTING THIS PERSON ON TO THE 

922
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:14,739
COURT IF IT'S DONE BY ELECTION 

923
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,441
DAY REMAINS TO BE SEEN, BUT YOU 

924
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:18,143
BETTER BELIEVE THAT IN THE 

925
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:20,211
COMING HOURS THIS PERSON WILL 

926
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:21,546
QUICKLY BECOME A WELL KNOWN 

927
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:23,248
NAME AMONG CONSERVATIVES IN 

928
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,050
THIS COUNTRY WHO SUPPORT THE 

929
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:25,684
PRESIDENT, REPUBLICANS WHO ARE 

930
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:28,520
CONCERNED ABOUT THE BALANCE OF 

931
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:28,820
THE COURT. 

932
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,389
LET'S REMEMBER BACK IN 2016 

933
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:32,757
ROUGHLY 20% OF VOTERS SAID IN 

934
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,459
THE EXIT POLLS ONE OF THE 

935
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:35,326
REASONS THEY TURNED OUT AND 

936
00:26:35,326 --> 00:26:36,361
VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP WAS OUT 

937
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:39,264
OF CONCERN OVER THE FUTURE OF 

938
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,265
THE IDEOLOGICAL BALANCE OF THE 

939
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:40,632
SUPREME COURT. 

940
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:42,367
THAT WAS THE HIGHEST THAT THE 

941
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:43,468
SUPREME COURT HAD EVER MEASURED 

942
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:47,305
IN SORT OF ISSUES OF CONCERN ON 

943
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:47,939
A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION DAY. 

944
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,641
FOR THE LAST THREE WEEK OF THE 

945
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:50,942
CAMPAIGN DONALD TRUMP TRAVELED 

946
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,944
THE COUNTRY SAYING YOU MAY NOT 

947
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:53,511
LIKE ME PERSONALLY, BUT YOU 

948
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:55,747
KNOW THAT I'M GOING TO APPOINT 

949
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:57,148
SOMEBODY FAR MORE CONSERVATIVE 

950
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:57,982
THAN HILLARY CLINTON EVER WOULD 

951
00:26:57,982 --> 00:26:59,284
AND THE EXIT POLLING SHOWED IN 

952
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,886
THE END THAT THAT WAS A 

953
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:04,456
MOTIVATING FACTOR FOR MANY 

954
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,890
REPUBLICANS, CONSERVATIVES OR 

955
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:06,490
RIGHT LEANING INDEPENDENS WHO 

956
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,893
SHOWED UP TO VOTE FOR HIM ON 

957
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:09,226
ELECTION DAY. 

958
00:27:09,226 --> 00:27:11,329
>> ED O'KEEFE IN WASHINGTON FOR 

959
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:14,499
US, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

960
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:15,767
WHOMEVER PRESIDENT TRUMP PICKS 

961
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,102
AS HIS SUPREME COURT NOMINEE 

962
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:18,303
WILL HAVE A LASTING IMPACT ON 

963
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,771
THE INTERPRETATION OF U.S. LAW 

964
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,039
FOR DECADES TO COME. 

965
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,841
THE FOUR LEADING CANDIDATES 

966
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:23,874
HAVE SEVERAL SIMILARITIES. 

967
00:27:23,874 --> 00:27:28,146
THEY'RE ALL APPELLATE JUDGES,  

968
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,280
UNDER THE AGE OF 53 AND 

969
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,781
CONSIDERED RIGHT OF CENTER 

970
00:27:30,781 --> 00:27:32,350
POLITICALLY, BUT THEY ALL HAVE 

971
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,885
PLENTY OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 

972
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:34,085
THEM. 

973
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:36,654
JOINING ME NOW IS JESSE WEBER, 

974
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:38,189
ATTORNEY AND HOST OF THE CRIME 

975
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:38,456
NETWORK. 

976
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:40,157
WE ONLY HAVE A COUPLE MINUTES 

977
00:27:40,157 --> 00:27:42,393
LEFT, BUT ONE OF THE BIGGEST 

978
00:27:42,393 --> 00:27:44,662
TOPICS IN WASHINGTON AFTER 

979
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:45,497
JUSTICE ANTHONY KENNEDY 

980
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,332
ANNOUNCED HIS RETIREMENT WAS 

981
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,267
WHAT THE FUTURE OF ROE VERSUS 

982
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:49,868
WADE WOULD BE. 

983
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:52,370
HELP ME UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMIC 

984
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:52,470
HERE. 

985
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:55,940
WITH THESE PICKS WAS THERE ONE 

986
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,942
NOMINEE OR ONE POTENTIAL 

987
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:00,645
NOMINEE IN PARTICULAR THAT 

988
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:03,548
STOOD OUT IN TERMS OF BEING 

989
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:05,049
PARTICULARLY FORCEFUL AGAINST 

990
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:05,449
ABORTION RIGHTS? 

991
00:28:05,449 --> 00:28:07,352
>> I'M SO HAPPY YOU BROUGHT 

992
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:07,619
THIS UP. 

993
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,754
EVERYBODY CONSIDERS THAT A 

994
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:10,555
MAJORITY CONSERVATIVE COURT 

995
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:14,025
AUTOMATICALLY MEANS ROE V. WADE 

996
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:14,458
WILL BE OVERTURNED. 

997
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:16,794
IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THE 

998
00:28:16,794 --> 00:28:17,996
NOMINEES, NO ONE HAS MADE AN 

999
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:19,798
EXPLICIT STATEMENT SAYING I'M 

1000
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:20,298
GOING TO OVERTURN THIS. 

1001
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:21,933
WHEN YOU LOOK AT AMY BARRETT, 

1002
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:23,201
THOUGH, SHE HAS MADE IT VERY 

1003
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,904
CLEAR THAT SHE LOOKS AT 

1004
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:40,185
PRECEDENT A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY.

1005
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:43,154
IT GIVES THE IDEA AND REMEMBER 

1006
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:44,956
THAT CASE WAS DECIDED ON A 

1007
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:46,591
RIGHT OF PRIVACY GROUNDS AND 

1008
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:47,992
SHE HAS SAID THE CONSTITUTION 

1009
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:49,694
DOESN'T EXPRESSLY PROTECT THAT 

1010
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:49,927
RIGHT. 

1011
00:28:49,927 --> 00:28:51,496
SO IF I'M INTERPRETING HER AS 

1012
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:52,397
SHE WOULD INTERPRET THE 

1013
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,097
CONSTITUTION, PEOPLE COULD LOOK 

1014
00:28:53,097 --> 00:28:55,133
AT HER AND SAY SHE MIGHT BE A 

1015
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,701
THREAT TO ROE V. WADE. 

1016
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:58,870
JUST TO STEP BACK, NO MATTER 

1017
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,472
WHO IS NOMINATED IT'S NOT THAT 

1018
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,340
SIMPLE TO GET THAT OVERTURNED. 

1019
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,175
IT IS A LONG PROCESS. 

1020
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:05,210
YOU NEED THE RIGHT CASE. 

1021
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,778
YOU NEED IT TO GO THROUGH THE 

1022
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:07,111
COURT SYSTEM. 

1023
00:29:07,111 --> 00:29:08,279
THE SUPREME COURT HAS TO TAKE 

1024
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,547
IT UP AND THEY HAVE TO DECIDE 

1025
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:11,549
IT ON A SPECIFIC ISSUE. 

1026
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:15,153
AGAIN WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT A 

1027
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:15,987
MAJORITY SUPREME COURT, YES, 

1028
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:17,421
THAT'S THE CONVERSATION. 

1029
00:29:18,489 --> 00:29:21,392
>> JESSE, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

1030
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:43,080
>>> THIS IS A CBS NEWS SPECIAL 

1031
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,314

COMING TO AN END. 

1036
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:49,587
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ABOUT TO

THIS WILL BE MR. TRUMP'S SECOND

APPOINTMENT AFTER NEIL GORSUCH 

1043

YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT RIGHT 

1051
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:11,075
NOW IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS. 

1052

THOSE IMAGES WE WERE JUST

OF COURSE, FROM THE VERY 

1070
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:36,834
BEGINNING, JUDGE BRETT 

1071
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:39,838
KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN THE FRONT 

1072
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,072
RUNNER AND A GOOD CLUE IS HIS 

1073
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:41,706

THE ROOM AS WELL AS SEVERAL OF 

1075
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:45,009
HIS FRIENDS AND ASSOCIATES. 

1076
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,310
THE PRESIDENT LIKES TO KEEP 

1077
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,512
THINGS DRAMATIC AND CERTAINLY 

1078
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,882
HE IS KEEPING THIS CLOSE UNTIL 

1079
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:51,449
THE VERY END. 

1080
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:53,184
BUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH WOULD BE A 

1081
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,652
SOLID CONSERVATIVE PICK. 

1082
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:56,421
CONSERVATIVES WOULD BE VERY 

1083
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:56,821
HAPPY WITH THIS. 

1084
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:59,023

1304
00:41:24,948 --> 00:41:29,887

1306

I WAS LUCKY. 

1307
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:33,623
MY MOM WAS A TEACHER. 

1308
00:41:33,623 --> 00:41:35,793
IN THE 1960s AND 70s, SHE 

1309
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,994

HER EXAMPLE TAUGHT ME THE 

1315
00:41:46,603 --> 00:41:49,740
IMPORTANCE OF EQUALITY FOR ALL 

1316
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,040
AMERICANS. 

1317
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,910
MY MOM WAS A TRAIL BLAZER. 

1318
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,045
WHEN I WAS TEN, SHE WENT TO LAW 

1319
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:57,748

1320
00:41:57,748 --> 00:42:00,183
MY INTRODUCTION TO LAW CAME AT

SHE PRACTICED HER CLOSING 

1323

1324
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:08,959
HER TRADEMARK LINE WAS USE YOUR 

1325
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:10,027

WHAT RINGS TRUE, WHAT RINGS 

1327
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:14,197
FALSE? 

1328
00:42:14,197 --> 00:42:16,533
THAT'S GOOD ADVICE FOR A JUROR 

1329
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:17,634
AND FOR A SON. 

1330
00:42:17,634 --> 00:42:19,737

THE PRESIDENT INTRODUCED ME

ALWAYS BELONG TO MY MOM. 

1338
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,652
MY DAD WENT TO LAW SCHOOL AT 

1339
00:42:35,652 --> 00:42:39,690
NIGHT WHILE WORKING FULL TIME. 

1340
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,458
HE HAS AN UNPARALLEL WORK 

1341
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:42,926

I LOVE HIM DEARLY. 

1345
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:52,736
THE MOTTO OF MY HIGH SCHOOL WAS 

1346
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:53,603
MAN FOR OTHERS. 

1347
00:42:53,603 --> 00:42:56,206
I HAVE TRIED TO LIVE THAT 

1348
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:56,439
CREED. 

1349
00:42:56,439 --> 00:42:57,741

MY JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY IS 

1359
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:16,727
STRAIGHTFORWARD. 

1360
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,194
A JUDGE MUST BE INDEPENDENT AND 

1361
00:43:18,194 --> 00:43:21,398
MUST INTERPRET THE LAW, NOT 

1362
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:21,731
MAKE THE LAW. 

1363
00:43:21,731 --> 00:43:24,567
A JUDGE MUST INTERPRET STATUTES 

1364
00:43:24,567 --> 00:43:24,901

1365
00:43:24,901 --> 00:43:29,706

00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:17,200
PLAYS AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN THIS 

1457
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:17,467
PROCESS. 

1458
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:21,171
I WILL TELL EACH SENATOR THAT I 

1459
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,072
REVERE THE CONSTITUTION. 

1460
00:47:23,072 --> 00:47:25,475
I BELIEVE THAT AN INDEPENDENT 

1461
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:29,346
JUDICIARY IS THE CROWN JEWEL OF 

1462
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,214
OUR CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC. 

1463
00:47:31,214 --> 00:47:33,216
IF CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE, I 

1464
00:47:33,216 --> 00:47:37,988
WILL KEEP AN OPEN MIND IN EVERY 

1465
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:41,391
CASE, AND I WILL ALWAYS STRIVE 

1466
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:42,159
TO PRESERVE THE CONSTITUTION OF 

1467
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:43,694
THE UNITED STATES AND THE 

1468
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,062
AMERICAN RULE OF LAW. 

1469
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:45,629
THANK YOU, MR.  PRESIDENT. 

1470
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:49,833

1471
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:57,240

1472
00:47:57,406 --> 00:48:01,478
[ APPLAUSE ]    

1473
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:41,718
>> SO THERE YOU GO IT IS BRETT 

1474
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:42,852
KAVANAUGH THERE WITH HIS TWO 

1475

DAUGHTERS AND HIS WIFE AS HE 

1476

00:48:50,026 --> 00:48:50,960
PRESIDENT AND BRETT KAVANAUGH

LOOKING OUT AT HIS PARENTS IN 

1479
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:53,296
THE AUDIENCE. 

1480
00:48:53,296 --> 00:48:55,098
ONE COULD ONLY IMAGINE WHAT'S 

1481
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:57,267
GOING THROUGH THEIR MINDS AT A 

1482
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,202
MOMENT LIKE THIS. 

1483
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:00,303
JAN, AS WE WATCH EVERYTHING 

1484
00:49:00,303 --> 00:49:01,271
WRAP UP HERE, JAN CRAWFORD BACK 

1485
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,407
WITH US NOW AS WELL AS MARGARET 

1486
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:04,608
BRENNAN, WHAT DOES THIS PICK 

1487
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,742
TELL YOU, JAN? 

1488
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:06,809
>> WELL, I THINK THIS PICK 

1489
00:49:06,809 --> 00:49:08,512
SHOWS THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO 

1490
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:09,946
IS NOT GOING TO PULL ANY 

1491
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:10,380
PUNCHES. 

1492
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,415
HE WAS GOING TO HAVE A FIGHT TO 

1493
00:49:12,415 --> 00:49:13,516
GET A NOMINEE THAT HE BELIEVED 

1494
00:49:13,516 --> 00:49:16,019
WAS GOING TO BE A CONSERVATIVE 

1495
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:17,320
INTELLECTUAL FORCE ON THE 

1496
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:17,687
SUPREME COURT. 

1497
00:49:17,687 --> 00:49:18,989
HE IS GOING TO TAKE THAT FIGHT 

1498
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:20,857
RIGHT TO THE DEMOCRATS WHO 

1499
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:22,425
CERTAINLY OPPOSED HIM FOR HIS 

1500
00:49:22,425 --> 00:49:23,526
APPELLATE COURT NOMINATION. 

1501
00:49:23,526 --> 00:49:24,661
>> BECAUSE KAVANAUGH HAS A 

1502
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:26,362
RECORD AND THEY WILL HAVE TO GO 

1503
00:49:26,362 --> 00:49:26,696
THROUGH THAT. 

1504
00:49:26,696 --> 00:49:28,131
IT COULD BE THIS FIGHT NOW. 

1505
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,666
>> ABSOLUTELY, BUT THE 

1506
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:30,434
PRESIDENT IS SAYING I'M WILLING 

1507
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:33,003
TO DO IT, I AM GOING TO MAKE 

1508
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:34,271
THIS SUPREME COURT, I 

1509
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:35,705
CAMPAIGNED ON THIS, AND I AM 

1510
00:49:35,705 --> 00:49:36,005
DELIVERING. 

1511
00:49:36,005 --> 00:49:38,341
THERE IS NO QUESTION, I MEAN 

1512
00:49:38,341 --> 00:49:39,276
WITH THIS NOMINATION, PRESIDENT 

1513
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:41,344
TRUMP MAY WELL DO WHAT 

1514
00:49:41,344 --> 00:49:42,245
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS HAVE 

1515
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:44,181
TRIED TO DO FOR 40 YEARS AND 

1516
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:44,414
FAILED. 

1517
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:47,150
AND THAT IS TO TURN THE SUPREME 

1518
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,753
COURT INTO MORE CLEARLY SOLIDLY 

1519
00:49:49,753 --> 00:49:50,821
CONSERVATIVE DIRECTION AND AWAY 

1520
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,223
FROM WHAT THEY SEE IS THE REAL 

1521
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:53,490
EXCESSES. 

1522
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,291
I EAN IT HAD IS A GENERATIONAL 

1523
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:57,928
PICK THAT COULD AFFECT 

1524
00:49:57,928 --> 00:50:02,132
GENERATIONS TO COME. 

1525
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:04,267
>> THERE WAS PRESSURE UNDER THE 

1526
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:05,936
PRESIDENT, ON THE PRESIDENT TO 

1527
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:07,404
MAYBE PLAY IT SAFE, TO GO WITH 

1528
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:08,438
SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T HAVE A 

1529
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:10,273
RECORD, WHO DIDN'T HAVE A PAPER 

1530
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:10,506
TRAIL. 

1531
00:50:10,506 --> 00:50:11,775
I THINK WITH THIS PICK, HE SAYS 

1532
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:12,875
NO, BRING IT. 

1533
00:50:12,875 --> 00:50:14,578
>> MARGARET, TALK ABOUT THE 

1534
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:15,511
NOMINATION PROCESS AND WHAT'S 

1535
00:50:15,511 --> 00:50:15,811
AHEAD HERE? 

1536
00:50:15,811 --> 00:50:17,347
>> THERE IS VERY LITTLE 

1537
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:18,682
DEMOCRATS COULD DO TO STOP THE 

1538
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,050
SWING OF THE COURT AS JAN LAID 

1539
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:23,286
OUT TOWARDS MORE CONSERVATIVE 

1540
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:23,653
LEANINGS HERE. 

1541
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:25,354
BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY 

1542
00:50:25,354 --> 00:50:27,957
IS SUCH A SLIM RAZOR-THIN 

1543
00:50:27,957 --> 00:50:30,026
MARGIN, REALLY ANY ONE SENATOR 

1544
00:50:30,026 --> 00:50:31,761
CROSSING OVER COULD MAKE OR 

1545
00:50:31,761 --> 00:50:32,228
BREAK THIS NOMINEE. 

1546
00:50:32,228 --> 00:50:35,265
AND SO THAT IS WHY THE 

1547
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:38,168
POLITICKING OF THIS IS GOING TO 

1548
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:38,601
GET GOING TOMORROW. 

1549
00:50:38,601 --> 00:50:39,969
HE VICE PRESIDENT WILL  

1550
00:50:39,969 --> 00:50:41,604
KAVANAUGH TO THE HILL, TAKE HIM 

1551
00:50:41,604 --> 00:50:42,806
AROUND, MAKE THE INTRODUCTIONS. 

1552
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:44,608
THEY ARE GOING TO BE FOCUSING 

1553
00:50:44,608 --> 00:50:47,110
ON WINNING OVER SOME OF THESE 

1554
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:49,880
RED STATE DEMOCRATS TO TRY TO 

1555
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,348
GET THIS CONFIRMATION IN PLACE 

1556
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:53,883
BY EARLY OCTOBER AHEAD OF THOSE 

1557
00:50:53,883 --> 00:50:54,350
CONGRESSIONAL RACES. 

1558
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:55,384
IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE THE 

1559
00:50:55,384 --> 00:50:57,287
PRESIDENT EMBRACE SOMEONE WHO 

1560
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:59,322
IS SO CLOSE TO THE BUSH FAMILY. 

1561
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:01,291
WE ARE SEEING SUCH A WARM 

1562
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:03,727
RECEPTION FROM THEM, FROM THE 

1563
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:04,828

END THE ESTABLISHMENT WHEN HE 

1566
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:07,831
CAME HERE. 

1567
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:08,765
>> THE SUPREME COURT WILL BE 

1568
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:10,734
HUGE TALKS ON THE CAMPAIGN 

1569
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,635

1636
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:20,363
HE WAS THE FAVORITE OF DON 

1637
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,132
MCGAHN, THE WHITE HOUSE 

1638
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:22,399
COUNCIL. 

1639
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:23,967
A LEADING CANDIDATE ALL THE WAY 

1640
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:25,635
THROUGH, DID NOT MAKE THE FIRST 

1641
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:26,803
LIST TRUMP PUT OUT OR THE 

1642
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:29,172
SECOND ONE WHEN HE WAS ADDED IN 

1643
00:53:29,172 --> 00:53:31,441
NOVEMBER, BUT CERTAINLY VERY 

1644
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:36,145
STRONG REPUTATION FOR 

1645
00:53:36,145 --> 00:53:36,880
CONSERVATIVE, STRUCTURAL, 

1646
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,081
ORIGINALIST OPINIONS FORCING 

1647
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:40,216
THE SEPARATIONS OF POWERS, 

1648
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:42,819
PUSHING BACK ON THE 

1649
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:47,357
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, MEANING ON 

1650
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:47,790
EXECUTIVE AGENCIES. 

1651
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:49,792
THAT IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE 

1652
00:53:49,792 --> 00:53:51,361
AAA, THE SECOND MOST 

1653
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:54,464
PRESTIGIOUS COURT IN THE LAND 

1654
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:54,864
HANDLING APPEALS. 

1655
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:56,999
>> WELL ILYA, WHAT DO WE KNOW 

1656
00:53:56,999 --> 00:53:58,401
ABOUT THIS NOW, WHAT WE ASSUME 

1657
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,503
TO BE A CONFIRMATION FIGHT THAT 

1658
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:01,804
WILL BE A DIFFICULT FIGHT. 

1659
00:54:01,804 --> 00:54:05,541
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HIS 

1660
00:54:05,541 --> 00:54:06,676
PARTICULAR JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY 

1661
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:07,977
BASED ON THE DECISIONS HE HAS 

1662
00:54:07,977 --> 00:54:10,046
MADE SO FAR THAT COULD BE A 

1663
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:11,548
FOCAL POINT FOR DEMOCRATS? 

1664
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:13,983
>> WELL BOTH HIS DECISIONS AND 

1665
00:54:13,983 --> 00:54:15,584
SPEECHES IN WRITINGS. 

1666
00:54:15,584 --> 00:54:17,854
HE PUBLISHES AN HOUR OF ONE 

1667
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:20,390
ARTICLE A YEAR AND HE DOES HAVE 

1668
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:21,458
A BIG PUBLIC PROFILE. 

1669
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:22,992
THAT'S A PART OF THE REASON WHY 

1670
00:54:22,992 --> 00:54:24,127
HE HAS ATTRACTED A BIG 

1671
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:25,962
FOLLOWING.    

1672
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:31,468
I DON'T KNOW IF ANYTHING IS 

1673
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:32,702
NECESSARILY GOING TO ATTACK 

1674
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:34,336
SMEARS, ATTACKS WHAT HAVE YOU. 

1675
00:54:34,336 --> 00:54:35,271
HOWEVER WHO WAS GOING TO BE 

1676
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:36,873
THERE WOULD BE A BIG OPPOSITION 

1677
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:38,475
AS THEY HAD THOSE SIGNS 

1678
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:40,009
PROTESTING OUTSIDE THE SUPREME 

1679
00:54:40,009 --> 00:54:40,810
COURT WITH A BLANK SPACE, BUT 

1680
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:43,713
THEY ARE NOW ALL TRYING TO 

1681
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:49,552
WRITE ON KAVANAUGH.    

1682
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:52,822
BUT PROBABLY HIS SERVICE IN THE 

1683
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:53,522
BUSH WHITE HOUSE WILL ATTRACT 

1684
00:54:53,522 --> 00:54:54,957
MORE OF HIS OPINIONS. 

1685
00:54:54,957 --> 00:54:57,226
HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY FOUR SQUARE 

1686
00:54:57,226 --> 00:54:57,793
CULTURE WAR OPINIONS ON GAY 

1687
00:54:57,793 --> 00:55:00,764
MARRIAGE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. 

1688
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:03,900
ON GUNS, HE WAS PRETTY STRONG 

1689
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,402
IN DEFENDING THE RIGHT TO KEEP 

1690
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:07,971
BARE ARMS, BUT NOT ANYTHING 

1691
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,906
CRAZY LIKE APPROVING MACHINE 

1692
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:10,873
GUNS OR HAVING NO RESTRICTIONS 

1693
00:55:10,873 --> 00:55:11,173
WHATSOEVER. 

1694
00:55:11,173 --> 00:55:13,142
HE WILL BE QUESTIONED ON LOTS 

1695
00:55:13,142 --> 00:55:13,743
OF THINGS. 

1696
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:15,244
ESPECIALLY ROE V. WADE SEEMS TO 

1697
00:55:15,244 --> 00:55:17,313
BE BROUGHT UP EVEN MORE THAN IT 

1698
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:18,581
HAS BEEN IN THE PAST. 

1699
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:20,784
LOOK FOR THAT AT HIS HEARINGS.  

1700
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:22,385
BUT YOU KNOW, HE DOESN'T HAVE 

1701
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:23,653
ANY RED FLAGS THAT WAY. 

1702
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:27,891
I DOUBT HE'S THE SORT OF PERSON 

1703
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:28,891
THAT SUSAN COLLINS, THE FOCAL 

1704
00:55:28,891 --> 00:55:29,892
POINT WOULD OBJECT TO. 

1705
00:55:29,892 --> 00:55:31,460
THAT MEANS EVEN THOUGH THE 

1706
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:33,663
REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IS NARROW, 

1707
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:34,964
VERY NARROW, GIVEN NO 

1708
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:37,400
FILIBUSTER, HE SHOULD BE 

1709
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:37,700
CONFIRMED. 

1710
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:40,169
>> REMIND US THOUGH, THERE HAVE 

1711
00:55:40,169 --> 00:55:42,472
BEEN SOME CONSERVATIVES WHO 

1712
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:44,540
FELT BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS NOT 

1713
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:45,975
SUFFICIENTLY CONSERVATIVE, THAT 

1714
00:55:45,975 --> 00:55:47,243
HE WASN'T CONSERVATIVE ENOUGH. 

1715
00:55:47,243 --> 00:55:48,678
WHY WAS THAT? 

1716
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:49,478
WHAT WAS THEIR ARGUMENT? 

1717
00:55:49,478 --> 00:55:50,980
>> WELL, I SHARE A CERTAIN 

1718
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:53,382
CONCERN THAT HE'S TOO MUCH LIKE 

1719
00:55:53,382 --> 00:55:55,985
JOHN ROBERTS, NOT ENOUGH LIKE A 

1720
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:57,854
GORSUCH OR A THOMAS, WHICH 

1721
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:00,223
ISN'T TO SAY HE'S A SECRET LEFT 

1722
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:01,457
WINGER OR A SQUISHY MODERATE. 

1723
00:56:01,457 --> 00:56:02,091
NOTHING LIKE THAT. 

1724
00:56:02,091 --> 00:56:04,393
BUT THERE ARE DIFFERENT VIEWS. 

1725
00:56:04,393 --> 00:56:08,098
NOT JUST OF ORIGINALISM OR 

1726
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:09,032
TEXTURALLISM, BUT THE PROPER 

1727
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,233
MODE OF THE JUDGE, THE PROPER 

1728
00:56:11,233 --> 00:56:12,468
ROLE OF A JUDGE. 

1729
00:56:12,468 --> 00:56:13,469
HOW RESTRAINED ARE YOU. 

1730
00:56:13,469 --> 00:56:16,339
DO YOU TRY TO MAKE NARROW 

1731
00:56:16,339 --> 00:56:17,707
DECISIONS OR BROADER ONES? 

1732
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:21,110
AND KAVANAUGH HAS A REPUTATION 

1733
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:22,345
FOR BEING VERY SHREWD IN TERMS 

1734
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:24,948
OF HOW HE IS DECIDING THESE 

1735
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:25,181
CASES. 

1736
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:28,117
NOT NECESSARILY WITHIN AN 

1737
00:56:28,117 --> 00:56:30,419
AGENDA TO OVERRULE LARGE SWATHS 

1738
00:56:30,419 --> 00:56:30,820
OF PRECEDENT. 

1739
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,655
I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE ENOUGH 

1740
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:34,357
FOR CONSERVATIVES TO COME OUT 

1741
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:38,027
AND START ATTACKING HIM OR 

1742
00:56:38,027 --> 00:56:41,964
LIBERTARIANS, POP EWE POPULIST. 

1743
00:56:41,964 --> 00:56:43,666
SO I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE 

1744
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:46,436
MORE ATTACKS FROM THE LEFT. 

1745
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:48,772
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT EVERYBODY, 

1746
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:50,006
ALL CONSERVATIVES OR 

1747
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:50,640
REPUBLICANS, TRUMP SUPPORTERS, 

1748
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,975
THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY GOING 

1749
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:53,610
TO BE ECSTATIC WITH HIM. 

1750
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:54,710
DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAD DIFFERENT 

1751
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:56,012
FAVORITES, BUT I DON'T THINK 

1752
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:58,381
HE'LL RAISE THE KIND OF RED 

1753
00:56:58,381 --> 00:57:01,817
FLAGS THAT HAPPEN UNDER SAY 

1754
00:57:01,817 --> 00:57:02,451
HARRIET MEYERS WHILE WITHDRAWN 

1755
00:57:02,451 --> 00:57:04,053
OR OTHER PEOPLE CRITICIZED 

1756
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:04,320
HARSHLY. 

1757
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,455
>> YOU MENTIONED IN SPEAKING OF 

1758
00:57:06,455 --> 00:57:07,824
BRETT KAVANAUGH, IT HAD TERM 

1759
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:21,437
BEING A TECH TECH -- 

1760
00:57:21,437 --> 00:57:33,149
TEXTURALLIST? 

1761
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:35,218
YOU DON'T TRY TO FIGURE OUT 

1762
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:37,220
WHAT THEY MIGHT HAVE INTENDED 

1763
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:42,459
TO DO BY LOOKING AT COMMITTEE 

1764
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,459
REPORTS, THE REAL PURPOSE IS TO 

1765
00:57:43,459 --> 00:57:45,762
DO X, SO WE CAN'T HAVE Y GOING 

1766
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:47,797
AGAINST X. IF THE LAW SAYS 

1767
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,098
THAT, I WILL APPLY THAT, EVEN 

1768
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:51,067
IF IT RESULTS IN A RESULT THAT 

1769
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:53,403
MIGHT NOT LOOK FAIR OR MIGHT 

1770
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:54,137
NOT LOOK GOOD BECAUSE THAT'S 

1771
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,372
NOT THE ROLE OF A JUDGE TO 

1772
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:56,639
CORRECT. 

1773
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:01,277
THAT'S THE ROLE OF A 

1774
00:58:01,277 --> 00:58:01,844
LEGISLATOR. 

1775
00:58:01,844 --> 00:58:04,647
CERTAINLY TEXTURISM APPLIED TO 

1776
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:05,614
THE CONSTITUTION. 

1777
00:58:05,614 --> 00:58:08,017
BUT YOU'RE INTERPRETING A 200-

1778
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:09,485
YEAR-OLD DOCUMENT RATHER THAN A 

1779
00:58:09,485 --> 00:58:09,819
LAW. 

1780
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,287
YOU'RE LOOKING AT DICTIONARIES 

1781
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:14,557
FROM THE LATE 18th CENTURIES, 

1782
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:16,759
NEWSPAPERS, TRYING TO 

1783
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:18,460
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE TEXT OF THE 

1784
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:20,930
CONSTITUTION, WHAT ITS ORIGINAL 

1785
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:21,363
PUBLIC MEANING IS. 

1786
00:58:21,363 --> 00:58:22,732
WHERE HE STANDS IN THE NEW 

1787
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:25,834
COURT, HE WILL CERTAINLY BE TO 

1788
00:58:25,834 --> 00:58:28,237
THE RIGHT COMFORTABLY ON THE 

1789
00:58:28,237 --> 00:58:28,771
RIGHT SOMEWHERE. 

1790
00:58:28,771 --> 00:58:32,075
I CAN'T EXACTLY SAY ON 

1791
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:33,276
DIFFERENT ISSUES, WHETHER 

1792
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:33,976
CLOSER TO THOMAS OR GORSUCH, 

1793
00:58:33,976 --> 00:58:36,045
BUT TO THE RIGHT OF JOHN 

1794
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:38,747
ROBERTS, WHO WILL NOW 

1795
00:58:38,747 --> 00:58:40,249
DEFINITIVELY BECOME THE MEDIAN 

1796
00:58:40,249 --> 00:58:40,683
VOTE. 

1797
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:41,884
NOT THE SWING VOTE, HE'S NOT 

1798
00:58:41,884 --> 00:58:45,388
GOING TO GO BACK AND FORTH, BUT 

1799
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:45,988
HE WILL DETERMINE EXACTLY HOW 

1800
00:58:45,988 --> 00:58:49,392
FAST AND WHERE THE COURT WILL 

1801
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:50,827
GO WHETHER ON HUGE 

1802
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:52,295
CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES OR OTHER 

1803
00:58:52,295 --> 00:58:53,296
ONES THAT DON'T MAKE THE FRONT 

1804
00:58:53,296 --> 00:58:53,529
PAGES. 

1805
00:58:53,529 --> 00:58:54,864
>> OF COURSE, KAVANAUGH IS 

1806
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:57,100
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SECOND 

1807
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,034
SUPREME COURT NOMINATION 

1808
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,702
FOLLOWING NOW JUSTICE NEIL 

1809
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:00,436
GORSUCH. 

1810
00:59:00,436 --> 00:59:01,603
WHERE ARE THERE SIMILARITIES 

1811
00:59:01,603 --> 00:59:02,472
AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 

1812
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:02,739
TWO? 

1813
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:05,141
>> WELL THEY HAVE BOTH BEEN 

1814
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:06,142
INVOLVED WITH THE FEDERAL 

1815
00:59:06,142 --> 00:59:06,409
SOCIETY. 

1816
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:07,910
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING JOHN 

1817
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:11,381
ROBERTS WAS A PART OF.    

1818
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,883
MEANING THAT FROM A VERY YOUNG 

1819
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:16,085
AGE FROM LAW SCHOOL OR A YOUNG 

1820
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:16,652
LEGAL CAREER AGE, THEY ARE 

1821
00:59:16,652 --> 00:59:19,055
AWARE OF THIS NETWORK OF 

1822
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:19,655
CONSERVATIVES AND LIBERTARIAN 

1823
00:59:19,655 --> 00:59:21,157
LAWYERS AND LAW STUDENTS WHO 

1824
00:59:21,157 --> 00:59:23,259
ARE OUT TO CHANGE THE LEGAL 

1825
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:23,526
CULTURE. 

1826
00:59:23,526 --> 00:59:25,028
LAWYERS BEING PERCEIVED TO BE 

1827
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:27,664
ON THE LEFT IN VARIOUS WAYS. 

1828
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:28,530
HE IS INTELLECTUALLY STEEP IN 

1829
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:28,797
THE LAW. 

1830
00:59:28,797 --> 00:59:30,700
HE IS KNOWN TO AGREE WITH HIM 

1831
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:33,536
OR NOT AS BEING BRILLIANT, 

1832
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:35,371
WRITING OPINIONS THAT ARE OFTEN 

1833
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:37,273
CITED BY THE SUPREME COURT, BY 

1834
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:37,573
ADVOCATES. 

1835
00:59:37,573 --> 00:59:40,510
HE IS ONE OF THESE LOWER COURT 

1836
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:43,612
JUDGES THAT HAS PRESIDENTIAL 

1837
00:59:43,612 --> 00:59:45,848
AUTHORITY, PERSUASIVE 

1838
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:47,083
PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY BEYOND 

1839
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,517
SIMPLY HIS CORRIDOR, DIRECTLY 

1840
00:59:48,517 --> 00:59:51,787
BELOW HIM IN D.C. AND SO AGAIN, 

1841
00:59:51,787 --> 00:59:53,756
THIS IS NOT SOMEONE THAT'S A 

1842
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,793
CIPHER OR THAT HAS COME OUT OF 

1843
00:59:56,793 --> 00:59:57,392
THE WOODWORK, A SURPRISE. 

1844
00:59:57,392 --> 00:59:59,162
IT IS VERY WELL KNOWN AMONG 

1845
00:59:59,162 --> 01:00:00,964
THOSE WHO FOLLOW LEGAL 

1846
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:03,166
DEVELOPMENTS.    

1847
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:05,001
YOU KNOW, MAYBE HE WON'T EXCITE 

1848
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:06,335
THE BASE AS MUCH AS CERTAIN 

1849
01:00:06,335 --> 01:00:07,870
OTHER PEOPLE THAT WERE BEING 

1850
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:08,871
CONSIDERED, BUT AT THE SAME 

1851
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:11,240
TIME THAT MEANS HE DOESN'T HAVE 

1852
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:14,243
QUITE AS MUCH OPPOSITION, YOU 

1853
01:00:14,243 --> 01:00:16,612
KNOW, THEY WILL BE GRASPING AT 

1854
01:00:16,612 --> 01:00:16,979
CERTAIN THINGS. 

1855
01:00:16,979 --> 01:00:17,613
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TRACTION 

1856
01:00:17,613 --> 01:00:20,083
THAT'S GOING TO GET IN THE 

1857
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:20,483
PUBLIC DISCOURSE. 

1858
01:00:20,483 --> 01:00:22,051
>> GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT 

1859
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:24,287
BRETT KAVANAUGH, IS IT LIKELY 

1860
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:27,523
OR EVEN POSSIBLE THAT IF, IN 

1861
01:00:27,523 --> 01:00:29,325
FACT, THE ISSUE OF UPHOLDING OR 

1862
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:33,095
TURNING ROE V. WADE WERE TO 

1863
01:00:33,095 --> 01:00:35,564
COME, HE WOULD VOTE TO OVERTURN 

1864
01:00:35,564 --> 01:00:35,731
IT? 

1865
01:00:35,731 --> 01:00:39,469
>> I DON'T THINK SO. 

1866
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,237
THAT ISSUE, IT WOULD BE STRANGE 

1867
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:44,273
TO HAVE A CASE. 

1868
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:46,342
BUT TYPICALLY YOU WOULD HAVE 

1869
01:00:46,342 --> 01:00:47,376
VARIOUS RESIXTHS, FACING THEM 

1870
01:00:47,376 --> 01:00:49,412
EVERY FIVE YEARS OR SO. 

1871
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:50,747
WHAT YOU'LL SEE ESPECIALLY AS I 

1872
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:53,916
MENTIONED TO BE LED BY THE 

1873
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,618
CHIEF JUSTICE, THE MEDIAN VOTE 

1874
01:00:55,618 --> 01:00:59,856
THAT YOU'LL SEE SOME OF THESE 

1875
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:00,957
RESTRICTIONS STARTING TO BE 

1876
01:01:00,957 --> 01:01:02,090
WITHHELD WITHOUT NEEDING TO 

1877
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:04,460
TOUCH ROE V. WADE OR PLANTED 

1878
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:05,061
PARENTHOOD VERSES CASEY. 

1879
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:07,930
WE TALK ABOUT ROE, BUT CASEY, 

1880
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:09,765
THE 1992 CASE THAT KENNEDY 

1881
01:01:09,765 --> 01:01:11,601
ENGINEERED AND AUTHORED PUT IN 

1882
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:12,734
THIS UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD. 

1883
01:01:12,734 --> 01:01:14,870
WHAT GETS THROUGH OR WHAT 

1884
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:16,105
SURVIVES AN UNDUE BURDEN 

1885
01:01:16,105 --> 01:01:18,674
STANDARD, I THINK NOW IT WILL 

1886
01:01:18,674 --> 01:01:18,907
EXPAND. 

1887
01:01:18,907 --> 01:01:21,110
BUT I THINK WE ARE GENERALLY 

1888
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:23,212
FAR OFF FROM OVERTURNING ROE 

1889
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:23,512
ALTOGETHER. 

1890
01:01:23,512 --> 01:01:25,615
OTHER AREAS OF LAW, IT JUST 

1891
01:01:25,615 --> 01:01:25,882
DEPENDS. 

1892
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:29,217
ALL THIS FOCUS ON ABORTION. 

1893
01:01:29,217 --> 01:01:31,921
BUT FOR EXAMPLE, RACIAL 

1894
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:32,454
PREFERENCES IN EDUCATION 

1895
01:01:32,454 --> 01:01:32,755
ADMISSIONS. 

1896
01:01:32,755 --> 01:01:35,157
THAT'S ONE AREA WHERE I COULD 

1897
01:01:35,157 --> 01:01:38,327
SEE CAVANAUGH BEING THE 

1898
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:39,862
DEFINITIVE VOTE, SAYING THEY 

1899
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,397
VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION TO GET 

1900
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:42,798
RID OF THAT ALTOGETHER. 

1901
01:01:42,798 --> 01:01:45,568
>> ALL RIGHT, JOINING US FROM 

1902
01:01:45,568 --> 01:01:46,035
WASHINGTON. 

1903
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:48,638
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR 

1904
01:01:48,638 --> 01:01:48,971
PERSPECTIVE. 

1905
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:50,072
>>> ALL RIGHT, TO DISCUSS SOME 

1906
01:01:50,072 --> 01:01:51,474
OF THE POLITICAL REACTION TO 

1907
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:52,207
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ANNOUNCEMENT, 

1908
01:01:52,207 --> 01:01:56,746
I WANT TO BRING BACK OUR PANEL 

1909
01:01:56,746 --> 01:02:00,015
OF LESLIE SANCHEZ, CAITLIN HUEY-

1910
01:02:00,015 --> 01:02:00,683
BURNS, AND JILL PAYNE IN 

1911
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:00,983
WASHINGTON. 

1912
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:06,389
LET ME FIRST OF ALL GO TO YOU, 

1913
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:06,622
LESLIE. 

1914
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:08,123
THIS IS AN OBVIOUS CHOICE, SOME 

1915
01:02:08,123 --> 01:02:09,124
ARE SAYING BECAUSE FOR A 

1916
01:02:09,124 --> 01:02:10,525
PRESIDENT WHO HAS MADE IT A 

1917
01:02:10,525 --> 01:02:13,095
POINT TO TRY TO KEEP HIS 

1918
01:02:13,095 --> 01:02:15,831
PROMISES TO THE CONSERVATIVE 

1919
01:02:15,831 --> 01:02:20,737
ELEMENTS OF HIS BASE. 

1920
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:21,971
PLEASE THE INITIAL REACTION, A 

1921
01:02:21,971 --> 01:02:24,207
LOT OF THOSE CONSERVATIVES. 

1922
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:26,608
>> VERY BIG STROKES IN TERMS OF 

1923
01:02:26,608 --> 01:02:30,746
ESTABLISHING SUPPORT AMONG BASE 

1924
01:02:30,746 --> 01:02:31,313
REPUBLICANS, ESTABLISHMENT 

1925
01:02:31,313 --> 01:02:32,047
REPUBLICANS, CONSERVATIVES, A 

1926
01:02:32,047 --> 01:02:33,849
BIT OF A WAY STATION FOR THE 

1927
01:02:33,849 --> 01:02:34,216
SUPREME COURT. 

1928
01:02:34,216 --> 01:02:35,317
HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN TALKED 

1929
01:02:35,317 --> 01:02:36,919
ABOUT, A PART OF THE FEDERALIST 

1930
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:39,388
SOCIETY, WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT 

1931
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:39,655
EARLIER. 

1932
01:02:39,655 --> 01:02:42,991
IT IS REALLY AN INCUBATOR FOR 

1933
01:02:42,991 --> 01:02:46,629
TRAINING, CREDENTIALING, A NEW 

1934
01:02:46,629 --> 01:02:48,631
GENERATION OF YOUNG JURORRISTS 

1935
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:49,331
THAT COULD GO -- JURIST AND 

1936
01:02:49,331 --> 01:02:50,465
LEAVE THE COURT. 

1937
01:02:50,465 --> 01:02:51,367
HE HAS BEEN IN THE PIPELINE FOR 

1938
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:52,268
A VERY LONG TIME. 

1939
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:54,303
THERE IS ONE THING THAT I DO 

1940
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:54,770
POINT UP. 

1941
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:57,607
HE WAS A BIG ARCHITECT AND 

1942
01:02:57,607 --> 01:03:00,276
WRITER IN THE STAR REPORT AND 

1943
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:02,478
OUTLINED 11 GROUNDS FOR CLINTON 

1944
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:03,746
IMPEACHMENT, WHICH COULD BE 

1945
01:03:03,746 --> 01:03:04,113
AWKWARD LATER. 

1946
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:05,348
BUT DEPENDING ON HOW THINGS 

1947
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:07,049
COME OUT IN CONGRESS A FEW 

1948
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:07,817
YEARS FROM NOW. 

1949
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:09,485
BUT IT IS DEFINITELY SOMEONE 

1950
01:03:09,485 --> 01:03:11,454
WHO HAS A WIDE RANGE OF 

1951
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,456
EXPERIENCE THAT REPUBLICANS ARE 

1952
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:13,856
GOING TO FACE. 

1953
01:03:13,856 --> 01:03:15,191
>> CAITLIN, WHAT ARE SOME OF 

1954
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:16,058
THE CHALLENGES YOU THINK 

1955
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:19,028
KAVANAUGH WILL FACE IN A 

1956
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:20,495
CONFIRMATION PROCESS? 

1957
01:03:20,495 --> 01:03:21,998
>> WELL, AS WE HAVE SEEN, 

1958
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:24,800
KAVANAUGH IS ONE OF THE MORE 

1959
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,102
EXPERIENCED MEMBERS OF THOSE 

1960
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:26,702
WHO WERE TALKED ABOUT. 

1961
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:28,404
BUT THAT ALSO MEANS HE HAS A 

1962
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:29,538
LONG PAPER TRAIL. 

1963
01:03:29,538 --> 01:03:32,174
HE ALSO WORKED IN THE WHITE 

1964
01:03:32,174 --> 01:03:32,541
HOUSE. 

1965
01:03:32,541 --> 01:03:33,074
OF COURSE, THE BUSH WHITE 

1966
01:03:33,074 --> 01:03:33,308
HOUSE. 

1967
01:03:33,308 --> 01:03:34,877
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GO 

1968
01:03:34,877 --> 01:03:37,647
THROUGH LOTS AND LOTS OF 

1969
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:40,316
DOCUMENTS AND PAPERS AND 

1970
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:41,683
WRITINGS AND EXCHANGES AND 

1971
01:03:41,683 --> 01:03:42,585
PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THIS 

1972
01:03:42,585 --> 01:03:43,452
PERSON HAS SAID. 

1973
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:44,953
SO THERE IS A LOT FOR PEOPLE TO 

1974
01:03:44,953 --> 01:03:49,158
KIND OF GO THROUGH AND DIGEST. 

1975
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:55,431
YOU ARE ALREADY HERING CHUCK 

1976
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:56,865
SCHUMER KIND OF -- ALREADY WITH 

1977
01:03:56,865 --> 01:03:58,066
CHUCK SCHUMER KIND OF SAYING HE 

1978
01:03:58,066 --> 01:03:59,502
IS GOING TO FIGHT THIS AS MUCH 

1979
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:01,470
AS HE CAN. 

1980
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:05,307
YOU DO SEE REPUBLICANS REALLY 

1981
01:04:05,307 --> 01:04:06,842
SATISFIED WITH THIS PICK. 

1982
01:04:06,842 --> 01:04:08,310
IT RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHAT 

1983
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:09,478
THOSE TWO REPUBLICAN SENATORS 

1984
01:04:09,478 --> 01:04:12,081
THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT, 

1985
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:12,714
MURKOWSKI AND COLLINS, WHETHER 

1986
01:04:12,714 --> 01:04:16,185
THIS IS A PICK THAT IS MORE 

1987
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:18,788
MAINSTREAM IN TERMS OF WHAT 

1988
01:04:18,788 --> 01:04:19,288
THEY ARE LOOKING FOR. 

1989
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:22,124
THAT COULD BE A FACTOR HERE. 

1990
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:23,492
ANOTHER THING TO CONSIDER TOO 

1991
01:04:23,492 --> 01:04:27,229
IS THAT BECAUSE HE WAS INVOLVED 

1992
01:04:27,229 --> 01:04:29,498
IN THE STAR DECISION, HE HAS 

1993
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:31,834
ALSO MADE COMMENTS DURING THAT, 

1994
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:34,036
THAT A PRESIDENT SHOULDN'T BE, 

1995
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:36,839
YOU KNOW, HAVE TO BE INVOLVED 

1996
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:39,041
IN -- HE HAS PRESIDENTIAL 

1997
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:41,310
POWERS THAT COULD INOCULATE HIM 

1998
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:41,877
FROM THESE INVESTIGATIONS, 

1999
01:04:41,877 --> 01:04:45,882
WHICH I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO 

2000
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:51,120
HEAR QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT 

2001
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,154
PARTICULARLY FROM SENATORS LIKE 

2002
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:53,389
CORY BOOKER WHO SAID WE 

2003
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:54,857
SHOULDN'T CONSIDER THE 

2004
01:04:54,857 --> 01:04:55,657
PRESIDENT'S PICK UNTIL THE 

2005
01:04:55,657 --> 01:04:56,726
MUELLER INVESTIGATION WRAPS UP. 

2006
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,227
NOT THAT IT IS REALISTIC, BUT I 

2007
01:04:58,227 --> 01:04:59,395
THINK IT WILL BE ALONG THE 

2008
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:01,030
LINES OF WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO 

2009
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:02,031
HEAR. 

2010
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:02,598
>> YEAH, WHAT ABOUT THAT? 

2011
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:03,899
THE NOTION THAT YOU DO HAVE 

2012
01:05:03,899 --> 01:05:06,269
QUITE THE RECORD HERE FOR 

2013
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:07,636
DEMOCRATS WHO ARE GOING TO TRY 

2014
01:05:07,636 --> 01:05:10,940
TO SLOW DOWN PRESUMABLY THIS 

2015
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:11,407
CONFIRMATION PROCESS. 

2016
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:13,942
THEY HAVE A LOT TO GO THROUGH.  

2017
01:05:14,009 --> 01:05:15,677
>> THEY DO HAVE A LOT TO GO 

2018
01:05:15,677 --> 01:05:15,944
THROUGH. 

2019
01:05:15,944 --> 01:05:17,413
THERE IS QUITE THE PAPER TRAIL 

2020
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:18,513
ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

2021
01:05:18,513 --> 01:05:20,415
YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU'RE ALREADY 

2022
01:05:20,415 --> 01:05:21,150
SAYING, DEMOCRATS ARE WASTING 

2023
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:24,086
NO TIME IN LAYING OUT THE 

2024
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:24,419
MARKERS HERE. 

2025
01:05:24,419 --> 01:05:26,022
CHUCK SCHUMER'S STATEMENT WAS 

2026
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:28,657
OUT ABOUT TEN SECONDS AFTER 

2027
01:05:28,657 --> 01:05:29,592
DONALD TRUMP SAID BRETT 

2028
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:30,826
AND HE WAS VERY CLEAR WHAT THE %

2029
01:05:30,826 --> 01:05:32,027
MARKER WAS GOING TO BE. 

2030
01:05:32,027 --> 01:05:33,562
IT WAS GOING TO BE ABOUT 

2031
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:35,264
WOMEN'S HEALTH, IT WAS GOING TO 

2032
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:36,465
BE ABOUT HEALTH CARE, IT IS 

2033
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:37,933
GOING TO BE ABOUT EXECUTIVE 

2034
01:05:37,933 --> 01:05:38,233
PRIVILEGE. 

2035
01:05:38,233 --> 01:05:39,268
I THINK ALSO SOMETHING 

2036
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:40,369
DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO PUSH ON 

2037
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:44,173
HERE, THEY ARE GOING TO TALK 

2038
01:05:44,173 --> 01:05:45,408
ABOUT A RECENT OPINION THAT 

2039
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:46,241
JUDGE KAVANAUGH WROTE ABOUT A 

2040
01:05:46,241 --> 01:05:49,211
YOUNG GIRL WHO WAS HELD AT THE 

2041
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:51,080
BORDER FROM A MIGRANT FAMILY 

2042
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:51,647
AND RIGHTS INVOLVING THAT. 

2043
01:05:51,647 --> 01:05:53,649
I THINK THERE IS A LOT HERE FOR 

2044
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:54,617
DEMOCRATS TO PICK THROUGH. 

2045
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:55,750
I WILL SAY THIS, THE PRESIDENT 

2046
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:59,388
COULD HAVE GONE FOR A FULL-ON 

2047
01:05:59,388 --> 01:06:02,157
CULTURE WAR, PICKING SOMEONE 

2048
01:06:02,157 --> 01:06:03,693
LIKE AMY CONEY BARRETT, THAT 

2049
01:06:03,693 --> 01:06:05,928
WOULD HAVE BEEN SIGNALING 

2050
01:06:05,928 --> 01:06:06,628
YOU'RE READY TO FIGHT. 

2051
01:06:06,628 --> 01:06:08,631
THIS SIGNALS I'M READY TO 

2052
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:11,600
FIGHT, BUT I'M TRYING TO BE 

2053
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,235
GOVERNOR HERE. 

2054
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:13,735
THAT'S INTERESTING, AN 

2055
01:06:13,735 --> 01:06:15,337
INTERESTING SIGNALING TO SENATE 

2056
01:06:15,337 --> 01:06:15,671
REPUBLICANS. 

2057
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:16,872
MITCH MCCONNELL IS NOT AS HAPPY 

2058
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:20,709
AS HE COULD BE WITH THIS 

2059
01:06:20,709 --> 01:06:22,011
CHOICE, BUT HE IS HAPPIER THAN 

2060
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:25,047
SOMEONE LIKE AMY CONEY BARRETT. 

2061
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:26,649
>> THE NOTION THAT AS JOE 

2062
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:27,983
POINTS OUT, THE POTENTIAL FROM 

2063
01:06:27,983 --> 01:06:30,986
A STRATEGIC POINT OF VIEW TO 

2064
01:06:30,986 --> 01:06:32,955
SORT OF ADD FUEL TO THIS 

2065
01:06:32,955 --> 01:06:33,989
ALREADY VERY, VERY HEATED 

2066
01:06:33,989 --> 01:06:37,960
CULTURE WAR THAT HAS BEEN 

2067
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:38,293
TAKING PLACE. 

2068
01:06:38,293 --> 01:06:39,528
SO IN SOME RESPECT, SOME 

2069
01:06:39,528 --> 01:06:40,462
REPUBLICANS MUST BE BREATHING A 

2070
01:06:40,462 --> 01:06:41,997
SIGH OF RELIEF? 

2071
01:06:41,997 --> 01:06:42,431
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

2072
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:44,300
I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS 

2073
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:45,668
REALLY GIVEN A PASS TO 

2074
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:47,369
REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE BY 

2075
01:06:47,369 --> 01:06:49,904
HANDING THEM A LONG-TIME 

2076
01:06:49,904 --> 01:06:53,075
WASHINGTON INSIDER, WHICH IS IN 

2077
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:55,477
SOME WAYS IN CONTRACT TO HIS 

2078
01:06:55,477 --> 01:06:55,744
CAMPAIGN. 

2079
01:06:55,744 --> 01:06:59,248
REALLY, I THINK YOU SHOULDN'T 

2080
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:01,917
DO A CONSERVE, BATTLE AT THE 

2081
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:03,052
TIME YOU PICKED REPUBLICNS, 

2082
01:07:03,052 --> 01:07:04,519
POTENTIALLY NOT HAVING ENOUGH 

2083
01:07:04,519 --> 01:07:05,787
VOTES TO CONFIRM SOMEONE WHO 

2084
01:07:05,787 --> 01:07:08,090
PERHAPS WOULD BE MORE OF A 

2085
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:08,557
CONTROVERSIAL PICK. 

2086
01:07:08,557 --> 01:07:10,625
SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO CAUSE A 

2087
01:07:10,625 --> 01:07:11,894
HUGE DEBATE, FOR EXAMPLE, OVER 

2088
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:12,227
ROE V. WADE. 

2089
01:07:12,227 --> 01:07:13,362
THERE ISN'T MUCH OF A PAPER 

2090
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:15,630
TRAIL AS WE HAVE SAID ON ROE V. 

2091
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:15,965
WADE. 

2092
01:07:15,965 --> 01:07:17,099
FOR SOMEONE LIKE KAVANAUGH, HE 

2093
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:19,301
SAID IN THE PAST HE CONSIDERS 

2094
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:19,801
IT BINDING PRECEDENT. 

2095
01:07:19,801 --> 01:07:22,071
BUT THAT'S WHEN HE WAS BEING 

2096
01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:24,440
CONSIDERED FOR THE CIRCUIT 

2097
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,208
COURT OF APPEALS. 

2098
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:28,944
YOU TO FOLLOW THE PRECEDENCE 

2099
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:37,686
SET BY THE SUPREME COURT. 

2100
01:07:37,686 --> 01:07:39,888
HE IS SUPPORTED BY THE BUSINESS 

2101
01:07:39,888 --> 01:07:41,690
COMMUNITY AS WELL. 

2102
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:42,691
HE IS OFFERING OPINIONS RAINING 

2103
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:47,930
IN SOME OF THE OBAMA ERA IN THE 

2104
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:48,964
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS, 

2105
01:07:48,964 --> 01:07:50,265
GOING AFTER THE CONSUMER 

2106
01:07:50,265 --> 01:07:51,200
PROTECTION BUREAU, COMING OUT. 

2107
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,369
AND I THINK HE IS SOMEONE THAT 

2108
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:55,137
A LOT OF REPUBLICANS WOULD FEEL 

2109
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:56,705
AS IF FAIRLY IT IS A SAFE PICK. 

2110
01:07:56,705 --> 01:07:58,540
OF COURSE, AS WE SAID, WE WILL 

2111
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:00,676
SEE WHAT ISSUES DEMOCRATS WILL 

2112
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:00,976
HIGHLIGHT. 

2113
01:08:00,976 --> 01:08:02,344
I DO THINK THEY WILL NEED TO GO 

2114
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:04,780
OVER THIS IDEA THAT THE 

2115
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:05,280
PRESIDENT HAS ABSOLUTE 

2116
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:05,881
DISCRETION WHEN IT COMES TO 

2117
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:07,316
WHETHER OR NOT THEY NEED TO 

2118
01:08:07,316 --> 01:08:09,318
APPOINT OR FIRE A SPECIAL 

2119
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:11,187
COUNCIL WITH ALL THE ATTENTION 

2120
01:08:11,187 --> 01:08:12,454
INTO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND 

2121
01:08:12,454 --> 01:08:12,688
MOSCOW. 

2122
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:13,889
THAT MIGHT BE ONE OF THE ISSUES 

2123
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:15,624
THAT THEY WILL NEED TO SHOW 

2124
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:15,824
YOU. 

2125
01:08:15,824 --> 01:08:17,392
>> AND THEY WANT TO PLACE WHAT 

2126
01:08:17,392 --> 01:08:19,828
THEY HAVE SAID ABOUT HIS 

2127
01:08:19,828 --> 01:08:20,295
JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY. 

2128
01:08:20,295 --> 01:08:22,031
LET'S LISTEN TO THAT.   

2129
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:28,770
>> I HAVE SERVED WITH 17 OTHER 

2130
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:29,004
JUDGES. 

2131
01:08:29,004 --> 01:08:31,473
EACH OF THEM A COLLEAGUE AND A 

2132
01:08:31,473 --> 01:08:31,707
FRIEND. 

2133
01:08:31,707 --> 01:08:33,876
IT IS STRAIGHTFORWARD. 

2134
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:35,711
A JUDGE MUST BE INDEPENDENT AND 

2135
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,944
MUST INTERPRET THE LAW NOT MAKE 

2136
01:08:36,944 --> 01:08:40,582
THE LAW.    

2137
01:08:40,582 --> 01:08:41,716
A JUDGE MUST INTERPRET STATUTES 

2138
01:08:41,716 --> 01:08:42,017
AS WRITTEN. 

2139
01:08:42,017 --> 01:08:45,453
AND A JUDGE MUST INTERPRET THE 

2140
01:08:45,453 --> 01:08:48,424
CONSTITUTION AS WRITTEN. 

2141
01:08:48,424 --> 01:08:53,328
INFORMED BY HISTORY AND 

2142
01:08:53,328 --> 01:08:54,729
TRADITION AND PRECEDENT. 

2143
01:08:54,729 --> 01:08:56,332
>> LESLIE, IF YOU ARE MITCH 

2144
01:08:56,332 --> 01:08:57,899
MCCONNELL NOW AND YOU'RE 

2145
01:08:57,899 --> 01:08:59,734
THINKING ABOUT A CONFIRMATION 

2146
01:08:59,734 --> 01:09:01,069
PROCESS AND YOU LOOK AT BRETT 

2147
01:09:01,069 --> 01:09:02,738
KAVANAUGH, WHAT ARE YOU 

2148
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:03,305
THINKING RIGHT NOW? 

2149
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:04,506
>> HE WASN'T ONE OF THE TOP TWO 

2150
01:09:04,506 --> 01:09:07,276
THAT WOULD BE THE SAFEST PICKS 

2151
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:07,609
OVERALL. 

2152
01:09:07,609 --> 01:09:09,277
NOW YOU HAVE OVER 300 OPINIONS. 

2153
01:09:09,277 --> 01:09:12,948
THAT IS A LOT OF WORK AND DEPTH 

2154
01:09:12,948 --> 01:09:14,817
TO THIS IN TERMS OF NAVIGATING 

2155
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:15,818
IT THROUGH THE SENATE. 

2156
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,986
BUT I THINK IT IS EXTREMELY 

2157
01:09:17,986 --> 01:09:18,252
POSITIVE. 

2158
01:09:18,252 --> 01:09:20,022
HE KNOWS HOW TO DO THIS. 

2159
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:22,024
HE HAS HANDLED THESE POLITICAL 

2160
01:09:22,024 --> 01:09:22,390
BATTLES BEFORE. 

2161
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:24,259
HE IS EXACTLY THE RIGHT, HE HAS 

2162
01:09:24,259 --> 01:09:26,694
THE RIGHT CALIBER AND ENOUGH ON 

2163
01:09:26,694 --> 01:09:27,462
THE POSITIVES TO NAVIGATE SOME 

2164
01:09:27,462 --> 01:09:28,497
OF THESE NEGATIVES THAT YOU'RE 

2165
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:29,765
GOING TO SEE. 

2166
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:31,634
THOSE NEGATIVES THOUGH, SOME OF 

2167
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:34,636
THE AMNESTY STORIES WE WILL 

2168
01:09:34,636 --> 01:09:42,877
HEAR ABOUT, YOU KNOW, SOME OF 

2169
01:09:42,877 --> 01:09:51,086
THESE HOT ISSUES. 

2170
01:09:51,086 --> 01:09:53,854
>> WHAT ABOUT THAT CAITLIN. 

2171
01:09:53,854 --> 01:09:58,027
WE KNOW MCCONNELL HAS SORT OF 

2172
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:58,661
BEEN MASTERED. 

2173
01:09:58,661 --> 01:10:00,195
WE KNOW THAT FORMER SENATORS 

2174
01:10:00,195 --> 01:10:02,030
WILL BE THE SHERPA NOW GUIDING 

2175
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:04,633
BRETT KAVANAUGH THROUGH THAT 

2176
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:06,101
CONFIRMATION PROCESS AND 

2177
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:07,403
MEETING WITH LAWMAKERS, FOR 

2178
01:10:07,403 --> 01:10:08,103
INSTANCE, ON CAPITOL HILL. 

2179
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:10,939
BUT WHEN YOU ARE CONSIDERING 

2180
01:10:10,939 --> 01:10:12,741
STATEMENTS LIKE THOSE FROM 

2181
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:14,510
SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS OR LISA 

2182
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:15,777
MURKOWSKI, WITH THIS PICK OF 

2183
01:10:15,777 --> 01:10:17,379
BRETT KAVANAUGH, ARE YOU 

2184
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:18,380
FEELING A LITTLE BIT BETTER NOW 

2185
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:20,282
IF YOU ARE MITCH MCCONNELL? 

2186
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:21,784
>> IF YOU ARE MITCH MCCONNELL, 

2187
01:10:21,784 --> 01:10:23,852
I THINK SO, ALTHOUGH THERE IS 

2188
01:10:23,852 --> 01:10:25,354
THAT UNCERTAINTY OF WHAT YOU 

2189
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:29,224
CAN PICK APART FROM THOSE 

2190
01:10:29,224 --> 01:10:30,159
HUNDREDS OF DECISIONS, 

2191
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:31,226
EVERYTHING ESSENTIALLY THAT HE 

2192
01:10:31,226 --> 01:10:33,095
HAS WRITTEN WHILE ON THE BENCH. 

2193
01:10:33,095 --> 01:10:35,431
SO SINCE THERE IS A LOT TO GO 

2194
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:37,532
TO, I THINK UNCERTAINTY IS 

2195
01:10:37,532 --> 01:10:37,866
STILL THERE. 

2196
01:10:37,866 --> 01:10:39,335
HOWEVER WITH THIS PICK 

2197
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:41,870
ESPECIALLY OPPOSED TO, YOU 

2198
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:43,238
KNOW, ANITA KUMAR, OR -- AMY 

2199
01:10:43,238 --> 01:10:44,907
CONEY BARRETT OR MAYBE SOME 

2200
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:47,509
OTHERS, THIS IS MORE OF AN 

2201
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:48,544
ESTABLISHMENT-ORIENTED PICK.  

2202
01:10:48,544 --> 01:10:49,711
SO I THINK ANOTHER THING YOU 

2203
01:10:49,711 --> 01:10:52,715
HAVE TO CONSIDER IS THAT WHILE 

2204
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:54,883
REPUBLICANS DO HAVE REAL 

2205
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:55,951
DISAGREEMENTS WITH THIS 

2206
01:10:55,951 --> 01:10:57,118
PRESIDENT ON ISSUES LIKE TRADE, 

2207
01:10:57,118 --> 01:10:59,154
BUT ALSO ON HIS BEHAVIOR, HIS 

2208
01:10:59,154 --> 01:11:01,457
STYLE, AND HIS RHETORIC, THEY 

2209
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:02,758
ARE REPUBLICANS AT THE END OF 

2210
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:04,026
THE DAY.  

2211
01:11:04,026 --> 01:11:05,527
YOU KNOW, JEFF FLAKE IS A GOOD 

2212
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:07,896
EXAMPLE OF THIS AND SOME 

2213
01:11:07,896 --> 01:11:08,096
OTHERS. 

2214
01:11:08,096 --> 01:11:09,698
úTHEY EVENTUALLY DO WAN 

2215
01:11:09,698 --> 01:11:13,636
TO YES ON THIS PICK BECAUSE 

2216
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:14,636
THIS PICK, IT IS ESPECIALLY IN 

2217
01:11:14,636 --> 01:11:16,805
CAVANAUGH SEEN AS KIND OF A 

2218
01:11:16,805 --> 01:11:17,973
TRADITIONAL CONSERVATIVE PICK. 

2219
01:11:17,973 --> 01:11:19,742
SO I THINK THAT IS ALSO HOW WE 

2220
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:21,243
NEED TO LOOK AT THIS. 

2221
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:23,279
THAT IS WHY A LOT OF THESE 

2222
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:24,813
DEMOCRATS WILL BE WAITING TO 

2223
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:27,283
SEE WHAT THESE REPUBLICANS DO. 

2224
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:28,984
IF REPUBLICANS COULD KEEP 

2225
01:11:28,984 --> 01:11:31,653
TOGETHER AS A COHESIVE UNIT AND 

2226
01:11:31,653 --> 01:11:33,288
VOTE IN SUPPORT OF CAVANAUGH, 

2227
01:11:33,288 --> 01:11:34,890
THEN YOU MIGHT SEE THAT GIVE 

2228
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:37,993
LICENSE TO A COUPLE OF 

2229
01:11:37,993 --> 01:11:39,928
DEMOCRATS TO CROSS OVER.    

2230
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:41,797
AND IF THEY DON'T DO THAT, THEN 

2231
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:44,132
I THINK THAT WILL ALSO WORK TO 

2232
01:11:44,132 --> 01:11:44,666
THEIR ADVANTAGE. 

2233
01:11:44,666 --> 01:11:48,070
>> I WANT TO PUT UP A TWEET 

2234
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:51,239
FROM A DEMOCRAT, SENATOR DOUG 

2235
01:11:51,239 --> 01:11:51,807
JONES. 

2236
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,475
THIS IS THE STATEMENT FROM THE 

2237
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:55,710
SENATOR THERE FROM ALABAMA. 

2238
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:57,646
TONIGHT'S ANNOUNCEMENT IS ONLY 

2239
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:59,047
A FIRST STEP, A AUTHOR 

2240
01:11:59,047 --> 01:12:00,382
REVETTING OF HIS BODY OF WORK 

2241
01:12:00,382 --> 01:12:01,950
WILL BE CRITICAL FOR THE SENATE 

2242
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:02,951
TO FULFILL THE SHARE 

2243
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:04,286
RESPONSIBILITY, WHICH I TAKE 

2244
01:12:04,286 --> 01:12:04,686
VERY SERIOUSLY. 

2245
01:12:04,686 --> 01:12:07,289
AND I WILL BE DILIGENT IN 

2246
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:09,525
MEASURING THE RECORD AND 

2247
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:10,092
UNDERTAKING THE INDEPENDENT 

2248
01:12:10,092 --> 01:12:10,325
REVIEW. 

2249
01:12:10,325 --> 01:12:12,427
WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THROUGHOUT 

2250
01:12:12,427 --> 01:12:14,262
THE NIGHT, THE NOTION OF 

2251
01:12:14,262 --> 01:12:16,064
DEMOCRATS WHO FIND THEMSELVES 

2252
01:12:16,064 --> 01:12:17,466
IN THESE POSITIONS WHERE THEY 

2253
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:19,334
ARE IN THESE RED STATES, BUT 

2254
01:12:19,334 --> 01:12:21,537
REALLY WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSING ON 

2255
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:24,873
HEIDI HEITKAMP AND JOE 

2256
01:12:24,873 --> 01:12:25,140
DONNELLY. 

2257
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:26,475
JOE MANCHIN, I HAVEN'T YET SEEN 

2258
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:27,643
WHAT KIND OF STATEMENTS THEY 

2259
01:12:27,643 --> 01:12:29,344
HAVE PUT OUT, BUT WE KNOW THEY 

2260
01:12:29,344 --> 01:12:31,013
HAVE DECLINED THAT INVITATION 

2261
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:33,682
TO BE THERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE 

2262
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:34,182
FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. 

2263
01:12:34,182 --> 01:12:36,418
NOW WITH THIS PICK OF BRETT 

2264
01:12:36,418 --> 01:12:38,287
KAVANAUGH AND SO MUCH OF A 

2265
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:41,423
RECORD TO GO THROUGH, IS THERE 

2266
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:45,928
NOW PERHAPS HOPE THEY WILL BE 

2267
01:12:45,928 --> 01:12:47,295
ABLE TO FIND SOMETHING WITHIN 

2268
01:12:47,295 --> 01:12:49,498
THAT RECORD THAT THEY WILL BE 

2269
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:52,701
ABLE TO TEASE OUT ON THE 

2270
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:54,870
ISSUES, MAYBE HANG A POSITION 

2271
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:55,738
OF OPPOSITION, SO THEY WOULD BE 

2272
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:58,040
ABLE TO SAY WHEN IT COMES TO, 

2273
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,041
FOR INSTANCE, JOE MANCHIN, IN A 

2274
01:13:00,041 --> 01:13:00,942
PREEXISTING CONDITION, RIGHT, 

2275
01:13:00,942 --> 01:13:01,944
THE ISSUE OF HEALTH CARE. 

2276
01:13:01,944 --> 01:13:03,879
SOME OF THE RULINGS THAT THEY 

2277
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:06,415
HAVE SEEN WOULD GIVE HIM PAUSE, 

2278
01:13:06,415 --> 01:13:08,917
SO THEY HAVE A MESSAGE THAT, 

2279
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:11,153
YOU KNOW, RED STATE, EVEN AS A 

2280
01:13:11,153 --> 01:13:12,421
DEMOCRAT, THEY FEEL THEY WILL 

2281
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:14,690
BE ABLE TO STILL CONNECT WITH 

2282
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:14,923
VOTERS. 

2283
01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:15,791
>> I THINK QUITE POSSIBLY A LOT 

2284
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:19,194
OF IT IS GOING TO HAVE TO DO 

2285
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:21,196
MORE WITH THE WORKERS' RIGHTS, 

2286
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:22,698
HEALTH CARE, SOME OF THOSE 

2287
01:13:22,698 --> 01:13:24,432
ECONOMIC ISSUES FOR DEMOCRATS 

2288
01:13:24,432 --> 01:13:27,836
WHO ARE IN RED STATES. 

2289
01:13:27,836 --> 01:13:33,508
THEY WILL NOT WIN THE PUBLIC 

2290
01:13:33,508 --> 01:13:33,742
ISSUES. 

2291
01:13:33,742 --> 01:13:35,844
I THINK THAT'S WHERE IT MIGHT 

2292
01:13:35,844 --> 01:13:37,980
BE THE DIFFERENCING IMEMPLOYED 

2293
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:38,947
BY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. 

2294
01:13:38,947 --> 01:13:41,149
BECAUSE HE IS SOMEONE WHO 

2295
01:13:41,149 --> 01:13:43,385
SERVED WITHIN THE BUSH 

2296
01:13:43,385 --> 01:13:45,888
ADMINISTRATION, THERE MIGHT BE 

2297
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:49,792
PERHAPS REIT GAITING OF THE 

2298
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:52,261
ERA, THE POST SEVEN ERROR, THE 

2299
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:54,029
QUESTION OF THE ROLE TO WHAT 

2300
01:13:54,029 --> 01:13:56,832
EXTENT WAS HE INVOLVED WITH, 

2301
01:13:56,832 --> 01:13:57,366
PERHAPS DEFENDING THE 

2302
01:13:57,366 --> 01:13:59,568
NOMINATION AT THE TIME. 

2303
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:01,670
THAT CAME UP TO THE JUDICIARY. 

2304
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:02,771
YOU KNOW, WHETHER OR NOT THAT A 

2305
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:04,940
LOT OF THOSE SAME ISSUES WILL 

2306
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,441
BE REIT GAITED NOW REMAINS TO 

2307
01:14:06,441 --> 01:14:06,942
BE SEEN. 

2308
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:09,410
BUT I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS 

2309
01:14:09,410 --> 01:14:11,146
HE IS SOLIDLY CONSERVATIVE. 

2310
01:14:11,146 --> 01:14:13,815
SOME OF THE LEGAL SCHOLARS AND 

2311
01:14:13,815 --> 01:14:15,384
POLITICAL SCIENTISTS WHO KEEP A 

2312
01:14:15,384 --> 01:14:21,556
SCORE OF THOSE WHO SIT IN THE 

2313
01:14:21,556 --> 01:14:22,591
JUDICIARY HAVE THEY WOULD FALL 

2314
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:25,126
WELL TO THE RIGHT OF ANTHONY 

2315
01:14:25,126 --> 01:14:26,361
KENNEDY.  

2316
01:14:26,361 --> 01:14:30,431
HE WOULD BE A CONSERVATIVE 

2317
01:14:30,431 --> 01:14:31,633
SECOND TO JUSTICE CLEARANCE 

2318
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:31,866
THOMAS. 

2319
01:14:31,866 --> 01:14:34,503
SO I THINK THAT HE HAS A 

2320
01:14:34,503 --> 01:14:35,103
FUNDAMENTALLY CONSERVATIVE 

2321
01:14:35,103 --> 01:14:35,870
RECORD, WHERE DEMOCRATS WILL BE 

2322
01:14:35,870 --> 01:14:36,771
ABLE TO TEASE OUT SOMETHING IF 

2323
01:14:36,771 --> 01:14:38,540
THEY WANT TO STAND IN 

2324
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:38,840
OPPOSITION. 

2325
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,008
PERHAPS THERE IS A LITTLE BIT 

2326
01:14:40,008 --> 01:14:41,410
LESS PRESSURE ON DEMOCRATS IF 

2327
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:45,881
THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY ARE 

2328
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:47,982
THE DECISIVE VOICE. 

2329
01:14:47,982 --> 01:14:50,452
BRETT KAVANAUGH SEEMS LESS OF A 

2330
01:14:50,452 --> 01:14:50,885
CONTROVERSIAL PICK. 

2331
01:14:50,885 --> 01:14:52,421
GIVING A LITTLE BIT OF COVER TO 

2332
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:53,121
THOSE DEMOCRATS WHO DON'T WANT 

2333
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:55,190
TO BE SEEN AS THE DECIDING 

2334
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:55,390
VOTE. 

2335
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:56,959
>> AS YOU HAVE BEEN SPEAKING, I 

2336
01:14:56,959 --> 01:14:59,328
HAVE BEEN HANDED A STATEMENT 

2337
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:01,196
HERE FROM JOE MANCHIN, DEMOCRAT 

2338
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:01,596
OF WEST VIRGINIA. 

2339
01:15:01,596 --> 01:15:08,436
IT READS IN PART, , I HAVE A 

2340
01:15:08,436 --> 01:15:09,905
CONSTITUTION OBLIGATION TO 

2341
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:11,039
FULFILL SUPREME COURT 

2342
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:11,339
VACANCIES. 

2343
01:15:11,339 --> 01:15:12,507
I TAKE THAT RESPONSIBILITY 

2344
01:15:12,507 --> 01:15:12,807
SERIOUSLY. 

2345
01:15:12,807 --> 01:15:15,176
IT GOES ON TO SAY THE SUPREME 

2346
01:15:15,176 --> 01:15:17,880
COURT WILL ULTIMATELY DECIDE IF 

2347
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,514
NEARLY00,000 WEST VIRGINIANS 

2348
01:15:19,514 --> 01:15:21,049
WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS 

2349
01:15:21,049 --> 01:15:22,951
WILL LOSE THEIR HEALTH CARE. 

2350
01:15:22,951 --> 01:15:24,352
THIS DECISION WILL DIRECTLY 

2351
01:15:24,352 --> 01:15:25,921
IMPACT ALMOST 40% OF MY STATE, 

2352
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:29,224
SO I'M VERY INTERESTED IN HIS 

2353
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:31,993
POSITION ON PROTECTING WEST 

2354
01:15:31,993 --> 01:15:32,627
VIRGINIA'S PREEXISTING 

2355
01:15:32,627 --> 01:15:32,927
CONDITIONS. 

2356
01:15:32,927 --> 01:15:34,396
SO JOEL, THE QUESTION TO YOU 

2357
01:15:34,396 --> 01:15:37,933
NOW IS WE ARE ALREADY SEEING, 

2358
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:39,568
WHAT WOULD SEEM LIKE THE 

2359
01:15:39,568 --> 01:15:41,470
FORMULATION OF A STRATEGY FOR 

2360
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:42,371
THOSE DEMOCRATS WHO ARE IN 

2361
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:45,073
THOSE RED STATES AS THEY TRY TO 

2362
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:47,275
FIGURE OUT HOW IT IS THEY WILL 

2363
01:15:47,275 --> 01:15:48,944
APPROACH THIS PARTICULAR 

2364
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:49,344
NOMINATION. 

2365
01:15:49,344 --> 01:15:53,315
>> HARD IS THE SAFE GROUND FOR 

2366
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:57,919
JOE MANCHIN TO BE ON. 

2367
01:15:57,919 --> 01:15:59,421
THAT'S WHERE THIS IS GOING TO 

2368
01:15:59,421 --> 01:15:59,588
BE. 

2369
01:15:59,588 --> 01:16:00,989
I DO THINK YOU ARE STILL GOING 

2370
01:16:00,989 --> 01:16:03,058
TO SEE PEOPLE LIKE JOE MANCHIN 

2371
01:16:03,058 --> 01:16:03,258
WAIT. 

2372
01:16:03,258 --> 01:16:04,526
THEY ARE GOING TO WAIT TO SEE 

2373
01:16:04,526 --> 01:16:07,428
WHAT HAPPENS WITH SUSAN COLLINS 

2374
01:16:07,428 --> 01:16:08,430
AND LISA MURKOWSKI. 

2375
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:09,631
THAT'S THE GROUND THEY FEEL 

2376
01:16:09,631 --> 01:16:10,499
SAFE ON PUSHING BACK. 

2377
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:11,933
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HEAR JOE 

2378
01:16:11,933 --> 01:16:13,735
MANCHIN TALKING ABOUT A WOMAN'S 

2379
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:13,968
RIGHT. 

2380
01:16:13,968 --> 01:16:14,903
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HEAR HIM 

2381
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:15,904
TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER 

2382
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:18,139
ISSUES THAT DON'T MATTER TO HIS 

2383
01:16:18,139 --> 01:16:18,373
STATE. 

2384
01:16:18,373 --> 01:16:20,175
HE IS SOMEBODY WHO UNDERSTANDS 

2385
01:16:20,175 --> 01:16:21,777
HOME STATE POLITICS BETTER THAN 

2386
01:16:21,777 --> 01:16:24,512
ANYONE IN THE DEMOCRATIC 

2387
01:16:24,512 --> 01:16:24,712
CAUCUS. 

2388
01:16:24,712 --> 01:16:25,714
úTHAT'S WHAT HE WILL DO 

2389
01:16:25,714 --> 01:16:28,316
ONE OF MY FAVORITE QUOTES I 

2390
01:16:28,316 --> 01:16:29,117
HAVE HEARD TONIGHT, ELAINE, AN 

2391
01:16:29,117 --> 01:16:32,554
OLD QUOTE FROM DICK DURBIN WHO 

2392
01:16:32,554 --> 01:16:35,523
CALLED BRETT KAVANAUGH THE 

2393
01:16:35,523 --> 01:16:38,326
FORREST GOMP OF POLITICS. 

2394
01:16:38,326 --> 01:16:40,262
HE HAS ESSENTIALLY BEEN THERE 

2395
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:41,930
IN EVERY WATER SHED MOMENT OVER 

2396
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:43,432
THE LAST 20 YEARS. 

2397
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:45,200
GO BACK TO BUSH V GORE, WHITE 

2398
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,734
WATER, NOW YOU LOOK HERE IN THE 

2399
01:16:46,734 --> 01:16:50,071
2000s THAT SOME OF THE VERY 

2400
01:16:50,071 --> 01:16:51,306
CONSEQUENTIAL CASES HAVE COME 

2401
01:16:51,306 --> 01:16:51,473
UP. 

2402
01:16:51,473 --> 01:16:52,874
I THINK THAT'S A VERY 

2403
01:16:52,874 --> 01:16:55,043
INTERESTING FRAMING AROUND 

2404
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:55,443
BRETT KAVANAUGH. 

2405
01:16:55,443 --> 01:16:56,644
ACTUALLY CHUCK SCHUMER IN A 

2406
01:16:56,644 --> 01:16:57,612
PREVIOUS NOMINATION HEARING 

2407
01:16:57,612 --> 01:16:59,381
SAID THAT IT IS SALT IN THE 

2408
01:16:59,381 --> 01:17:00,716
WOUND FOR THE DEMOCRATIC BASE 

2409
01:17:00,716 --> 01:17:04,286
TO HAVE SOMEBODY LIKE THIS THAT 

2410
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:04,786
THEY HAVE TO CONSIDER. 

2411
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:06,321
SO AGAIN, THESE ARE ALL OF THE 

2412
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:07,456
OLD STATEMENTS AND QUOTES THAT 

2413
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:08,390
WILL COME UP AND THEY WILL 

2414
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:11,092
BECOME A PART OF THE DISCUSSION 

2415
01:17:11,092 --> 01:17:11,292
HERE. 

2416
01:17:11,292 --> 01:17:12,794
I'M VERY INTERESTED TO SEE HOW 

2417
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:15,197
THAT WILL PLAY OUT. 

2418
01:17:15,197 --> 01:17:16,564
>> LESLIE, SABRINA, CAITLIN, 

2419
01:17:16,564 --> 01:17:18,066
JOEL, THANKS TO YOU ALL. 

2420
01:17:18,066 --> 01:17:19,668
>>> JOINING ME NOW IN 

2421
01:17:19,668 --> 01:17:22,003
WASHINGTON IS CBS NEWS 

2422
01:17:22,003 --> 01:17:23,271
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ED 

2423
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:23,538
O'KEEFE. 

2424
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:25,540
SO ED, WHAT DO YOU THINK THE 

2425
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:27,475
BIGGEST OBSTACLES WILL BE HERE 

2426
01:17:27,475 --> 01:17:31,613
FOR KAVANAUGH IN GETTING 

2427
01:17:31,613 --> 01:17:31,913
CONFIRMED? 

2428
01:17:31,913 --> 01:17:32,580
>> Reporter: ENSURING HE COULD 

2429
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:34,248
GT ALL THE REPUBLICAN VOTES HE 

2430
01:17:34,248 --> 01:17:36,350
COULD FIND AND HE HOLDS THE GOP 

2431
01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:36,817
CONFERENCE TOGETHER. 

2432
01:17:36,817 --> 01:17:40,155
IF HE COULD DO THAT, IT IS BALL 

2433
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:40,689
GAME BASICALLY. 

2434
01:17:40,689 --> 01:17:41,622
BECAUSE, OF COURSE, REPUBLICANS 

2435
01:17:41,622 --> 01:17:42,991
CONTROL THE SENATE BY TWO VOTES 

2436
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:45,027
OR IF THEY NEED TO BREAK A TIE, 

2437
01:17:45,027 --> 01:17:46,094
THEY HAVE VICE PRESIDENT PENCE. 

2438
01:17:46,094 --> 01:17:48,296
SO MOST OF THE FOCUS IN THE 

2439
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:51,066
COMING DAYS WILL BEGIN WITH 

2440
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:54,302
LISA MURKOWSKI OF ALASKA AND 

2441
01:17:54,302 --> 01:17:55,737
SUSAN COLLINS OF MAINE. 

2442
01:17:55,737 --> 01:17:56,605
SENATOR COLLINS ISSUING A 

2443
01:17:56,605 --> 01:17:57,638
STATEMENT SAYING SHE IS GOING 

2444
01:17:57,638 --> 01:17:59,407
TO RESERVE JUDGMENT AND LOOKS 

2445
01:17:59,407 --> 01:18:01,777
FORWARD TO THOROUGHLY REVIEWING 

2446
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:02,110
HIS RECORD.  

2447
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:03,545
KEEP AN EYE ALSO ON A 

2448
01:18:03,545 --> 01:18:05,613
COLLECTION OF MODERATE 

2449
01:18:05,613 --> 01:18:05,913
DEMOCRATS. 

2450
01:18:05,913 --> 01:18:07,916
JOE MANCHIN OF WEST VIRGINIA AS 

2451
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:08,549
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT. 

2452
01:18:08,549 --> 01:18:10,919
JOE DONNELLY OF INDIANA AND 

2453
01:18:10,919 --> 01:18:11,719
HEIDI HEITKAMP OF NORTH DAKOTA. 

2454
01:18:11,719 --> 01:18:13,288
YOU READ OFF THERE JUST A 

2455
01:18:13,288 --> 01:18:14,422
MOMENT AGO THE STATEMENT FROM 

2456
01:18:14,422 --> 01:18:16,691
SENATOR MANCHIN SAYING HE IS 

2457
01:18:16,691 --> 01:18:17,992
GOING TO FOCUS IN ON HEALTH 

2458
01:18:17,992 --> 01:18:20,128
CARE AND WHETHER OR NOT JUDGE 

2459
01:18:20,128 --> 01:18:22,864
KAVANAUGH WOULD SORT OF 

2460
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:24,132
ESSENTIALLY PRESERVE THE 

2461
01:18:24,132 --> 01:18:25,300
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. 

2462
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:27,435
ONE OF THE NOTABLE RULINGS THAT 

2463
01:18:27,435 --> 01:18:29,237
HE HAS MADE OR VOTES HE HAS 

2464
01:18:29,237 --> 01:18:32,407
CAST WAS IN ONE OF THE CASES 

2465
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:34,175
REGARDING THE CONTRACEPTIONIVE 

2466
01:18:34,175 --> 01:18:37,012
MANDATE OF THE AFFORDABLE -- 

2467
01:18:37,012 --> 01:18:38,045
CONTRACEPTIVE MANDATE OF THE 

2468
01:18:38,045 --> 01:18:39,180
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. 

2469
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:41,116
HE, AMONG OTHER NOMINEES, HAVE 

2470
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:41,950
SUGGESTED THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE 

2471
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:43,351
FULL SCOPE OF IT. 

2472
01:18:43,351 --> 01:18:45,253
HOWEVER, HE WAS AMONG THOSE 

2473
01:18:45,253 --> 01:18:47,088
THAT SORT OF WENT ALONG WITH 

2474
01:18:47,088 --> 01:18:48,789
JOHN ROBERT'S THEORY THAT THE 

2475
01:18:48,789 --> 01:18:52,994
ACA WAS AN ESSENCE OF ATTACKS, 

2476
01:18:52,994 --> 01:18:54,663
SOMETHING THAT COULD PERSEVERE. 

2477
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:56,932
WE WILL SEE BE THAT HELPS OUT, 

2478
01:18:56,932 --> 01:18:57,799
BUT MAYBE SOME CONSERVATIVES 

2479
01:18:57,799 --> 01:19:02,003
WHO WOULD BELIEVE HE PERHAPS 

2480
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:02,470
WASN'T AS STRIDENTLY 

2481
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:02,803
CONSERVATIVE. 

2482
01:19:02,803 --> 01:19:04,205
BUT THEY WERE ON THE EXTREME. 

2483
01:19:04,205 --> 01:19:06,340
WATCH THOSE TWO MODERATE 

2484
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:06,674
REPUBLICANS. 

2485
01:19:06,674 --> 01:19:07,609
WATCH THOSE THREE MODERATE 

2486
01:19:07,609 --> 01:19:08,577
DEMOCRATS.    

2487
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,111
THEN WE WILL SEE WHERE IT GOES 

2488
01:19:10,111 --> 01:19:11,112
FROM THERE. 

2489
01:19:11,112 --> 01:19:13,347
>> WE SAW, ED, OUTSIDE THE 

2490
01:19:13,347 --> 01:19:17,051
SUPREME COURT AHEAD OF THE 

2491
01:19:17,051 --> 01:19:17,585
PRESIDENT'S ANNOUNCEMENT, 

2492
01:19:17,585 --> 01:19:18,620
DEMONSTRATORS THERE WHO WERE 

2493
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:19,588
CONCERNED AND, IN FACT, I 

2494
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:21,022
BELIEVE THIS IS A LOOK AT IT 

2495
01:19:21,022 --> 01:19:21,355
RIGHT NOW. 

2496
01:19:21,355 --> 01:19:24,659
YOU SEE SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS 

2497
01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:26,661
OUTSIDE THE SUPREME COURT. 

2498
01:19:26,661 --> 01:19:27,662
DO WE KNOW WHERE BRETT 

2499
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:32,000
KAVANAUGH STANDS ON THE ISSUE 

2500
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:32,433
OF ABORTION RIGHTS? 

2501
01:19:32,433 --> 01:19:33,868
>> I DON'T HAVE IT IMMEDIATELY 

2502
01:19:33,868 --> 01:19:38,006
AVAILABLE, BUT YOU KNOW, HE 

2503
01:19:38,006 --> 01:19:39,841
WOULD NOT BE SOMEONE SUFFICIENT 

2504
01:19:39,841 --> 01:19:40,942
FOR THIS LIST BECAUSE YOU KNOW 

2505
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:42,510
REMEMBER THIS WAS A LIST 

2506
01:19:42,510 --> 01:19:46,715
COMPILED BY THE HERITAGE 

2507
01:19:46,715 --> 01:19:49,985
FOUNDATION AND THE TRUMP 

2508
01:19:49,985 --> 01:19:50,252
CAMPAIGN. 

2509
01:19:50,252 --> 01:19:54,389
THEY WILL BE HEADED RURAL IN A 

2510
01:19:54,389 --> 01:19:57,525
WAY THAT WOULD PRESERVE ROE V. 

2511
01:19:57,525 --> 01:20:01,463
WADE OR ENTERTAIN THE IDEA OF 

2512
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:03,531
EXPANDING ABORTION RIGHTS AS 

2513
01:20:03,531 --> 01:20:04,098
CONSERVATIVES WOULD PREFER 

2514
01:20:04,098 --> 01:20:04,331
BEFORE. 

2515
01:20:04,331 --> 01:20:05,433
I DON'T HAVE IT IN FRONT OF ME, 

2516
01:20:05,433 --> 01:20:06,500
SO I COULDN'T BE CERTAIN. 

2517
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:07,469
BUT HE WOULDN'T HAVE MADE THIS 

2518
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:09,237
LIST THAT THE PRESIDENT WORKED 

2519
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:12,440
OFF OF IF HE WASN'T DUE TO 

2520
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:15,143
BESUFFICIENT IN THAT REGARD. 

2521
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:16,311
>> YOU MENTIONEDLY IS A 

2522
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:17,879
MURKOWSKI AND SUSAN COLLINS. 

2523
01:20:17,879 --> 01:20:19,814
AS WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 

2524
01:20:19,814 --> 01:20:22,150
HERE AROUND THE TABLE, THERE 

2525
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:23,151
ARE ULTIMATELY, THEY ARE 

2526
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:25,353
REPUBLICANS.    

2527
01:20:25,353 --> 01:20:27,589
SO IS THERE A REALISTIC SENSE 

2528
01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:31,393
THAT THERE IS A DANGER OF THEM 

2529
01:20:31,393 --> 01:20:32,961
BREAKING AWAY BECAUSE OF ALL 

2530
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:34,763
THE CHOICES HERE. 

2531
01:20:34,763 --> 01:20:43,305
THERE WAS A CONCERN THAT MAYBES 

2532
01:20:43,305 --> 01:20:44,105
AMY CONEY BARRETT WOULD -- 

2533
01:20:44,105 --> 01:20:45,740
MAYBE AMY CONEY BARRETT WOULD 

2534
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:46,173
HAVE BEEN TOO MUCH. 

2535
01:20:46,173 --> 01:20:48,075
BUT NOW GIVEN THE FACT THAT IT 

2536
01:20:48,075 --> 01:20:50,177
IS BRETT KAVANAUGH, DO YOU 

2537
01:20:50,177 --> 01:20:53,348
THINK THAT MAY, IN FACT, EASE 

2538
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:55,549
SOME OF THAT CONCERN? 

2539
01:20:55,549 --> 01:20:56,784
>> THERE IS REASON TO BELIEVE 

2540
01:20:56,784 --> 01:20:58,854
IT WOULD BE EASIER TO WIN OVER 

2541
01:20:58,854 --> 01:20:59,887
THEIR SUPPORT, WHERE THERE IS 

2542
01:20:59,887 --> 01:21:03,825
GOING TO BE TROUBLE NOW BASED 

2543
01:21:03,825 --> 01:21:05,526
ON THE ASSESSMENT OF SENATE 

2544
01:21:05,526 --> 01:21:08,830
MAJORITY LEADER, MCCONNELL OVER 

2545
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:09,097
THE WEEK. 

2546
01:21:09,097 --> 01:21:12,099
IS THE PAPER TRAIL KAVANAUGH 

2547
01:21:12,099 --> 01:21:12,300
HAS. 

2548
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:14,102
PREVIOUS TO THAT HE DEALT WITH 

2549
01:21:14,102 --> 01:21:19,174
A LOT OF PAPER WORK WHEN HE 

2550
01:21:19,174 --> 01:21:20,675
SERVED AS A STAFF SECRETARY, 

2551
01:21:20,675 --> 01:21:23,310
WHO CONTROLS THE PAPER THROW TO 

2552
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:23,577
THE DESK. 

2553
01:21:23,577 --> 01:21:25,914
IT DOESN'T MEAN HE WROTE THE 

2554
01:21:25,914 --> 01:21:27,716
PAPERWORK THAT'S HANDED TO THE 

2555
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:28,016
PRESIDENT. 

2556
01:21:28,016 --> 01:21:29,017
HE WOULD HAVE REVIEWED IT. 

2557
01:21:29,017 --> 01:21:32,654
SO THEY ARE GOING TO 

2558
01:21:32,654 --> 01:21:37,392
UNDOUBTEDLY BE ATTEMPTED FOR 

2559
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:39,394
DEMOCRATS TO WITH INVOLVED 

2560
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:41,029
ESPECIALLY AFTER THE SEVEN 11 

2561
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:41,329
ATTACKS. 

2562
01:21:41,329 --> 01:21:44,432
YOU HEARD HIM SAY THERE IN HIS 

2563
01:21:44,432 --> 01:21:45,699
INTRODUCTORY REMARKS THAT HE 

2564
01:21:45,699 --> 01:21:46,534
WORKED AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND 

2565
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:48,068
WAS THERE ON 9/11. 

2566
01:21:48,068 --> 01:21:50,005
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN BECAUSE THIS 

2567
01:21:50,005 --> 01:21:52,307
IS SOMEONE WHO HANDLED -- WOULD 

2568
01:21:52,307 --> 01:21:53,574
HAVE BEEN BECAUSE THIS IS 

2569
01:21:53,574 --> 01:21:55,342
SOMEONE WHO HANDLES THE PAPER 

2570
01:21:55,342 --> 01:21:55,543
FLOW. 

2571
01:21:55,543 --> 01:21:57,612
IF NOT DERAIL THE NOMINATION, 

2572
01:21:57,612 --> 01:21:59,681
CERTAINLY PROLONG IT AND FORCE 

2573
01:21:59,681 --> 01:22:01,882
A VOTE LATER IN THE TIMETABLE 

2574
01:22:01,882 --> 01:22:03,518
THAN REPUBLICANS WOULD PREFER. 

2575
01:22:03,518 --> 01:22:06,621
THE OTHER THING TOO IS THAT 

2576
01:22:06,621 --> 01:22:11,459
REPUBLICAN, AS WE TALKING 

2577
01:22:11,459 --> 01:22:14,329
ABOUT, DURING THE CLINTON 

2578
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:14,662
IMPOACHMENT. 

2579
01:22:14,662 --> 01:22:15,330
WHAT MIGHT REFLECT OPINION WHAT 

2580
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:16,431
IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW WITH 

2581
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:17,599
PRESIDENT TRUMP GIVEN THAT 

2582
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:19,834
THERE IS A SPECIAL COUNCIL JUST 

2583
01:22:19,834 --> 01:22:21,369
AS KENT STAR WAS, INVESTIGATING 

2584
01:22:21,369 --> 01:22:22,303
THE CURRENT PRESIDENT, YOU 

2585
01:22:22,303 --> 01:22:24,772
KNOW, WILL HE BE ASKED TO 

2586
01:22:24,772 --> 01:22:25,139
COMMENT ON THA? 

2587
01:22:25,139 --> 01:22:27,542
WILL IT BE RELEVANT AT ALL OR 

2588
01:22:27,542 --> 01:22:29,311
SEEN OUT OF BOUNDS? 

2589
01:22:29,311 --> 01:22:32,013
THERE IS A LOT TO WORK WITH 

2590
01:22:32,013 --> 01:22:32,213
HIM. 

2591
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:35,784
THERE IS NO DOUBT HE IS AN 

2592
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:36,351
EXPERIENCED JUDICIAL MIND. 

2593
01:22:36,351 --> 01:22:41,456
NO DOUBT HE CHECKS A LOT OF 

2594
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:42,957
BOXES FOR CONSERVATIVE. 

2595
01:22:42,957 --> 01:22:44,892
HIS SUPPORTERS WILL EMBRACE THE 

2596
01:22:44,892 --> 01:22:47,462
FACT HE'S A FAMILY MAN WITH TWO 

2597
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:49,263
YOUNG DAUGHTERS, VERY ACTIVE IN 

2598
01:22:49,263 --> 01:22:49,798
THEIR COMMUNITY. 

2599
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:53,067
BUT HE DOES NOTHING TO FULFILL 

2600
01:22:53,067 --> 01:22:55,703
THE PRESIDENT'S VOW TO DRAIN 

2601
01:22:55,703 --> 01:22:56,036
THE SWAMP. 

2602
01:22:56,036 --> 01:22:57,405
THIS IS SOMEONE BORN AND RAISED 

2603
01:22:57,405 --> 01:22:58,206
IN WASHINGTON, HAS BUILT A 

2604
01:22:58,206 --> 01:22:59,974
PROFESSIONAL CAREER IN 

2605
01:22:59,974 --> 01:23:00,275
WASHINGTON. 

2606
01:23:00,275 --> 01:23:02,644
MET HIS WIFE WHILE WORKING AT 

2607
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:03,378
THE WHITE HOUSE. 

2608
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:06,648
HIS WIFE IS ON THE TOWN COUNCIL 

2609
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:09,217
OF CHEVY CHASE, WHICH IS A 

2610
01:23:09,217 --> 01:23:14,488
COMMUNITY JUST OUTSIDE 

2611
01:23:14,488 --> 01:23:14,822
WASHINGTON. 

2612
01:23:14,822 --> 01:23:18,026
CERTAINLY ADJOINS THE SWAMP 

2613
01:23:18,026 --> 01:23:20,929
WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIFFICULTY 

2614
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:21,762
IN THE LATEST THEY BELIEVE. 

2615
01:23:21,762 --> 01:23:23,230
THAT IS AN INTERESTING, YOU 

2616
01:23:23,230 --> 01:23:24,965
KNOW, THING, THAT WE KNOW AT 

2617
01:23:24,965 --> 01:23:27,168
ONE POINT ANOTHER, HE WAS 

2618
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:28,770
LOOKING AT NOMINEES WHO WERE 

2619
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:34,409
NOT EDUCATED AT HARVARD OR 

2620
01:23:34,409 --> 01:23:34,609
YALE. 

2621
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:34,976
KAVANAUGH WAS. 

2622
01:23:34,976 --> 01:23:36,143
SO IN THAT REGARD THAT IS AT 

2623
01:23:36,143 --> 01:23:39,614
LEAST A DEPARTURE FROM TRUMP'S 

2624
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:40,115
OTHER VOWS. 

2625
01:23:40,115 --> 01:23:40,748
UNDOUBTEDLY CONSERVATIVES WILL 

2626
01:23:40,748 --> 01:23:42,517
BE HAPPY WITH THIS PICK. 

2627
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:43,517
MOST LIBERALS WILL BE FURIOUS 

2628
01:23:43,517 --> 01:23:43,817
ABOUT THIS. 

2629
01:23:43,817 --> 01:23:44,685
ULTIMATELY KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE 

2630
01:23:44,685 --> 01:23:44,953
BALL. 

2631
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:47,288
CAN HE GET TO AT LEAST 50 

2632
01:23:47,288 --> 01:23:47,521
VOTES? 

2633
01:23:47,521 --> 01:23:49,557
CAN HE HOLD THE REPUBLICAN 

2634
01:23:49,557 --> 01:23:50,024
CONFERENCE TOGETHER? 

2635
01:23:50,024 --> 01:23:52,193
AND IF HE DOES, THAT IS GAME 

2636
01:23:52,193 --> 01:23:53,895
SET MATCH AND THIS THING IS 

2637
01:23:53,895 --> 01:23:54,795
GOING TO A CONFIRMATION VOTE. 

2638
01:23:54,795 --> 01:23:56,398
HE'LL BE ON THE COURT BY THE 

2639
01:23:56,398 --> 01:23:56,598
FALL. 

2640
01:23:56,598 --> 01:23:58,032
>> ALL RIGHT, ED O'KEEFE IN 

2641
01:23:58,032 --> 01:23:58,666
WASHINGTON FOR US. 

2642
01:23:58,666 --> 01:24:00,235
ED, THANKS SO MUCH. 

2643
01:24:00,235 --> 01:24:02,437
>>> LET'S HEAD TO 1600 

2644
01:24:02,437 --> 01:24:03,537
PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE RIGHT NOW, 

2645
01:24:03,537 --> 01:24:05,640
THE NORTH LAWN, AND CBS NEWS 

2646
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:07,208
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, 

2647
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:07,942
WEIJIA JIANG THERE. 

2648
01:24:07,942 --> 01:24:09,277
SO WEIJIA, YOU WERE IN THE EAST 

2649
01:24:09,277 --> 01:24:11,279
ROOM FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

2650
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:11,612
ANNOUNCEMENT. 

2651
01:24:11,612 --> 01:24:12,246
TELL US ABOUT WHAT THAT MOOD 

2652
01:24:12,246 --> 01:24:19,888
WAS LIKE AND WHAT YOU SAW. 

2653
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:21,890
>> Reporter: AS THE PRESIDENT 

2654
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:24,592
WALKED OUT, HE WAS REALLY 

2655
01:24:24,592 --> 01:24:26,594
BEAMING BECAUSE HE UNDERSTANDS 

2656
01:24:26,594 --> 01:24:27,995
HOW IMPORTANT THIS DECISION IS, 

2657
01:24:27,995 --> 01:24:29,964
A DEFINING MOMENT OF HIS 

2658
01:24:29,964 --> 01:24:30,264
PRESIDENCY. 

2659
01:24:30,264 --> 01:24:32,133
HE HAD BEEN TEASING IT ALL WEEK 

2660
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:34,068
LONG IN TWEETS AND ANY TIME HE 

2661
01:24:34,068 --> 01:24:36,237
COULD SPEAK OUT IN PUBLIC. 

2662
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:41,442
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO IM. 

2663
01:24:41,442 --> 01:24:43,378
BECAUSE OF THAT, UNTIL THE 

2664
01:24:43,378 --> 01:24:44,212
WORDS JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH 

2665
01:24:44,212 --> 01:24:45,713
LEFT HIS LIPS, HE TOOK GREAT 

2666
01:24:45,713 --> 01:24:47,348
EFFORT TO KEEP THAT NAME SEALED 

2667
01:24:47,348 --> 01:24:48,283
BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT ANY 

2668
01:24:48,283 --> 01:24:50,218
LEAK TO SORT OF DAMPER HIS 

2669
01:24:50,218 --> 01:24:51,519
MOMENT, HIS NIGHT, NOT THAT IT 

2670
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:53,621
WAS A SURPRISE, YOU KNOW, AS 

2671
01:24:53,621 --> 01:24:54,589
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALL 

2672
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:56,324
NIGHT.    

2673
01:24:56,324 --> 01:24:59,093
ON PAPER, IT MAKES PERFECT 

2674
01:24:59,093 --> 01:25:00,428
SENSE FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP TO 

2675
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:00,961
CHOOSE JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

2676
01:25:00,961 --> 01:25:03,230
HE HAD THE CREDENTIALS, THE 

2677
01:25:03,230 --> 01:25:05,667
PEDIGREE, THE EXPERIENCE THAT 

2678
01:25:05,667 --> 01:25:07,335
HE SO ADMIRES.    

2679
01:25:07,335 --> 01:25:10,405
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU 

2680
01:25:10,405 --> 01:25:11,439
NEVER KNOW WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP 

2681
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:14,008
AND EVEN IF THEY HAVE SOMETHING 

2682
01:25:14,008 --> 01:25:17,445
ON A RESUME THAT LOOKS GOOD, 

2683
01:25:17,445 --> 01:25:22,917
YOU DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW HE 

2684
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:23,284
HEIGHT CHOOSE. 

2685
01:25:23,284 --> 01:25:25,153
BUT ONE THING WE CLEARLY SAW 

2686
01:25:25,153 --> 01:25:26,888
TONIGHT IN THE EAST ROOM WAS 

2687
01:25:26,888 --> 01:25:28,923
THE PERSON WHO JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

2688
01:25:28,923 --> 01:25:29,223
IS, RIGHT? 

2689
01:25:29,223 --> 01:25:30,691
AND THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BY 

2690
01:25:30,691 --> 01:25:30,925
DESIGN. 

2691
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:32,126
HIS FAMILY WAS RIGHT NEXT TO 

2692
01:25:32,126 --> 01:25:32,326
HIM. 

2693
01:25:32,326 --> 01:25:33,695
HE LOOKED OUT TO HIS PARENTS 

2694
01:25:33,695 --> 01:25:36,164
WHO WERE SITTING NEXT TO FIRST 

2695
01:25:36,164 --> 01:25:37,131
LADY MELANIA TRUMP. 

2696
01:25:37,131 --> 01:25:38,166
HIS WIFE AND TWO YOUNG 

2697
01:25:38,166 --> 01:25:39,367
DAUGHTERS WERE NEXT TO HIM. 

2698
01:25:39,367 --> 01:25:40,868
HE TALKED ABOUT THEM A LOT. 

2699
01:25:40,868 --> 01:25:42,804
HE TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH HE 

2700
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:44,639
LOVED HIS FAMILY, HOW HE LOVED 

2701
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:47,342
BEING A FATHER, AND EVEN GAVE, 

2702
01:25:47,342 --> 01:25:49,444
YOU KNOW, A LOW FIVE TO HIS 

2703
01:25:49,444 --> 01:25:49,877
YOUNGEST DAUGHTER. 

2704
01:25:49,877 --> 01:25:52,480
TALKED ABOUT HIS OTHER 

2705
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:52,913
DAUGHTER'S SOFTBALL 

2706
01:25:52,913 --> 01:25:53,247
CHAMPIONSHIP. 

2707
01:25:53,247 --> 01:25:53,881
HE HAPPENS TO COACH THEIR TEAM. 

2708
01:25:53,881 --> 01:25:56,951
SO HE WAS ABLE TO PRESENT A 

2709
01:25:56,951 --> 01:25:57,885
DIFFERENT PICTURE THAN WHAT 

2710
01:25:57,885 --> 01:25:59,420
WE'VE BEEN REPORTING, WHICH IS 

2711
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:01,856
BASICALLY ALL OF HIS 

2712
01:26:01,856 --> 01:26:02,457
CREDENTIALS, RIGHT? 

2713
01:26:02,457 --> 01:26:04,125
AND SO WE KNOW PRESIDENT TRUMP 

2714
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:05,159
VALUES THIS. 

2715
01:26:05,159 --> 01:26:06,261
WHEN HE FEELS THAT CHEMISTRY 

2716
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:07,729
WITH SOMEONE, WHEN HE SEES 

2717
01:26:07,729 --> 01:26:09,530
SOMEONE IS A FAMILY MAN AS HE 

2718
01:26:09,530 --> 01:26:11,699
HAS TALKED ABOUT IN THE PAST, 

2719
01:26:11,699 --> 01:26:12,867
HE APPRECIATES THAT.    

2720
01:26:12,867 --> 01:26:14,836
ALL THAT BEING SAID AS ED WAS 

2721
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:16,104
JUST TALKING ABOUT, THIS IS 

2722
01:26:16,104 --> 01:26:17,371
GOING TO BE A GRUELING PROCESS 

2723
01:26:17,371 --> 01:26:19,541
TO GET HIM CONFIRMED. 

2724
01:26:19,541 --> 01:26:21,075
THE WHITE HOUSE IS WELL AWARE 

2725
01:26:21,075 --> 01:26:21,442
OF THAT. 

2726
01:26:21,442 --> 01:26:23,244
IN FACT SOURCES HERE, THEY TOLD 

2727
01:26:23,244 --> 01:26:25,546
US THEY WERE PREPARED WITH FOUR 

2728
01:26:25,546 --> 01:26:27,281
DIFFERENT ROLLOUT PLANS BECAUSE 

2729
01:26:27,281 --> 01:26:28,649
THERE WERE FOUR POTENTIAL 

2730
01:26:28,649 --> 01:26:29,951
CANDIDATES ON THE PRESIDENT'S 

2731
01:26:29,951 --> 01:26:30,718
SHORT LIST.  

2732
01:26:30,718 --> 01:26:31,919
AND THEY WERE READY TO GO 

2733
01:26:31,919 --> 01:26:33,621
BECAUSE THEY KNEW AS SOON AS 

2734
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:34,989
THAT NAME WAS ANNOUNCED, THEY 

2735
01:26:34,989 --> 01:26:37,525
WERE ON A MISSION TO TRY TO GET 

2736
01:26:37,525 --> 01:26:38,226
THIS PERSON CONFIRMED. 

2737
01:26:38,226 --> 01:26:39,660
THEY ARE ALREADY AT WORK. 

2738
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:42,930
THE TEAM IS LED BY WHITE HOUSE 

2739
01:26:42,930 --> 01:26:44,131
COUNCIL DON MCGAHN WHO PLAYED 

2740
01:26:44,131 --> 01:26:45,967
THE SAME ROLE WHEN JUSTICE NEIL 

2741
01:26:45,967 --> 01:26:47,368
GORSUCH WAS NOMINATED. 

2742
01:26:47,368 --> 01:26:48,436
THEY ARE WELL AWARE OF THE WORK 

2743
01:26:48,436 --> 01:26:48,803
AHEAD OF THEM. 

2744
01:26:48,803 --> 01:26:51,105
BUT AS FOR TONIGHT, IT WAS A 

2745
01:26:51,105 --> 01:26:52,539
TREMENDOUS MOMENT FOR PRESIDENT 

2746
01:26:52,539 --> 01:26:54,008
TRUMP, HIS NOW SECOND NOMINEE. 

2747
01:26:54,008 --> 01:26:56,944
AND IT IS REALLY A CAMPAIGN 

2748
01:26:56,944 --> 01:26:57,311
PROMISE FILLED. 

2749
01:26:57,311 --> 01:26:58,346
>> ALL RIGHT, WEIJIA JIANG AT 

2750
01:26:58,346 --> 01:27:00,148
THE WHITE HOUSE FOR US, WEIJIA, 

2751
01:27:00,148 --> 01:27:01,316
THANK YOU.   

2752
01:27:01,316 --> 01:27:03,650
>>> JOINING ME NOW FROM OUR 

2753
01:27:03,650 --> 01:27:05,819
ANALYSIS IS JESSE WEBER, AN 

2754
01:27:05,819 --> 01:27:11,359
ATTORNEY AND HOST AT THE LAW 

2755
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:13,227
AND CRIME NETWORK. 

2756
01:27:13,227 --> 01:27:14,162
JESSICA LIVENSON IS A LOW 

2757
01:27:14,162 --> 01:27:15,930
PROFESSION JOINING US NOW. 

2758
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:21,468
WELCOME TO YOU BOTH. 

2759
01:27:21,468 --> 01:27:21,969
HOW

2760
01:27:21,969 --> 01:27:24,005
>> IT IS NOT JUST A DIFFERENCE. 

2761
01:27:24,005 --> 01:27:26,040
THEY HAVE A SIMILARITY IN 

2762
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,141
EDUCATION AND PEDIGREE AND 

2763
01:27:27,141 --> 01:27:28,443
CREDENTIALS, WHICH IS ALL 

2764
01:27:28,443 --> 01:27:28,676
GREAT. 

2765
01:27:28,676 --> 01:27:29,777
BUT THE IMPACT OF THIS DECISION 

2766
01:27:29,777 --> 01:27:31,245
IS REALLY WHAT MAKES THIS SO 

2767
01:27:31,245 --> 01:27:31,545
DIFFERENT. 

2768
01:27:31,545 --> 01:27:33,213
THIS MAN IS GOING TO BE 

2769
01:27:33,213 --> 01:27:33,547
SCRUTINIZED. 

2770
01:27:33,547 --> 01:27:35,616
WE TALKED ABOUT IT OVER 300 

2771
01:27:35,616 --> 01:27:35,883
OPINIONS. 

2772
01:27:35,883 --> 01:27:36,517
THE HOMEWORK THAT IS GOING TO 

2773
01:27:36,517 --> 01:27:38,619
HAVE TO BE DONE BY THE SENATORS 

2774
01:27:38,619 --> 01:27:40,388
AND THE CLERKS IS NOT AN EASY 

2775
01:27:40,388 --> 01:27:42,189
TASK AND NOT A FUN TASK. 

2776
01:27:42,189 --> 01:27:44,258
EVERY WORD, EVERY DECISION WILL 

2777
01:27:44,258 --> 01:27:44,558
BE GRILLED. 

2778
01:27:44,558 --> 01:27:47,128
NOW HIS RECORD IS A LITTLE BIT 

2779
01:27:47,128 --> 01:27:48,295
DIFFERENT THAN GORSUCH. 

2780
01:27:48,295 --> 01:27:50,798
HE CAME FROM A VERY DIFFERENT 

2781
01:27:50,798 --> 01:27:51,098
BACKGROUND. 

2782
01:27:51,098 --> 01:27:54,168
HE SERVED ON THE DC COURT OF 

2783
01:27:54,168 --> 01:27:54,434
APPEALS. 

2784
01:27:54,434 --> 01:27:56,938
HE WORKED AS A STAFF SECRETARY 

2785
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:57,338
WITH GEORGE BUSH. 

2786
01:27:57,338 --> 01:27:58,539
HIS BACKGROUND IS DIFFERENT. 

2787
01:27:58,539 --> 01:28:00,608
THAT IS ALL IMPORTANT MOVING 

2788
01:28:00,608 --> 01:28:00,875
FORWARD. 

2789
01:28:00,875 --> 01:28:02,709
I THINK THE WORDS THAT HE 

2790
01:28:02,709 --> 01:28:04,178
DELIVERED TONIGHT WERE VERY 

2791
01:28:04,178 --> 01:28:05,980
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT GORSUCH 

2792
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:06,280
DELIVERED. 

2793
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:08,182
DID YOU HEAR THE FLAVOR OF 

2794
01:28:08,182 --> 01:28:08,649
WOMEN, WOMEN, WOMEN? 

2795
01:28:08,649 --> 01:28:09,817
IT'S BECAUSE OF THE ELEPHANT IN 

2796
01:28:09,817 --> 01:28:11,385
THE ROOM WITH ROE V. WADE. 

2797
01:28:11,385 --> 01:28:12,620
HE IS VERY STRATEGIC. 

2798
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:13,788
BY THE WAY THIS IS THE FIRST 

2799
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:18,159
TIME MANY PEOPLE HAVE EVER 

2800
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:19,961
HEARD HIM SPEAK, GIVING YOU AN 

2801
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:24,866
IDEA OF HOW STRATEGIC HE MIGHT 

2802
01:28:24,866 --> 01:28:25,032
BE. 

2803
01:28:25,032 --> 01:28:26,567
>> WHAT DID YOU  HEAR IN THE 

2804
01:28:26,567 --> 01:28:27,834
REMARKS BY JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

2805
01:28:27,834 --> 01:28:28,068
TODAY? 

2806
01:28:28,068 --> 01:28:29,337
>> I HEARD HIM TELLING US 

2807
01:28:29,337 --> 01:28:30,070
SOMETHING ABOUT HIMSELF. 

2808
01:28:30,070 --> 01:28:31,839
I HEARD HIM TALKING ABOUT HIS 

2809
01:28:31,839 --> 01:28:32,340
PARENTS. 

2810
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:33,941
I HEARD HIM TALKING ABOUT THE 

2811
01:28:33,941 --> 01:28:35,776
IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC SERVICE, A 

2812
01:28:35,776 --> 01:28:36,009
FAMILY. 

2813
01:28:36,009 --> 01:28:37,545
HE TALKED ABOUT THE OLDER 

2814
01:28:37,545 --> 01:28:39,046
GENERATION, THE YOUNGER 

2815
01:28:39,046 --> 01:28:39,346
GENERATION. 

2816
01:28:39,346 --> 01:28:39,914
HE PRAISED HIS WIFE. 

2817
01:28:39,914 --> 01:28:41,983
I THINK A LOT OF WHAT HE WAS 

2818
01:28:41,983 --> 01:28:43,351
DOING TONIGHT WAS INTRODUCING 

2819
01:28:43,351 --> 01:28:45,853
HIMSELF TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC 

2820
01:28:45,853 --> 01:28:48,122
AS SOMEONE WHO IS LIKABLE, WHO 

2821
01:28:48,122 --> 01:28:50,825
CARES ABOUT WHAT THEY CARE 

2822
01:28:50,825 --> 01:28:51,058
ABOUT. 

2823
01:28:51,058 --> 01:28:52,493
I THINK WHAT HE WAS REALLY 

2824
01:28:52,493 --> 01:28:53,828
DOING IS SAYING THERE IS NO 

2825
01:28:53,828 --> 01:28:54,996
REASON TO BE WORRIED ABOUT ME 

2826
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:57,598
IF YOU ARE TO THE LEFT OF THE 

2827
01:28:57,598 --> 01:28:57,832
AISLE. 

2828
01:28:57,832 --> 01:28:59,434
I'M A VERY REASONABLE PERSON.   

2829
01:28:59,434 --> 01:29:00,835
WE CAN IDENTIFY WITH EACH 

2830
01:29:00,835 --> 01:29:02,135
OTHER, AND THEN IN A LOT OF 

2831
01:29:02,135 --> 01:29:04,672
WAYS IT WAS A WAY A POLITICIAN 

2832
01:29:04,672 --> 01:29:06,741
MIGHT INTRODUCE THEMSELVES TO 

2833
01:29:06,741 --> 01:29:08,609
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC SAYING WE 

2834
01:29:08,609 --> 01:29:10,511
ARE PARENTS AND HERE IS HOW I 

2835
01:29:10,511 --> 01:29:10,945
MET MY WIFE. 

2836
01:29:10,945 --> 01:29:13,448
HERE IS A LITTLE SOMETHING 

2837
01:29:13,448 --> 01:29:13,848
ABOUT MY FAMILY. 

2838
01:29:13,848 --> 01:29:15,616
I'M HUGELY HUMBLED TO BE HERE. 

2839
01:29:15,616 --> 00:00:00,000
SO AGAIN, I THINK A LOT
