so last Friday a splinter of the powerful Turkish military attempted a coup against President Recep Tayyip el de Juan who's an Islamist with a taste for the authoritarian era de Juan has spent the past decade purging the military of secularists integrating his own brand of radical Islam into the government in the process he's also made for himself 182 million dollar fortune he's built himself three palaces including a 650 million dollar Saddam Eska monstrosity he's cracked down on journalists he's gone soft on Isis and he threatened to get rid of the Constitutional Court he is in short an aspiring dictator sadly as we all know the coup failed or maybe the coup is just a setup her Diwan has used the failure of the coup as an excuse to completely purge his enemies he's demanded the United States handover a moderate cleric he seizes his enemy he's detained or suspended 20,000 police civil service judiciary and army members he's called to reinstate the death penalty for anyone who attempted the coup 1500 finance ministry officials were thrown out thousands of Dean's of colleges were and 30 governors were fired as well so in response US Secretary of State John Kerry blustered through his crazy face Nadal has a requirement with respect to democracy given the the Obama administration stood by and did nothing after Syrian dictator Bashar Assad used chemical weapons on his own citizens everyone probably laughed out loud at this particular missive so here's the question was the coup moral some on the Left say no my columnist for The Guardian a socialist named Owen Jones tweeted quote you don't have to support turkeys government an attack on democracy is an attack on democracy everywhere except of course that that's stupid an attempted coup against Adolf Hitler who became Chancellor of Germany Germany legitimately in 1932 or against Benito Mussolini who became Prime Minister of Italy through democratic means in 1922 would have been justified today a coup against an elected government in Iran would be similarly decent as would a coup against the elected government in hamas-controlled Gaza for well over a century the left has mistaken the means of democracy for democratic values that confusion has converted republics into tyrannies just because people elect their dictators doesn't make the dictators legit that's the whole point of the Constitution there are certain rights that are inviolable even by a majority if a majority voted to an slave minority according to Jones is logic Akua would be a legitimate after all that be overturning the popular will presumably that's why she's a socialist for him morality follows the majority just vote other people's money to yourself but morality doesn't follow the majority democracy and classical liberalism they should go hand in hand but they don't always a people trained in classical liberalism will vote for it a people trained in tyranny will vote for tyranny that's what's been happening in Turkey increasingly it's what's happening everywhere values have to trump democracy if that you come into conflict they don't have to but it's our job to educate our kids and indeed populations around the world about what classical liberal values look like if we don't people will choose their own chains and just because you choose your get your own chains doesn't mean those chains are somehow any less

sad about this obviously Donald Trump however was very happy about all this in a look we knew this was coming there's no great shock Donald Trump is the nominee we've known for months that he was going to be the nominee all of these sort of various machination 'he's at the convention we're going nowhere they were sort of amusing Nick but they weren't gonna go anywhere Trump was going to be the nominee we've known this for months and months it was a little galling to watch the spectacle of people cheering for Donald Trump becoming the nominee but you know that's just the way these conventions go so no no no harm no foul everybody's kind of doing what they do at these particular conventions here's what Trump looked like when he celebrated clinching the nomination appeared via video on the big TV at the convention because I think he's planning to be on I think pretty much every night a little over one year ago I announced my candidacy for president and with your vote today this stage of the presidential process has come to a close together we've achieved historic results with the largest vote total in the history of the Republican Party this is a movement but we have to go all the way I'm so proud to be your nominee for president of the United States I look forward to sharing my thoughts with you on Thursday night on how we build a brighter and more hopeful future for all Americans it's an honor to run on a ticket with Governor Mike Pence who is an incredible man and we'll make a great great vice-president I'll be with him in Cleveland tomorrow night and we'll be together again on Thursday night and by the way we are going to win the state of Ohio and also of course we're going to win the presidency and bring real change and leading back to Washington this is going to be a leadership by the way that puts the American people first we're going to switch back our job he's doing a second that's fine I mean this is the shtick that he has to do there are there some trumpian touches to the convention yesterday overall day too much better than day one we talked about all the foibles of day one all the kind of flaws the media nitpicking those flaws day two was much smoother it ran a lot smoother there there were a couple of trumpian touches so for example the president of the UFC the Ultimate Fighting Championship Dana White he showed up to talk for Trump and it got a little weird for a moment and in my opinion you can really tell a person's true character when they're happy for somebody's else success okay and I think that sense of loyalty and commitment will translate into how he will run this country and let's be honest folks we need somebody who believes in this country we need somebody who's proud in his country who will fight for this country and then the shot cuts to a couple of Democrats are drum skids and the Octagon descends and then and then Chris Christie fights Newt Gingrich for a hamburger so in any case that was not the main import of last night the main import level last night you know what went better for Trump because this was the main import of last night the main import of last night was that the Republicans really went after Hillary hard and there were no big distraction so the fact that they were going after Hillary hard made the media a little bit crazy so this was the the moment that drove the media out of its mind Chris Christie put down his shine box long enough to go to the to go and actually speak at the convention and make the case that he basically should have been the VP pick cuz he's a really good attack dog and so he went there he did his attack dog routine against Hillary and it was very effective it was very good it was very prosecutorial he wants his backup to be the Attorney General of the United States if you can't PvP then he'll be Attorney General and he makes pretty good case for himself here so here is chris Christie making the case for prosecuting Hillary Clinton so let's do something fun tonight tonight as a former federal prosecutor I welcome the opportunity to hold Hillary Rodham Clinton the qaol role for her performance in her character now and see lock her up right he's very happy so okay and it goes on like this and in fine okay so everybody's chanting lock her up and chris christie is getting ready to actually dive into the crowd and everybody below him is very very frightened so but but what he's saying about about hillary it's time to prosecutor of course that's true and when people chant lock her up that has a meaning right i mean the fact that they're saying lock her up there's a reason for that now the media lost its collective mind over this they lost their poop over this so they said they didn't have a headline like milania's plagiarism to talk about and so instead they decided that it was worthwhile to talking about this this was the end of the world you know how dare he say that we're going to prosecute her and the crowd is gonna chant lock her up how dare they do all this christie went on like this by the way he did a whole routine race where he kind of threw out a charge and then he said is she guilty or is she not guilty so I'm gonna ask you this Hillary Clinton as a failure for ruining Libya and creating a nest for terrorist activity by Isis answer me now is she guilty or not guilty Hillary Clinton as an apologist for an al-qaeda affiliate in Nigeria resulting in the capture of innocent young women is she guilty or not guilty he does this routine it goes on like this right so we don't need to play all of them cuz there are a lot of guilty or not guilty and it was basically like the the opening scene in Superman one where he have General Zod in the dock and all the disembodied heads going guilty right says okay this is good this is good stuff right I mean this isn't the mistake is this wasn't in primetime it should have been in primetime instead we got the CEO of the Trump winery for some odd reason talk I know I was desperate to hear from the CEO of the Trump winery and but chris Christie you know it does a good job there so the media loses their poop I mean just they lose it they absolutely lose it so ABC goes out of its mind right MSNBC we can start with MSNBC so this is MSNBC going absolutely bonkers Kelly O'Donnell just goes just goes crazy well actually you know sorry clip five whatever clip five is let's play that one I do think the lock her up chant as its received at home to that thirty two percent of the electorate will decide the outcome it seems a little banana Republican to me it's something that you're not used to hearing this country we don't lock up our political opponents the rule of law matters and it matters to Republicans and Republicans emphasized the importance of the rule of law we've just had an investigation of Hillary claim the FBI director made his recommendations to the Department of Justice said she has been dishonest she's not been truthful to the American people but there was no cause for prosecution on that and so I think that the the chance lockar up does not translate particularly well okay so this by the way is Steve Schmidt who was an advisor to the McCain campaign so naturally he doesn't like this because it's uncouth it's uncouth and it's Banana Republic let me point something out what does Banana Republic is the FBI director who is appointed by the President of the United States and the Department of Justice also appointed by the President of the United States and they're all of the same party right they all are of the same party as the candidate who used to be the Secretary of State letting her off the hook for what is obviously criminal activity that's Banana Republic it's not Banana Republic for people to say it's time to lock up the people who commit crimes it's Banana Republic to actually defend the people who commit crimes that's what a banana republic does so this is silly talk but it was like this all over the media last night at clip six right this is this is over on NBC and they do exactly the same thing Trump goes over the top heavy on harsh rhetoric much of it directed at Hillary Clinton prosecuting the case New Jersey Governor Chris Christie the charge of putting herself ahead of America guilty or not guilty delegates repeatedly calling for Clinton to be thrown in jail and it brought out a lot of the anger that we've been talking out about over the course of this campaign that is in the electorate we heard it in their chance of lock her up and guilty does that anger work at an event like this a lot of Republicans even Trump supporters didn't like the chance they thought that maybe went a little too far or does that go too far does it overestimate how much people don't care for Hillary Clinton the chanting was bad but I think it would be canceled out next week by some equally uncomfortable moment for Democrats at their convention okay so the entire media say oh my god isn't it just so terrible they're chanting lock her up it's just so terrible Hillary Clinton locked up a guy for making a YouTube video Hillary Clinton promised families of people who were murdered in Benghazi that a dude made a YouTube video that had nothing to do with anything would go to jail the Obama administration has sought out and jailed seriously journalists more often than any administration since Woodrow Wilson this idea that they're not jailing and they jailed Dinesh D'Souza for a nonsense campaign finance violation I mean this idea that they get to sit there and talk to us about rule of law is absurd of course of course Hillary Clinton should be behind bars and the reason people are ticked off and the reason people are angry is because they have every right to be angry because Hillary Clinton is a criminal and she is getting away with it and she always gets away with it because she's part of the Banana Republic inside team she's part of it so when the media sit there and they all it's so terrible it's just so Tara and that you can see they're really uncomfortable with this the Republicans are not supposed to say things like this I mean come on the Republicans are supposed to say that whatever the FBI says is okay and they're supposed to be genteel it's supposed to be like Bob Dole this isn't supposed to be like like an actual battle it's not supposed to be like that right Hillary Clinton by the way says that CEOs should have gone to prison over the over the financial collapse she can't even name the charge right she said that sort of stuff before Bernie Sanders certainly had said that sort of stuff before I didn't hear the media saying that I know doesn't saying anything at that point about it of course not of course not CBS same sort of deal they did the same routine they said it was big hate for Hillary big hate for Hillary she's very vulnerable especially after the Attorney General decided not to prosecute based on the FBI investigation but there was enough in that for them to keep it up the fact that she's been around a long time and in that crowd even people who don't like Trump necessarily they can work up a big hate for Hillary okay they can work up a big hate for Hillary that's it's all about the hatred Hillary Clinton labeled Republicans four enemies in an open debate she says the vast right-wing conspiracy is responsible for her husband accidentally putting his genitals in another person okay this is absolute it's its button it's bunk it's hogwash it's just it's garbage this is what the media are gonna do they're you know they're so angry oh here's the thing it's not gonna work these people are angry people are upset there's a reason that Hillary Clinton is plummeting in polls Trump and moving in polls from another poll out today say oh he sliced her lead in half no he's still at 36% she just went from 50 to 43 so she's falling apart the anger is justified the anti-hillary anger is totally completely justified the media are part of it because we look at you people in the media in the mainstream left media and we say you've been lying to cover up for these people for years for literally decades for my entire lifetime you've been lying to cover up for the Clintons when I was 8 when when Bill Clinton started running for office where I was born 84 so I was 8 when he said when he ran for office literally my entire life that I can remember you guys were defending the Clintons criminal activity and now you turn around you say why are you so angry that's why we're angry that's why we're angry well we have to say goodbye to our Facebook live viewers right now go to daily wire.com to subscribe you can see the rest of the show which is posted shortly you can also go to iTunes or

and then we all go surfing so so the so the to continue with the theme here Chris Matthews also sounds it off a lot about this Chris Matthew loves Hillary Clinton that good is the best I don't know why everybody's always ribbing on Hillary Clinton so beautiful so romantic shouldn't make a throw up my leg like Obama but that's for different reasons it's a different reason let me know one finds her sexually attractive her husband doesn't find her sexually attractive but I think that she's a wonderful wonderful woman has never been criticized in any way any possible way he could man you're a mistake first of all an overall sort of aesthetic as historic assessment when Christie was up there with a very rough justice I might put it of Hillary Clinton and he kept saying in each case I'm gonna ask you for your verdict it didn't remind me of the mold swords and sandals movies with the Roman Emperor going upward he wanted Dan said kill her it was almost that bloodthirsty it was like this stuff and the audience's request to respond and always with the verdict of guilty and they said in a blood-curdling way every time it's blood-curdling I mean it was reminding me of this one time when I was down in Venezuela and I saw a cockfight and I don't know why I was there or what I was doing I was really drunk at the time but I can explain to you that whenever the chicken was really wounded I would just go up or down up or down and that's what I also do with my thumbs sometimes in the pie I just go home and I go up or down up or down then I suck my thumb and it tastes delicious but let me just tell you let me just tell you after I get in here and I become my heir of the shoe outright getting here I come here and they should come on as they say Jonathan Capehart then it really is important that these people not be so bloodthirsty I mean yeah the Republicans are all criminals and they should all go to jail and die but the Democrats are blood the Democrats they don't deserve this treatment they're wonderful people they're great Hillary is wonderful she's great not only yeah they treat like it's a witch hunt I used to wish I could Salem like is the Salem witch hunt like they're gonna throw her in the lake then see if she floats or swims ha and we're gonna do then take her we're gonna throw in leg and heat if she floats your swims and if she felt that means you the witch and if she sings that means she doesn't said hi creek nazarov is here go chris go i mean i was thinking tonight and he'll have this festival of hating Hillary tonight this brewing up of almost a witch like ritual tonight I kept taking wait a minute they already hate Hillary yeah so what's the point and does this get to the middle-of-the-road voters thing you know I'm worried about my kids about that my kids I may have all kinds of issues but none of them really relate to how much I hate Hillary they relate to other things I know these people are oh I'm perfect I know Hillary's got at this credibility prom but um I got a choice here how does this make me like Trump anymore she's got an incredible 'ti and credibility discombobulated lady problem I get it I got it okay so the reason Chris let me explain to you why people are angry the reason people are angry is because people like you have been dismissing the fact that Hillary Clinton is deeply corrupt for as long as some of us have been alive right for longer than you've had that current hair line you've been doing that and Chris Matthews this is why you want to see why here is why here is here is Chris Matthews what is it easier thing for these delegates to do in the next three days yeah to find it evil and Hillary Clinton more good and Donald Trump it's far easier after everything Rudy Giuliani went way back you know just something to do with these with the listing posts in Eastern Europe you know our tenor are like any ballistic missile systems that they say that she's basically they're not to be trusted they reach for things about Harry to say that oh she let her emails get exposed to hacking blah blah blah and then of course she was responsible for what happened in Benghazi because of dereliction of duty but trying to get them to find the fervor to find the good in Donald Trump it's much harder so they go to me what they say is the evil and Hillary Clinton again and again tonight okay so he says blah blah blah right that's that's the key points it exposed her emails to the foreign powers TCR whose national security secrets and put CIA agents and blah blah blah blah blah yeah it's because you say blah blah blah that everybody reacts by saying put her in jail that's why that's why and the entire media have now surrounded the cause and this is why forget just what I think about Trump objectively speaking the media are going to savage him all of the talk about rum knew how to handle the media early on in this election cycle that applied during the primary doesn't apply now that we're in general as has been true with every Republican nominee in the last eight years 12 years so Jorge Ramos who is of Univision he has on the father of a kid this guy's kid was killed by an illegal immigrant and this just shows you how negative the media are toward anyone who disagrees with them first of all notice in the bottom left if you can't see this folks you should see on the bottom left of the screen there's a logo it says the Trump show ok the Trump show is over the DA is a circus tent next to the DA are devil horns right so that may give you a clue as to what hard hair almost things who Donald Trump and then he proceeds to basically grill this father his son was murdered by an illegal immigrant grill his father about illegal immigration you think it would be a better idea instead of doing that and maybe the police wouldn't be able to apply that law correctly with many immigrants who are not criminals how about permanent immigration reform in which everyone would go through background checks and everybody everybody the 11 million who are here isn't that a better idea I mean it could be a fear in the political part but see I'm thinking as a father who misses his son whose son didn't do nothing all my son was doing was walking down the street which is a freedom that he has he should be allowed he should be able to walk down the United States every and we don't want that to happen again that's that's what you're here that's right well any more than me personally I need more than just reform because I don't believe in that I want I want people to go after the gangbangers the Crips Blair's whoever I don't care but when I got into the fight is my son was murdered by 18th Street gang banger illegal in the country from Mexico I mean that's just what happened and Jorge Ramos can't accept that right so this is how it's gonna be all the way through to the end of the line and the media are gonna continue being obsessed with with every detail the Trump campaign now Chris Cuomo who legitimately guest on as we like to call him here on the Graham is he apparently when he was young he had he had four dozen eggs every morning to help him get large but now that he's grown he has five dozen eggs he's roughly the size of a barge in any case Chris Cuomo he he grills Donald Trump's campaign manager over plagiarism he's very very upset that Melania Trump had some paragraphs in her speech that were also in Michelle Obama's Beach so milania's speechwriter plagiarized from Michelle's speech writers of speech writers were plagiarizing from speech writers for political figures who aren't even elected which is very very very important according to Chris Cuomo whose brother is the corrupt governor of New York here he said and you don't want to deal with what happens then that's the concern that's why I don't understand you will just own this little thing and move on well Chris like they guess that's all in the eye of the beholder because the pattern that I see is a pattern of the media not being prepared to look at what's really going on in America now look at what's really happening in the Trump campaign look at what really is being tapped into and looking at why it's working not why it's failing and why it's working because you know over the last 10 months as you all have been pointing out things which aren't true to say that this is going to be a problem for the Trump campaign you've been wrong consistently the American people different versions of all the things you've just said no it isn't it's the same thing there's you're looking at things that don't exist you're looking at things that don't exist and you're not focusing on the broader message that does exist and which the American people are responding to it last night well trumpet call but that's untrue that's untrue and I don't know where you were at the beginning of this campaign but I would love to talk to you then and say do you think Donald Trump's going to be the nominee I don't think it makes you crazy or jaundiced to have been surprised by it there's also no question that you deserve a lot of credit for getting him where he was that last night you know I've said that openly and often but I've got it I've got to go back to this other point though Paul I just have to the idea that we're ignoring something that doesn't matter flies in the face of what we're about this is about the truth it's about the truth and that's all it's about okay so it's all about the truth that's all the media are about they're all about the truth grabbed up by Hillary Clinton classified emails blah blah blah we're all about the truth no you're all about a political agenda you're all about a political agenda it doesn't mean that some you don't tell the truth but it means that you're always about pushing a particular political agenda the benefits the left me another example last night ben Carson was speaking and and I'm not of a huge fan of Ben Carson's speeches I don't find them particularly inspiring but you know there are some people who really do enjoy ben Carson so here he is one of the things that I have learned about Hillary Clinton is that one of her heroes her mentors was Saul Alinsky and her senior thesis was about Saul Alinsky this was someone that she greatly admired and that affected all of her philosophies subsequently now interestingly enough let me tell you something about Saul Alinsky he wrote a book called rules for radicals on the dedication page it acknowledges Lucifer the original radical who gained his own Kingdom now think about that this is a nation where our founding document the Declaration of Independence talked about certain inalienable rights that come from our create or this is a nation where our Pledge of Allegiance says we are one nation under God so the media immediately use their mind over the media lose their mind because he invoked Lucifer okay except that everything he said there is exactly true I've read Saul Alinsky's book he does dedicate it to Lucifer and that does make a difference if I were a candidate and my favorite book ooh and it was her favorite book I mean she wrote her her thesis or senior thesis it well ously she wrote on saul linski she was regularly in contact with saul linski she brought him to Ellis Lea to speak to her college class right that doesn't make it that but the media loses their mind over this it's the end of the world and then they're gonna sit there and say that they're all about the truth that's all they care about is just the truth give me a break and the problem is that what happens here is because the media are so corrupt the media are so terrible the media are so awful it turns out that when somebody comes along in the Republican Party like Donald Trump who lies on a routine Bay she doesn't tell the truth who changes his positions at a whim and I mean we found out today folks we found out today the Donald Trump number one apparently offered the VP slot to John Kasich and told him he could handle policy so for all you people who thought that that Donald Trump was really a break from the rest of the Republican Party he basically said the John Kasich could handle everything and Donald Trump's job would be to make America great again really this is the report from the New York Times second Donald Trump wants to appoint as his secretary of the Treasury a guy named Steve minuchin Steve minuchin is a former partner at Goldman Sachs yes you guessed it Goldman Sachs he's also a fundraiser for Donald Trump who used to be a fundraiser for you guessed it or a donor to Hillary Clinton so if he's really a break from everything that came before not so much not so much but the bottom line is that when somebody comes along and they just changed what they're saying every five seconds and the media call them on it were more likely to say to the media screw you we don't believe a word you have to say and that's actually a benefit for the Trump campaign it was in the primaries and I think that it'll continue to be with a certain segments of the Republican base all I'm saying is you don't have to believe the media but do your own research figure out what's true and what's false the media have an agenda you don't have to react to the agenda of the media by saying that 100% of the things they say are false 100% of the things they say are badly motivated but that doesn't mean the 100% of the things that they say are false okay so on last night was all about attacking Hillary Clinton that's great that's great it was it was worthwhile it was it was useful and then there was the other part of the convention the other part of the convention is this really kind of difficult attempt to unify the party now I'm gonna reiterate hopefully for the last time my position on this thing okay my position on this thing has been clear for a long time you're big boys and big girls you're adults you can make your own decision about how you want to vote your vote is your own to me I'm gonna say what I think is true and I'm gonna say what I think is false and I'm gonna critique the candidates as objectively as I can and given the fact that I have political biases in in favor or not in favor of particular policies I'm in favor of principles I don't really care about candidates all that much my rationale why I have said that I will not vote for Donald Trump is not because I think anything except that Hillary Clinton is in evil harridan which I do I think she's a terrible the reason that I've said I won't vote for Donald Trump is because here's my calculus either we back him and he loses in which case we have embraced all of the terrible things that he said all of the positional vacillations all of the things that he has done that are not in line with conservatism we've handed over the party to national populist and lost and lost a generation of people who don't like the kind of stuff that Donald Trump says and find it vile and I'm talking not about his politically incorrect stuff I'm talking about as actual vile stuff than making fun of the disabled then making fun of women the suggestion that the suggestion that judges who are Mexican can't do their job because they're of Mexican ethnicity you know all of that that stuff doesn't play well in the long term for Republicans so if we lose and we go down with that guy bravely shouting at least we didn't vote for Hillary I'm not sure that that helps us in the future number two if Trump wins he becomes the face of conservatism in America and I think that to deny that is to deny reality he is the leader of the Republican Party Paul Manafort said it this is now the Trump national party this is the this is the Trump party not the Republican Party anymore that's gonna have an impact on how people think about conservatives and conservatism especially if you decide to hop on board that so that's my calculus you don't have to make that calculus I understand it's a balancing act if you hold your nose and vote for Trump because you want to stop Hillary I'm total I hear you I get it I totally get it it's totally sympathetic I I can't express my sympathy any more than that I I hear you for sure if you are not going to vote for Trump because you don't think that that he should be the leader of conservatism in America perverting it for the rest of our lives then I get that too but it's a balancing act and to ignore the balancing act I think is foolhardy that said there are serious divisions inside the Republican Party and I don't think that those can be bridged over by a little bit of Pat rhetoric Paul Ryan I think stood evidence this yesterday so Paul Ryan clearly is uncomfortable Donald Trump as the nominee I mean he really does not like me he said three weeks ago that Donald Trump was engaging in there maybe eight weeks ago the Donald Trump was engaging in what he called textbook racism against that Mexican judge carry out here is Paul Ryan now you're ripping into Hillary Clinton saying that we've made our choices at a time when men and women in both parties so clearly so undeniably won a big change in direction for America a clean break from a system and what does the Democratic Party establishment offer what is their idea of a clean break they are offering a third Obama term brought to you by another Clinton watch the Democratic Party convention next week that four-day infomercial of politically correct moralizing and let it be a reminder of all that is at stake in this election you can get through four days of it with a little help from the mute button but four more years of it not a chance not a chance the Obama years are almost over the Clinton years are way over 2016 is the year America moves on progressives deliver everything except progress democracy is a series of choices we Republicans have made our choice into the life everyone can find with opportunity and independence the happiness of using your gifts and the dignity of having a job instead so so the only the last part of that speech where he starts talking about his program is where he gets enthusiastic the rest of the time he looks like he wants to give himself a he wants to put his face in the toilet and flush it himself he actually wants to bully himself in like a bathroom stall but in any case the you can see that there is a real rift in the party and it's not going to be healed anytime soon and all this talk about unity it's not gonna happen anytime soon because it's not a unity based on principle it's a unity based on convenience and there's always some of that there's always some of that but the question is how large is the rift and the rift is pretty large in a bunch of different directions Mitch McConnell the Senate Majority Leader who has not done a particularly good job and who sat out this election cycle basically on the presidential side because he hates Ted Cruz so much so watch what happens when Senator McConnell remember this is the Senate Majority Leader for the Republican Party this is the Republican National Convention watch what happens when he walks on the stage the majority leader the United States Senate the Honorable Mitch McConnell of Kentucky they're bullying him in case you hear that ladies and gentlemen it is now time for us to determine our nominee for the office of vice-president okay so that's that's all it's important totally maternal comes on out and everybody says that everybody starts Billingham these are real divisions they're not gonna go away anytime soon and they're real divisions because the future of conservatism is at stake it's not just the future of the Republican Party there are big decisions to be made on all sides I understand people who make different decisions I'm not insisting everybody make my decision I am insisting that you think about all of the all of the various arguments on every side before you come to a sanguine conclusion I think people are making this very easy for themselves by simply by simply refusing to acknowledge truths you know the people on the never Trump side are refusing to acknowledge how horrible Hillary is and how horrible she's gonna be many of them and some people on the on the pro-trump side are refusing to acknowledge the very real costs that attend to even supporting a man is bad and as leftist as Donald Trump okay time for some things I like and then some things that I hate so we've been doing kind of scary movie villains this is different kind of scary movie villain in this time the last couple of binges like really really bad guys this one is a little bit different I don't know if you ever seen the movie All About Eve this one Best Picture in 1955 maybe in any case All About Eve is a great film it has one of the great scenes in movie history near the very end with George Sanders who you'll recognize mostly as the voice of Shere Khan from Jungle Book but George Sanders was a very big actor in his day in George Sanders plays this kind of newspaper critic all about Eve is about Betty Davis is a fading actress and this young girl basically insinuates herself into her life and starts trying to become her understudy to become an actress and then she's kind of edging her out of her own relationships very creepy villainous in the film and here's here's what it looks like here's the trailer pretty rare quality these days now girls so many rare quality Sochi scene oh you'll pointed out so often so many qualities so often her loyalty efficiency devotion warmth and affection and so young so young and so fair you my understand didn't you know cause I knew just slipped your mind find out only thing what I go after I want to go and I don't want it to come after me don't go and please stop acting as if I were the Queen Mother sorry outside of a beehive Margo your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly you're in a beehive pal didn't you know we're all busy little bees full of stings making honey day and night are we honey very touching very Academy of Dramatic Arts that bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left red clear that cynicism you refer to I cried the day I discovered I was different than little boys oh come on get up I'll buy you a drink it's a great it's a terrific film and it really holds up well it's it's a really good tight script it's really the the young woman who you see there she's the villainous and she is creepy beyond belief the Anne Baxter very creepy in this film and and in the movie is is grey Betty Davis is terrific I think she wanted an Oscar for it so ok time for well the today is is Wednesday is it not ok good so this is this week is in fact moving forward despite all indicators the time has stopped in fact time continues to move forward so well it's time for some Bible talk so quite quick correction from yesterday so yesterday we did a commercial for Harry's calm Harry's calm they sell these razors and the razors are fantastic they're there they sell you these this deal it's like 15 bucks for the for the the holder for the shaving handle for three razors and and for the shaving cream and I said that it works really great and I which is true and you go to harrys.com for a $5 discount on that Harry's calm and use the keyword bent so I got some people who are Orthodox right some Orthodox Jews who emailed me listened to the show and they said wait you're not allowed to shave using a straightedge this is true ok so the way that this works is that you you're not allowed as an Orthodox Jew because there's a portion of the Bible that says you're not allowed to cut the edges of your beard the idea is that you're not supposed to use a straightedge on your face so instead we use electric razor so just a quick correction for those who care which is like all two of you okay here's here's the deal okay I use an electric razor on my face and by the draw line I also follow Maimonides underneath the jawline it's when I say that the razors work I mean that the straightedge is work on my neck which is the hardest part to shave you can't shave it with an electric razor that being said harrys.com does provide a great product and for me you know this is always the hard part to shave so that's that so Harry's comm keyword Ben alright so this week's Bible portion is one of the most puzzling Bible portions in all of the Bible this is the section with the talking donkey alright this is a section that all the people on the left make fun of because hey it's a talking donkey right I mean where have we seen that before where we've seen a talking jackass except for like every day on this show every quote we play but aside from aside from that where do we see talking jackass oh there's this whole section in the Bible where where bill um is it was a prophet he's a he's a non-jewish prophet and he wants to curse the Jews and bilac is the king of a neighboring tribe is the king of Midian and he comes to him and he says we want you to curse the Jews and he says well I can't do that cuz God doesn't allow me to curse the Jews and then finally he's incentivized with a lot of money to go curse the Jews and so this is a section from numbers 22 and it says he's riding his donkey the shy donkey saw the angel of the Lord and it crouched down under bill on the lawns anger flared and he beat the she donkey with a stick the Lord opened the mouth of the she donkey and she said to Balaam what have I done to you that you've struck me these three times no I'm said to the she donkey for you have humiliated me if I had a sword in my hand I would kill you right now the she donkey said to Balaam am I not your she drunken which you have written since you first started until now have I been accustomed to do this he said no the Lord opened Balaam's eyes he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the road with a sword drawn in his hand he bowed and prostrating himself on his face the angel of the Lord said to him why have you beaten her she donkey these three times behold I came out to thwart you for the one embarking on the journey has hastened against me when the she donkey saw me had turned aside these three times had she not turned aside before me now I would also have killed you and spared her the she donkey okay so weird stuff right talking donkey angel appearing magically weird stuff so what's the point of this so my belief is that some of the Bible is is figurative so the point of this particular section of the is that even that we all in our lives take credit for qualities for which we are not responsible so you've heard me brag about the fact that I'm smart on the show it's just me being an ass right okay so there's like it's just me being a jackass because the reality is that I'm not responsible for the level of my intelligence right that's a genetic thing and well I'm responsible for cultivating that intelligence but it's not if I'm a smart person that's probably due to the fact that both my parents are smart people take pride in the weirdest things right we take pride in the fact that we're good-looking or in the fact that we are tall or in the fact that we are or the fact that we're smart the fact that we have certain skills that come naturally to us that were fast we take more pride in that than we do in our values than we do in being a good person the point of this section is that God can give qualities to anybody God if he wants can make a donkey talk right God can make a donkey prophesy bilam is not a special guy because God tapped him on the shoulder and decided to use him as the conduit for his word right bill um is just another guy that God decided to use as the Khans wouldn't bill I'm obviously took pride in that and that's why he was willing to be paid and he thought okay I can manipulate God I'll go there and I'll just do what I want to do that's not the way that any of this works the things you should take pride in are your cultivation of your own values the things you should take pride in are not the natural things that God gave you because hey you're not responsible for those things that's not about you and by the way that's that's also the reason why you shouldn't discriminate against people based on the things that are inherent to them the things they can't change about themselves it's why racism is so stupid and it's stupid for a variety of reasons but one of the reasons racism is so stupid is because you don't make a decision as to what race you are you make a decision as to how you act as a human being this is why you know the black lives matter movement that suggests that you get to act differently if you're black than if you're white is so nasty and the things that you're born with those are not qualities that you get to take credit for those are things that God can take credit or blame for so the whole point of this section is God saying - but what God's really saying - bill I'm here is you're an idiot like you think you're a really special guy I'll make your donkey talk to your donkey we'll see more than you right and then you'll try and beat the donkey and I'll - and I'll say well I'll kill you not the donkey because the donkey's more important than you that's the point of this particular section of the Bible so that's things I like okay one more thing I like I have a soft spot I have to admit for triumph the insult comic dog and apparently triumph the insult comic dog was at the RNC and was on CNN I haven't watched this yet so we'll see how funny it is but I just felt the need to put it on there because I want to watch it so here it is we are live from behind CNN this is triumph back-to-back on Facebook live there we are there's Anderson Cooper Anderson Cooper live on CNN and there's a not so much excitement tonight yeah pretty much when Donald Trump jr. was on no they did he's a cool guy right oh come on he's a lion hunter actually you know it's odd he actually doesn't he actually was aiming for the natives he just has very bad day Anderson Cooper ladies and gentlemen oh not as a big Ariel that's too bad I was all excited for that and Anderson Cooper so ripe for for mockery and yesterday after Donald Trump - no that's stupid okay so that's the thing I hate we'll just reclassify that one hi guys other things that I hate the entire comic subset has descended on the RNC to mock the Republicans because this is what they do so keegan-michael key yeah I think key and Peele can be hysterical some of their sketches are just absurdly funny they didn't want about the TSA and terrorism that's extraordinarily funny I did one about a riot in the inner city that it's just hysterically funny but a lot of their stuff is really funny here's keegan-michael key portraying Ohio's only black GOP delegate and it's just this is just cheap crap stupid nonsense so how does it feel being one of the few African Americans there you know it's incredible Steven from the moment I got here everyone has been so nice they gave me a hat they gave me a shirt they're always putting me on camera for some reason I mean I've never been so popular in my life well that is that simply seems nice no people keep coming up to me and saying thank god you're here and they keep on saying you're one of the good ones you're articulate you're bright I mean the compliments just keep on rolling in Steven oh my gosh jeepers me and they even invited me to all these different parties they keep saying we need you there it's amazing well do okay so the idea of course is that Republicans are very enthusiastic about having a black eye there there is some truth to that by the way which is that Republicans are enthusiastic when somebody of minority status comes to the convention because they've been so ripped down by the press for so many years as racists and terrible people that when somebody shows up and doesn't believe that lie then it's nice it's gratifying right it's one of the reasons Ben Carson and Herman Cain were so popular you have to acknowledge they get the grain of truth that being said the Democrats are significantly more exploitative of race than the Republicans I mean here he's ripping on the Republicans oh my god everybody's so nice to me cuz they want their token black guy the Democrats are legitimately having the parents of people who assaulted and tried to murder police officers speak at their convention because they're trying to pander to black people that seems significantly worse to me then here's a free hat here's a free shirt okay final thing that I that I dislike okay so Caitlyn Jenner is is that the will do a couple more because why not come on Caitlyn Jenner was at the RNC and and Caitlyn Jenner is I don't know why Caitlyn Jenner is at the RNC but apparently Caitlyn Jenner is at the RNC and talking about being a Republican and this got all sorts of press attention because of course as we all know the real reason the media followed the Caitlyn Jenner saga is not out of some great sympathy for the transgender plight it's not because they actually want Caitlyn Jenner to have a better life it's because the media are a bunch of circus carnival barkers and they think that Caitlyn Jenner is a freak show and they can make ratings off of it that's the reality of why they do this it's why they put Caitlyn Jenner on the front of their magazines they think it'll move paper so in any case Caitlyn Jenner shows up the RNC and here's what it looks like you've gotten more sort of pushback and criticism from the media because you self-identify as a Republican yes uh it was easy to come out as trans it was harder to come out as Republican okay okay one of the problems that I have with the general treatment here is sort of the token treatment that I was talking about before it's one thing to say that we're grateful that black people are showing up because it shows that they're not buying into the Democratic lies about the Republican Party it's another thing to pretend that Caitlyn Jenner is actually a woman to go along with it with the agenda here and and feature this like if Caitlyn Jenner wants to show up to the convention Caitlyn Jenner can show up to the convention but the idea that Caitlyn Jenner is being given prominent coverage there is solely due to the whole transgender thing and it's it's a little bit off-putting for Republicans to do that sort of stuff to suggest the Caitlyn Jenner as a woman because then we get to show how tolerant we are toward the transgender agenda right that's just I don't find that particularly noteworthy or important Whoopi Goldberg will finish it'll be Goldberg Whoopi Goldberg who is legitimately a very stupid person I can't say that Whoopi is the stupidest person on the view because that title is in question every day I think that's probably why people watch they floating rankings of stupidity on the view and then they just tried to determine based on each show who moves up and who moves now well Whoopi Goldberg went after Rudy Giuliani on the worst show on television the view the other day former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani crowd last night promising them what he did for New York Trump will do for America where'd you think of it I think he stole that he stole that speech from Mussolini but he also says and this is my favorite I took six hundred thousand people off welfare in New York wait how is he a liar I mean he helped get six hundred thousand people off welfare in New York and I like when they call him Mussolini because he likes the police that's Mussolini ask it's not Mussolini ask when the President of the United States whips crowds into furious fervor against the cops and then cops get shot that's not Mussolini ask it's Mussolini ask when you say law and order should be a priority and we should support our police officers well Whoopi Goldberg what can you expect from a combined panel whose IQ totals less than my shoe size so that's what we have for today tomorrow is the mailbags just show up for that and when it'll be more Republican convention stuff including Ted Cruz's speaking today so there's a lot of talk about what's he gonna do is he gonna endorse Trump is he not going to endorse Trump is everyone going to spontaneously burst into flame what sort of biblical plagues will God visit on Cleveland I mean there's gonna be so much happening and we'll be there to cover all of it I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show you
