this week Donald Trump appears to have spent a good portion of his executive time following Fox News's coverage of the migrant caravan that's currently traveling across Mexico he's very interested in it he's not really interested in the actual caravan or what it represents or why it was organized but he is very much interested in the right-wing fantasy version of it that I believe is probably inspired by the racist French seventies novel camp of the saints so he has been spreading some conspiracy theories about that we want to help to correct the record a little bit today and talk about why these caravans are happening and what's gonna happen with it so since 2014 the Mexican government has been cracking down on people traveling through to the United States the crackdown has resulted in the detention and deportation of about nine hundred and fifty thousand people and according to a 2015 United Nations report widespread torture of a particularly grotesque nature so the nonprofit Pueblo sinfronteras has organized caravans annually to draw attention to the plight of Central American migrants and to the logic of safety in numbers they believe that they will be less likely to be the target of abuse and assaults and theft and rape and things like that if they stay together unfortunately that extra size creates extra focus on what you're doing from people who want to use your Caravan to push a political message which is what we're seeing right now and so Donald Trump has been talking particularly about sexual assault in the caravans we're gonna take a look at one of his comments on that they're not putting their good ones and remember my opening remarks at Trump Tower or when I opened everybody said all he was so tough and I used the word rape and yesterday it came out where this journey coming up women are raped at levels that nobody has ever seen before they don't want to mention that so I mean he referenced himself one of the first things that we saw of him as a candidate and that video right there and his general messaging about this Caravan I find to be one of the worst things that he's done both the idea that they're not putting their best as if the Mexican government or the Honduran government are they've got trucks and they're like okay are we gonna put on them now that these are people trying to flee from violence and instability that in no small part you can track back to us activities over the past few decades that they're trying to save themselves and their kids and get some sort of better life no they're being sent because they are trash and they don't want them in their own country so they're sending them away and then he talks about the rape there and so there there have been reports by the way saying that the vast vast majority of migrants traveling through Latin America Central America and through Mexico are the targets of various sorts of abuse not in this particular Caravan an embedded reporter says that one of the caravan organizers say that there have been no reports none whatsoever a sexual assault now that doesn't mean that they're necessarily hasn't been any but it doesn't seem like that as a principal problem especially when you consider that one of the principal reasons these are set up is to protect the women and what he's saying there is that those assaults are happening in the caravan they're happening by people in the caravan that these are not people trying to protect themselves though they are potential rapists trying to come into our country and by the way he highlights what he believes to be raped in the caravan not as a reason to help the people but a reason to bar the people from entering our country he says their victims and so screw them they're not getting in here so you mean a man accused by multiple women of sexual harassment and sexual assault is now using sexual assault as a political weapon to dehumanize other people yes I'm shocked yeah look let me dogon him on what both of you just said first of all he apparently doesn't have any problem talking about the concept so look we didn't bring it up he brought it up he was it's not just sexual assault and sexual harassment which are horrific he was accused of rape by his own wife in sworn testimony later she said I didn't mean after they settled and she got the money she was looking for look I'm keeping it real that's what happened that's what happened in the divorce proceedings she said I didn't mean rape in the legal or literal sense what other a sense is there of rape so and he had attacked her ripped her hair out assaulted her and then raped her in one instance because he didn't like the hair transplant doctor that she suggested okay that's the kind of man this is but that is relevant to this story because all he ever does is projection right oh they are the ones doing great like you've never heard before right their government has these evil intentions bad intentions that's why they are putting them in the caravan so he knows I like to do bad things and I want to order things like that's why I assume that's what the government of Mexico and Honduras are doing but it didn't to double down on what John said it has a very camp of the saints feel to it if you don't know the book congratulations it's a horrible racist book from back in the 1970s that has now become the Bible for the all right mark Stein recently talked about it on Fox News Steve Bannon has referred to it over and over and over again Breitbart glowingly refers to it and it is a viciously racist book where immigrants are coming to France 800,000 Indian immigrants and they are referred to in very sexual ways I mean a rivers of sperm they talk about on the book and and here it is Trump talking about it in very these immigrants that are coming that are very sexually oriented etc and and the plot in the book is the immigrants are have a plot they have been sent they have been sent to take over the Western white world and the here of the books job is to murder them all okay that's the thing that they look up to that's why he talks in ways that make no sense because if you break it down and go wait you really think the government of Honduras sit like loaded up at caravan or people that it wasn't that they were fleeing from the violence that happened from the election but that it was a plot by the government of Honduras to do what to send people over to America to do what you would have to be a lunatic to believe in that conspiracy theory and it's because they their frame of mind is from that the immigrants are invading just like they told us in camp of the saints but it's a distraction technique too you know because then anything else that's going negatively for the Trump administration for Americans in the economy you just blame it on the other right you blame it on Muslims you blame it on immigrants wherever they're coming from you blame it on refugees that's the way that Donald Trump became president he used that kind of fear tactic you see it all over the world right now in European nations you see it in Russia too with that kind of nationalism and and you know and that's why he continues to use it because it works like you said you know the right-wing mania Fox so many of those other outlets if you just conjure up this image of a huge caravan of murderers and rapists moving towards the United States and as if we don't have enough security to stop this Caravan before it breaks in then that'll get people afraid of that focused on that and not on or anything else this issue is very close to me my anomaly is my husband and immigrant but my brother-in-law made that trip from Mexico and what they don't understand because they aren't really concerned with what's truly happening is it's not the people who are actually trying to immigrate to America that are raping each other it's usually the people they're hiring to bring them in taking of n yes they're taking advantage of them and you know when we talk about these things we need to start talking about it and also the United States responsibility and what's happening how many coos have we done in South and Central America where people have chosen leaders that would be best for the best interest of the people but yet we are determined to make sure that we have oligarchy regimes in place and they are trying to desperately find a better better mode of life for them and their families you know I've been to Mexico many times I've driven all the way through Mexico down to Puebla and it really that first time I went through with my brother-in-law opened my eyes you know I started thinking about it in real terms and if I was a family and a mother and or someone who is living here and I had these children are these family members what would I do to ensure my family was okay and we are also contributing to what's happening in Mexico we have American companies paying substandard living wages to these people and they don't have real means of being able to provide for their family one person coming to the United States can take care of many family members yeah and that's the humanity part that we seem to forget if we were in their situation what would we be doing people act out of desperation and I just wanted one more thing that I'm sure he gets brought up many times on the show too which is that a lot of the migrants in this Caravan are planning on applying for asylum right they're already being targeted and labeled as illegals by a lot of people on the right and again that kind of language completely just washes away what they're trying to do what they're trying to achieve how they're trying to find themselves a better life yeah I want to talk about a couple things you guys mentioned number one there is a right way to talk about this it's not like rate does not happen in those travels and not in the caravan because that's the whole point of the caravan is to protect everyone that's why they're sticking together but it does happen fairly regularly and it is a tragic story but if to John's point if Trump said look that happens from time to time and it's a tragedy let's figure out how to prevent it we'd be having a really rational conversation about a serious problem instead he put Assizes it and makes it seem like it's the fault of the people who are the victims and and by the way I want to correct something I had stated the caravan is not as big as they claim in and doesn't exist in the way that Trump had said it does it is real Cameron it does happen regularly which then leads to the point that Ilona I said that on earlier shows Ilona pointed out which is that this caravan is now fairly significant about 1,100 people so that part is true ok there you don't sneak in with 1,100 people and and one of the organizers said that's the whole point like we're we're coming here to seek asylum that's why it's super obvious you know you don't do a giant caravan to sneak into the country that's not what we're trying to do yeah yeah according to the organisers they are in fact going to be stopping the journey in Mexico City that is as far as the caravan is going to go it is believed that some a few hundred perhaps will continue to try to get in either through the xylem or other means but they're not going to be trying to move it like the idea that they're going to march hundreds of people in lockstep across the border is ridiculous and then they can like climb on you know help help each other boost them over them exactly yeah but but it's this is Fox News you can literally you can say almost anything that one of the the things that bothers me the most is this this whole feeding frenzy from the right over this issue where this is if you turn into Fox News which you shouldn't or Tucker Carlson especially which shouldn't you'll hear about this randomly throughout the week they love this story it reminds me so much of the discussion when so many Syrians desperately needed our help I know that the right loves to pretend that they think America's great in the left hates America I have this crazy idea that America is strong enough and capable enough that if some Hondurans need our help I think we can help them out I think we could let the minute I think our country would probably be okay at the end of it but they don't think that they think that that would be the end of America and so they need to be stopped and so as Ilona pointed out they are dehumanizing these people they're trying to pretend that these victims are themselves the problems so these people who are abused and raped and assaulted when they're coming here they are the rapists in the same way that the Syrians who are so desperately fleeing terrorists in their home and the regime that was trying to kill them they are the terrorists and thus can't be allowed in and I hesitate to even read this but I want I want to be clear about the language they're using so the border the the National Guard is gonna be deployed to try to stop them and what's gonna happen from that some people say it's just gonna be a visual deterrent and Coulter was asked about that will they just be a visual deterrent she says I don't know we'll see if I were an illegal I mean unless they're going to shoot one and send a message to the rest as Voltaire's line and Candide is we hang one to encourage the others if you shoot one to encourage the others maybe they'll learn but otherwise we'll see we'll see you know what's really striking about this is that we're sending we're talking about sending our troops down to the border for a problem that doesn't even exist but yet these troops should be deployed to Puerto Rico there are so many other problems and ways that our energies need to be diverted in this country and yet we are again at the mercy of a president that right now is acting well I would say he's acting irrationally but I think it's rational in his own mind he is playing to his base and at the expense of human lives and suffering and and we as a country again you know we talk about the refugees and people from other countries but you know I see it from a very different viewpoint that maybe since some others do is that what is America is part and what are they play and why these people are in a situation that they're in we talked about the Syrians or we talked about other people what has been America's part in that if you become a member of the Young Turks you'll be saying you know I'm like a smart person so do it right now ey tea
