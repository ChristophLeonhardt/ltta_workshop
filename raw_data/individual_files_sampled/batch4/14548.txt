for the rebel media I'm answer levan so after the big day after the support demonstration 1500 people after the short court hearing after Tommy meet-and-greet with hundreds of fans I went to a bar just to sit down and catch up on things and Gavin McInnes was there and he pointed across the street and said there's a known jihadi they said well what do you mean by that and he sent me this article from the newspaper and he said that guys outside and I said well there's so many cops out here I feel safe fish and I had actually overheard earlier that police knew a jihadi was in the area so I I knew that things probably would be safe so I walked up to and I said well i'm ashlyn van with the rebel i hear your jihadi are you and here's how that conversation went I my name is Ezra lavance from the rebel media in Canada what's your name aback you are you also go by the name Ricardo mcFarland that used to be your name and can I ask what brought you here today we're here for the Tommy Robinson event yeah Oh something here I mean one of the main reason why come here miss cuttle Allah came here today but one of the main reasons is the challenge tobramycin to debate number one and number two to MMA fight charity fight and I think this is one of the ways you know you know other thing that Tom Robinson's being sincere over the things he's saying I don't think he's been objective I think he's not any academia regarding Islam if another if you wanna talk about Islam you talk about from the us all the foundations and the principles of the religion do you come and say blast off you know because it's not it's not sincere can I ask what your foundations are in Islam my foundations are yeah my foundations come from our soul which is the principles of the religion are you a convert to revert to Islam I'm Arriba yeah may I ask what faith you were born and grew up in oh I was born Muslim even you upon Muslim and I invite everyone here and on fire all of you because how did your parents raise you I was raised as a Christian you know I went to church mu Sundays I went to see my sister's church and I used to go there and because she to leave the church and become a Muslim I realized Islam was the truth and I realized that Islam is superior - yeah can I ask you a question though there's there's different ways to promote Islam there's peaceful ways there's different there's even peaceful Jihad's or struggles and there's violent ways do you support violent ways of jihad well there's no peaceful way of teens ahead is there I mean when you're killing someone it's not it's not peaceful is it you know I've been told that jihad just means struggle and it was possible to have a peaceful struggle it's not not true jihad this as a peaceful struggle I don't know I was told that is that not accurate yeah so in Islam you have something called jihad yeah that's proper that's in Islam does that make this question more relevant to the people if you were do you think it's justified for America to go to war say attack certain countries Iraq giving us Davina's justified I don't know you tell me well it's not justified it's clean so what what should be the retribution on America well I don't believe that America has any more ground to stand on in terms of governments if you look at Donald Trump you know the white one of the first thing he did when he came to office was to kill innocent children he killed and Iraqis you know it's son and he killed his daughter so if what is the proper room and straightaway when you came to power what a thing is here like us there's a difference between the people in governance and the sniffing and the leadership I believe that the leadership in this country I believe that Muslims in general should call for a solution to the hypocrisy of manmade laws in this country because the Sharia is a solution ultimate solution for so but how do we what's the way to get Sharia law in the UK would you enforce it on the pop on the public through through attacks like through do you believe that British soldiers should be attacked because their manifestations of the secular state if I believe this then I wouldn't be here no no yeah I probably need someone to me so where would you be what I'm doing what I'm doing now what I've been doing for the is promoting the Sharia few peaceful means you know speaking about Islam by speaking about the Justice of Islam and also putting down democracy as a hypocrisy so if you don't like democracy do you think who should make the rules who should make the rules Allah who interprets that would you interpret that I said there's a soul if you if you look up the Rasul Allah tops here there's principles in Islam how to how to rule by the area it's not just like you just make up your own laws now I didn't know who you were until a friend said that you were associated with some men who were charged with terrorism is that true interpretation is open to interpretation I'm here to find out the facts as I had never heard of you until an hour ago the BBC associated we have Jimmy Savile yes so what's well going that happens that story icons are still able to propaganda how comes no one's been charged through the BBC with associating my message is very simple I'm a Muslim okay I call for the justice of Islam which is free food clothing and shelter for citizens it's injustice to pay for food it's injustice to work from 9:00 to 8:00 to 9:00 every day 8:00 to 6:00 every day just for just for to pay your rent you know it's to pay for your food I want to ask you a question um the some of the attacks that we've seen in London ray recently on the on the Westminster Bridge on other bridges do you condemn those or do you think that those people have the right idea uh if you look at the 9/11 attacks for example yeah you condemn those it should be easy to do right yeah you have to look at the merits you have to look at things step by step here but how about the innocent people who were on the Westminster Bridge let's look at that we have to do we have to look at their attacks themselves you know 9/11 what did they say I was watching the report as a non-muslim they said I found the possible of the one who did 9/11 at the attack okay but I'm not talking about 9/11 I was talking about here in London yeah mom's gonna say it's use that media is very disingenuous of how the reports are so you don't think of it can I ask you a question I don't trust me me either but I want to ask you a question the Westminster Bridge I was there on the Westminster Bridge shortly after a Muslim revert like yourself got in a car ran down the road and ran down a bunch of civilians of many different backgrounds many of whom were foreign tourists so they weren't even Brits this was last year do you believe that happened or do you believe that's a media propaganda well for the Cova condemned the crimes of Britain and America against Muslims so you won't speak out against that big do is it because you you don't believe it happened it doesn't make sense if someone's if someone's uh if someone comes in and beats up my mama or big sigh my family members here and I'll go and take revenge against that individual yeah and everyone condemns me and doesn't condemn that actual crime that's in place before I finished hypocrisy look up we should look at everything holistically people on the street they had nothing to do with it they'll vanish like Tommy Robinson does he ever is he ever come on the streets and killed my Eddy Edward Heath did has he ever comment recent condemned Theresa May delaying the institutional and pedophilia in the Westminster has he ever done anything for the people of victims of a church just want I don't know if he has evil difficulty focusing on evil Muslims okay now chop - are there any evil Muslims in the UK there are some certain people okay that kudos are Muslims that do evil things either are they're Muslim rape gangs Tommy says there are and and police are prosecuting them do you think that that's a stitch-up do you think there are Muslim rape games in the UK obviously there are people okay that came to be Muslims are doing crimes yeah not disputing that for Wharton Robeson if he's sincere he needs to focus on the people that would in this country they are they are in many parts pedophilia in nature okay they are they have Edward Heath I just wanted to see I hear what you're saying you're saying I don't want to condemn certain acts if I don't condemn other ones but can't you condemn both if if you're critical of the United States for something why can't you also say those innocent pedestrians on Westminster Bridge they were victims of terrorism can't you why why won't you say that because I think that most people of every race and religion would say what was done wrong there what was done there was wrong can't you say that I believe that the media has a narrative for the most efficient not answering me the question every media has an objective as I want to know ask questions and me answer that common I'm a Muslim and I have a bizarre owner and my owner hamdullah supersedes all non-believers in Holmdel are Muslim and I'm superior and more I say ok it's up to me and I don't I don't believe that Muslims should be condemned expense expense of what the attacks on Muslims so you would never condemn a Muslim no matter what he did look at the war in Iraq but you never condemn any Muslims were killed because of the war in Iraq so you would never condemn a Muslim no matter what he did no one camera know I'm on camera private would you in private I might save a Sufis to say to him yeah what kind of things would you say what kind of things would you say to a in private let's say you took a car and ran down a bunch of civilians on Westminster Bridge what would you say to that man in private this is a logical question I don't question because it actually happened it's well that's your opinion so you don't even think it happened you don't even think the Westminster Bridge happened to meet you I don't just a media so you just don't believe it last question what do you think should happen to Tommy Robinson I believe Tom aromasin I believe that he hasn't broken alone if you'll even if good at their law he's he's just reported in the case you know saying there's nothing really that he's broken and I'm saying so from that for if you'll expected you know he should not go to prison but I believe that I should be sincere and and have a proper debate on the issue of what he's talking about because I believe he's instance able for all things you're saying and I believe that if he doesn't want to debate or anything like that you should find me an MMA match I'm here you're an MMA fighter no communion jingling I don't know why that's no comment um do you think that if he hasn't broken any secular law has he broken any Sharia law um yeah it's broken Sharia law which ones what has he done wrong oh that's for me he's some Gus for me sorry since always Islam do you think blasphemy laws should be enforced in the UK sorry do you think blasphemy laws should be enforced in the UK I believe the UK is no Islamic law so it doesn't matter what though they bring you know but do you think that that in the UK someone should be prosecuted for blasphemy if it's not moves to UK for example yet the first Finny's cannot be done is look so add the needs of the people so the few cloven would you do withdraw if the if the UK was under Sharia law what would you do - Tommy Robinson Robinson obviously who'll be charged y'okay with an assignment or it will charged with blasphemy he'll be able to attend quote and then in quote the judge was determined whether he has broken the law or not and what do you think the punishment should be under Sharia law for blasphemy the same punishment as you know killing someone or the same punishment as raping someone the death penalty the same punishment of these things oh let me ask you that so that's if the UK was under Sharia law but as you point out it's under a secular democracy if tomorrow Burton said you know what I have on my hands that's all in the debate Tom Robinson if you put his hand up says no I was wrong about this you know or if anything at the intellectual debate with a knowledgeable Muslim okay on the same things he's saying then 100 a lot you know that's fine what is saying is very provocative and it's very disingenuous can I ask you a few quick questions and I'm gonna get out of you've been very generous your time and I know this other folks you want to talk to you just some quick snappers do you think that do you think that someone who is a homosexual should be allowed to be a teacher in a school said again sir do you think that someone who is gay who's a homosexual should they be allowed to be a teacher in the school in the UK I don't think it makes it let me say it doesn't make sense if someone is I don't think they should be but well the gay people think there is let me speak but I'm not asking about the deeper theory I wanted quick answer should they be allowed to see though because there's a belief that says that you're born gay and I don't believe that makes okay next question should it be against the law to criticise Muhammed sagen should it be against the law to criticise Muhammed like a draw a cartoon of them well days against Allah in Islam and instead oh is it acceptable to commit violence against someone who makes a cartoon of are you interested in the foundations of the Sharia I want to I want to understand who you are cuz I was told you're a jihadist and I want to know the truth GT do you accept the foundation of the Sharia which is free food clothing and shelter for citizens it's a bit more than that it's a Koran do you accept that though I don't I don't know I I have I haven't studied it deeply enough and I'm not interested in that question for right now I want to know if you think that in the UK that violence is acceptable acceptable against people who mock Mohammad who like make a caricature or a cartoon or or say he's a pedophile do you think that that do you think that violence against that is acceptable in that case I'll let you be for example waste you heard this what is it you heard this can you tell me I've heard that and I wanted to find out the truth you would know if you are wanting to tell you I'm a campaigner for the Sharia in the UK have you ever been to Pakistan or Afghanistan or Iraq or Syria no would you ever take up arms for a theocracy like a caliphate what I would say is that the government under at the moment Miami law is a person the people people are committing suicide because I have enough money to eat you're evading all my questions I mean I and this is the main this is the main thing it's like an elephant in the room well but focusing on people that myself etc yeah one last question well last question if someone you knew was gonna join Isis or another terrorist group and go to Syria Iraq or somewhere else if someone said up until I came I'm gonna join my saying your name right if someone said I've another team I'm gonna join Isis or or some other terrorist group and I'm gonna I'm gonna take a SUV and I'm gonna run it down Westminster Bridge would you would you report them to the police it's not a lot it's not a lot for most into reporting almost so much you wouldn't it's not allowed to know that ever happened to you someone ever said to you Abdullah came I'm gonna join and do a terrorist thing no even tell me it's not even something that someone would do well so you're saying it's never happened sorry listen I appreciate your tongue and let you go after game I appreciate your time you don't shake hands with me how come because like am i haram but I'm not a woman you own shit so that's your excuse for her but what's your excuse for me thank you very much for your time you won't shake my hand what is it is it because I'm an infidel well what so the reasons you coming over the agenda I think I'm a villager won't even shake my hand because you won't even shake look yeah okay well I appreciate your time you were generous with your time I'll wave at you then okay bye bye so that's my conversation with Abdul Kareem real name Ricardo as he says a convert to Islam I tried to put him down on things I found him very much like a watermelon seed when you push him down from this side he scoots that side when he put us from down from this side he's scooched that side but I did get a few things out of him I asked him if it should be illegal for there to be teachers who were gay he said that gay isn't even a thing I'll take it that means he doesn't think there should be gay teachers I asked him if he thought it was acceptable to commit violence against those who mock Muhammed and and he said well under Sharia law the punishment would be death I asked him if he had overheard that a friend of his was going to join Isis or another terrorist group would he call police and he said no you don't rat out another Muslim and when I said goodbye to him I reached out my hand to shake his because he was very generous with his time and he put up with hecklers who gathered behind us and he wouldn't shake my hand and then the woman's standing next to me offered theirs I knew he wouldn't shake Bears because I knew that that you know gender apartheid it's a part of his land I didn't know why he wouldn't shake mine it was is it because I'm an infidel I'm not quite sure why but um I don't know what to make of them I know there are 23,000 jihadis in the UK who are being tracked by the police I understand 3,000 attract 24/7 365 I don't know if this guy is one of them but there he is on the streets saying under his way of life under his rule of Sharia law Tommy Robinson wouldn't be on trial for contempt of court he'd be on trial for blaspheming against Mohammed and the punishment would be death for the rebel media I'm Ezra lavance I'm here in the UK for Tommy's second contempt of court trial see all my videos on the subject go to Tommy trial calm you
