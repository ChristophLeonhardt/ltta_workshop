1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,860
This massive show of
North Korean force

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,060
is meant to inspire
postcards,

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,760
not paranoia.

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,230
Troops and construction
workers gathered in June

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,600
to celebrate a new, sprawling
tourist destination

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,340
on the coast of Wonsan,

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,590
about two and a half
hours from Pyongyang.

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,060
But Wonsan is known for
more than sand beaches

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,440
and sunshine.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,184
The North Korean regime
runs an air base in Wonsan

11
00:00:30,184 --> 00:00:31,790
and it’s from here
that it planned

12
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,060
to launch missiles capable of
striking U.S. military targets

13
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,680
in Japan and Guam.

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,430
Live fire drills were conducted
here as recently as 2017.

15
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,700
That didn’t stop President Trump,

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,190
a former real estate
developer,

17
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:47,540
from spotting the potential.

18
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,650
“Whenever they’re exploding
their cannons into the ocean, right —

19
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,800
I said, ‘Boy, look at that view,
wouldn’t that make a great condo?’

20
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,510
And I explained, I said,
‘You know, instead of doing that,

21
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,260
you could have the best hotels
in the world right there.’”

22
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,450
Kim Jong-un was
already on the case.

23
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,580
In his 2018 New Year’s address,

24
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,549
he made those beach
condos a priority.

25
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,200
Satellite images
and other photos

26
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,810
reveal that the coastline has
been under heavy construction

27
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,130
since January,

28
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,140
even at night.

29
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,930
We see how these 
two missile launchpads

30
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,440
have given way to rows upon rows
of beachfront buildings.

31
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,440
Here on the left,

32
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,170
we see the beach
lined with artillery

33
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,900
for military drill in 2017.

34
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,620
And on the right, is the
same strip of land in 2018.

35
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:43,710
Construction of a tourism
destination is in full swing.

36
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,980
The project has at least
150 buildings, some as high

37
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,200
as 12 stories.

38
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,870
Pyongyang said
that the tourist zone

39
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:54,390
should attract at least one
million visitors per year.

40
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,080
But in a country
synonymous with

41
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,570
prison camps, purges, and
extreme poverty,

42
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,980
it is unclear where these
tourists will come from.

43
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,350
Yet the hope seems to be
that condos and cabanas

44
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,170
will get the cash flowing.

45
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,960
During a visit
to North Korea in May,

46
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,286
Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo said Americans

47
00:02:10,286 --> 00:02:11,310
could help with that.

48
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,914
“Here is what this
will look like:

49
00:02:12,914 --> 00:02:14,780
This will be Americans
coming in —

50
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,190
private sector Americans,
not the U.S. taxpayer —

51
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,300
coming in to help build out
the energy grid,

52
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,330
to work with them
to develop infrastructure.”

53
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,450
And that same week photos of
Kim visiting

54
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,820
the construction site
were published.

55
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,820
The North Korea of flashy
skyscrapers and shiny holiday

56
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,670
resorts that Trump showed
Kim in this inspirational video

57
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,840
at the
Singapore summit

58
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,370
might still be a way off.

59
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,880
“A new world can begin today,

60
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,170
where the doors of opportunity
are ready to be opened.”

61
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,510
But if Kim gives up
bombs for beaches,

62
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,430
it might be time to
reach for sunblock

63
00:02:45,430 --> 00:00:00,000
instead of sanctions.
