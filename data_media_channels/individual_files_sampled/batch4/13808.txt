your life if you were suicidal she's long been known as somebody who you would certainly believe where she to make any and every claim at least that's how the media are treating her these days in the media that hated Omarosa up until let's see 37 seconds ago now they think that she has tons of credibility to speak about who president trumpets the lady who on tape two years ago was saying everyone would be forced to bow before President Trump that is not a paraphrase that is a direct quote he said the people would be forced to kneel before Zod right that lady now is saying that she is sorry she was ever part of these odd regime and she feels quite terrible that she flew with Zod out of the for bit of the out of the mirror Forbidden Zone and now she is she is very sorry and wishes abjectly Lee to beg apology of you and to remind you the President Trump is in fact a vicious and brutal racist so she says that she has all sorts of Trump tapes and she now says that there is a a production staff member on the apprentice who wants to drop tapes of President Trump using the n-word now if this sounds like deja vu that's because it is we had this exact discussion back in 2016 there were rumors that there were tapes from the set of The Apprentice where Donald Trump was using the n-word and none of those ever came forth there's a lot of talk about whether Mark Burnett who's the producer of The Apprentice was hiding those tapes or whether he was just friends with Trump and didn't want those tapes to get out well now Omarosa is resurfacing those rumors and she says that there is indeed a staff member who wants to wait till October to drop those tapes if those tapes were to drop it obviously would be a major problem for the president not because I think his base of support would dissipate I think people who are loyal to Trump are loyal to Trump through thick and thin but because all of the stuff that people have said is racially charged would suddenly look very different if the president habitually uses the advert right the president habitually uses racist slurs then all the stuff that feels racially charged or racially tinged suddenly shifts over into the category of probably racist but is that tape out there well there's no evidence that tape actually is out there nonetheless Omarosa is pushing this and Chris Matthews around hi Bob very eager to hear about it yup in the morning tell me they show Ron in here talk about racism Omarosa I hate but now I love her because she's saying bad stuff about Trump Chris Matthews I'm a rough cow I believe that they're using it for politically motivated things in fact they may be for November before November and they saw it on it took it on themselves to actually document this so that they could actually expose him for the races that he is okay so now I'ma Rossa says that he's a racist she shoes out there the entire campaign talk about what an honor Trump was she gets fired because she's a terrible employee and then she leaves the White House and suddenly Trump is a racist if this feels a little bit as though she is turning and wheeling on Trump because she's mad at him that's because that's exactly what this is so president Trump is in his own inimitable fashion takes to Twitter to respond because this is the reality show we all bargain for okay let's be real about this this is what you wanted to see was it not when you turned into The Apprentice this is what you wanted to see you are getting the show that you took that remote control and decided to TiVo and now you're getting to enjoy it break out the popcorn break out the jelly beans because this is how it's going to go from here until the end of the administration President Trump tweets out this Mark Burnett he calls to say there are no tapes of The Apprentice where I used such a terrible and disgusting word as attributed by wacky and deranged amarosa so I like that every day now actually hurt her nickname expands so she started off as wacky Omarosa she's now wacky and deranged Rama Rosa tomorrow Oh be wacky deranged and insane Omarosa so she's sort of like in Austrian Prince just adds names as time continues just it's her Trump continues I don't have that word in my vocabulary and never had she made it up look at her many recent quotes saying such wonderful and powerful things about me a true champion of civil rights until she got fired Omarosa had zero credibility with the media they didn't want interviews when she worked in the White House now that she says bad about me they will talk to her fake news here's the thing Trump's actually right about this obviously the media hated Amuro so they thought that it was a joke shoes in the White House because it was a joke that she was in the White House because she never should have been hired because the president didn't hire all the best people he hired Omarosa of all the people in the United States he went hire Omarosa but when he says that the media are treating Omarosa with a strange new respect that of course is a hundred percent true then he says when you give a crazed crying lowlife a break and give her a job at the White House I guess it just didn't work out good work by general Kelly for firing quickly firing that Doug okay so some people today are saying oh it's racist racist the Trump would call her a dog right he calls her a crazed crying lowlife and says he gave her a break I liked it for President Trump every time he hires somebody it's that he gave them their big break in life it's a out of the charity of his heart he hired because he's such a charitable fellow president trumpets that's what he does he's just such a nice guy okay but the idea that he's a racist because he called Omarosa a dog is just silly here is a mere smattering of the people he has called the dog in the past on Twitter alone okay and it's always in the same context he loves the phrase fired like a dog which begs the question how many dogs has he actually fired cuz that's weird like do you fire a dog our dog's known for being fired it's a strange from the phrase but the president has said this many many times so here's what he said about David Gregory formerly of NBC David Gregory got thrown off of TV by NBC fired like a Doug now he's on CNN being nasty to me not nice exclamation point Mitt Romney had his chance to be a failed president but he choked like a dog I don't know what he has against dogs like I'm not a dog person but he needs to go over to like puppy spot or something and really get to know some dogs because he's kind of mean he says Moo McMiller I'm now going to teach you a big boy a lesson about lawsuit in finance you ungrateful Doug Minnie says about sloppy Steve ban and this is my favorite cuz I don't like so you ban he's a jerk he's now sloppy steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone and then there's bill maher fired like doug and then there's Arianna Huffington she is a Doug who wrongfully comments on me and then there's Reverend Wright and Barack Obama he says the Reverend Wright was dumped like a dog and then there's eric erickson who was fired like a dog and then there's reverend wright who was also again dumped like a dog and then there was glenn back who was burned like a dog and then there was David Axelrod who was a dog and then there's George Will who was thrown off ABC like a dog and then there was Chuck Todd who was not quite fired like a dog but Trump thought he was going to be fired like a dog and there was brent bozell who came to his office begging for money like a dog and then there's eric erickson again fired like a dog and then mubarak who was dropped like a dog there was Ted Cruz who scapegoated his capable director of communications fired like Doug and finally the best one involves of course this this is a classic of the genre fired like a dog I mean it's a whole genre right if Blockbuster Video still existed there would actually be a full section of dog references by President Trump be like fired like a dog one fired like a dog to the revenge okay so he's waited this is this is the it's the best one this is from October 17th 2012 Robert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart she cheated on him like a dog and would do it again just watch he can do much better so Before we jump to he's a racist we might want to say he's a speciesist he doesn't like dogs he's very very mean to dogs you thought Mitt Romney was mean to dogs when he put a dog on top of his car and drove around all that stuff President Trump every time he has something bad to say about a person he likens that person into a dog so there's that but I love that the BDI are treating he called home roses oh he's a racist because she's a black woman that's why he calls her a dog no I called her dogs doesn't like her and for some reason he's got this phrase stuck in this said one of the one of the funny things about you know delving into Trump's Twitter is whenever you think that he's tweeted something that is brand new as soon as you delve into his past you realize that he has said it 1,000 times before we've had this sort of thing with President Trump before so I remember when he did this thing where he mocked Sergey Kowalewski who was a columnist for The New York Times and remember he did these hand motions that made it look like he was mocking a disabled reporter and this became a statement repeatedly that he was mocking the disabled reporter not just mocking the disabled reporter but mocking him for the disability any ideas that he was doing it because he knew Kowalewski was disabled and so he started doing his hands in in sort of a curled up fashion in order to mock Kowalewski x' to scoop disability and then it turns out that if you go back through his tapes of him mocking people he's constantly doing these weird hand motions every time he refers to somebody he doesn't like so is he mocking the reporter yes was he doing it for the disability no the truth is that one of the reasons people give Trump a lot of leeway on him being a jerk is good is a jerk to everybody but I'm surprised that we're still fighting this fight like he's constantly a jerk to most the president has two categories in life when it comes to the people he deals with either they're wonderful people who say great things about me and therefore deserve jobs at the White House no matter how bad they are at their job or they should be fired like a Doug because they're the worst people in the world right and everything breaks down into these two categories is that the president has any forty magda plan like when he's nice to Putin he's not nice to Putin because Putin and Trump were on the phone late at night making sweet love to one another it wasn't that it's that Putin has said in the past you've got a strong month but I have been pump and then Trump's like I like that guy it's great and then the minute the Putin does something Trump doesn't like you should be fired like a Doug that's that's really it's it's those are the only two polls for president Trump yeah and that's that is what it is like is it my favorite thing no but are we getting exactly what we bargained for of course we're getting exactly what we bargained for okay but the media are responding to all of this with the predictable outrage that you knew that they would we'll get to that in just one second first let's talk about the fact that you have a credit card bills let's talk about the fact you have some outstanding costs that you want to pay or you want to do some construction on your house bottom line is you need some sort of swing loan and with Lending Club you can do all the stuff you can top consolidate your debt or pay off credit cards with

she apparently had a little pen that had in it a recording device okay this is the latest accusation how was she recording this stuff she wasn't using her phone is the accusation by a Shara Lee over at over on Twitter calm he's a reporter and he suggests that she was carrying around a pen that recorded things the great irony of this of course is that as you recall back during the 2016 election Corey Lewandowski grabbed a reporter named Michelle fields because she might have had a little pen bomb it turns out that the pen bomb it was actually a pen recording device and it was carried James bond-like by Omarosa into the West Wing because everything is stupid because all that you see this pen you never know you never know gang what's in this pit in any case she claims that she has Trump on tape doing all sorts of terrible things here is the most damning material this is she gave the tape to CBS apparently she was talking with Katrina Pierson who was a once and future member of the Trump team and Katrina page was talking about the supposed n-word tape that was floating around the offices of The Apprentice or somesuch and here is Omarosa talking with Katrina Pierson because our long national nightmare of people who shouldn't be on TV never ends here we go okay so hatred s Katrina Pierson the very end saying he said it he said the n-word and he is embarrassed okay well we don't actually have evidence that any of this was said when the evidence comes out then we'll have to talk about the implications for the administration left to talk about the implications for future electoral prospects the the kind of national implications of having a president who has used the n-word in the last 10 years if that ends up being a thing that actually happened but if the best that amorosa can do is come up with a comment from Katrina Pierson that's going to be pretty weak sauce that's that's pretty weak sauce remember Katrina Pierson is a person who worked for Ted Cruz then worked for President Trump and then suggested it was okay when President Trump implied that via national via the National Enquirer that Katrina Pearson had an affair with Ted Cruz none of these people are real high on the credibility list none of these people really like you wouldn't trust them to handle your finances like III really honest to god I would not trust these people to handle my safety deposit box and I'm supposed to believe that they have all of the all of the goods on on president Trump or that I'm supposed to trust President Trump here's my view when I can't trust anybody have to wait for evidence to come out otherwise this is just a bunch of media nonsense there's a reason by the way that amaurosis book still hasn't reached number one on Amazon it's because nobody believes anything she has to say even members of the media are looking at her and saying yeah this this is not the Spree weak stuff like there's pretty weak stuff okay so now I want to talk in brief about the the Muller investigation so this is hysterically funny Peter struck you'll recall is the charming and wonderfully smug fellow who appeared before Congress recently to talk about why he was such a good guy he's such a good guy that Peter struck sent text messages to his lover both of them were married to other people at the time about why he didn't want President Trump to be President he said he would stop President Trump for being president in at that time he was leading both the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the Russia investigation which begs the question or at least it prompts the question as to was there only one employee at the FBI like could they actually have hired somebody else to do something over there apparently Peter struck was the entire show in any case Peter struck was texting about why Trump shouldn't be president at the same time he was investigating both presidential candidates that it turns out is bad policy well struck was fired yesterday from the FBI he was fired because of those texts and because the Inspector General of the DOJ in his report found that he could not actually credibly clear struck of accusations of bias he didn't know exactly how strux bias had affected the investigation and he'd have to investigate that further but struck had to go so what instructed the struck gets fired and then his lawyer releases a statement saying that this is a political hit here is Struck's lawyer from Vancouver Island apparently doing this via Skype because only the best and here he is on NBC News talking about why this is a political hit I don't think that you can rationally reach any conclusion other than it was political it's difficult to believe given the steady drumbeat of text demonizing Pete from the president and all the calls on Capitol Hill by Republicans for Pete to be fired that that didn't play a role okay the reason he was fired is because the IG report said that Struck's texts quote potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations the IG report also said that Struck's behavior was quote not only indicative of a bias State of Mind but even more seriously implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidates electoral prospects the report also found that strux decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over the Hillary investigation could have been biased it said quote under these circumstances we did not have confidence that Struck's decision to prioritize the Russian investigation over following up on the mid-year related investigative lead that's the Hillary related investigative lead the Weiner computer was free from bias the report concluded strux activities were quote antithetical to the core values of the FBI and the DOJ hard to claim that that is a political firing when the Inspector General of the DOJ is openly saying that this guy basically destroyed any credibility he ever had okay so what instruct you after he was fired the first thing he did because this is the stupid world we live in now Peter struck immediately once you go fund me no I am not kidding and then he started a GoFundMe to fund for his legal bills even though he does not actually have legal bills within 24 hours he had raised over a quarter million dollars for his legal-defense fund because everything is stupid so I just want to point out how dumb Democrats and leftists who are doing this are in the last two years they've made heroes out of James Comey a man who undermined the credibility of the FBI and may very well have gotten Donald Trump elected remember it was James comers reopening of the investigation into Hillary Clinton a week before the election that may have sunk her in the swing states just enough that she loses the election they've made him into a hero right he is the leader of the resistance now now they're making Omarosa into the leader of the resistance they've made Michael avenatti a legitimate presidential candidate the lawyer for a porn star they've made him a legitimate presidential candidate based on the fact that his clients want heads once had sex with Trump during Shark Week like that that is it legitimately they're making Michael avenatti he's now running for president he's in Iowa right now organizing seriously they're not polling on him by the way he'll win a primary okay Michael having out he runs he will win a primary because this is what Democrats are now he's a more interesting and exciting kans in it than Kamala Harris okay and and now they're also making a hero out of Peter struck who's complete battery of the Trump and Hillary investigations also probably led to Trump being elected remember the only reason that Hillary Clinton's investigation was reopened that close to the election even though the FBI knew about weiners laptop in late September is because Peter struck decided Aurra ties the russia investigation over the hillary investigation and then by the time they got around to looking at the hillary stuff it was week before the election a to reopen it so the democrats are now raising money for james comey and peter struck two of the people that hillary clinton i think has the most right to blame for her gigantic electoral failure so well done democrats you guys are just you're on top of it you're just on top of it raising money for Peter struck I'm sure he will use it to pad his latest love nest with the person he is not married to he's just a delight my goodness okay but don't worry things get even stupider they get even stupider just wait we're gonna talk about all the stupidity first we need to talk about your skill set so you don't want to be one of these stupid people you know one won't be one of these people who's chief qualification for being on TV is that you once brought a pen into the West Wing you want to be somebody who actually has a skill set to share and one of the ways that

so as I say things get even stupider than Peter struck starting a GoFundMe how how could they possibly get stupider you ask aha I'm so glad you asked here's how they get stupider Roger stone is now being investigated by the Muller investigation so the Muller investigation is looking at Roger stone why because Roger stone was a go-between for WikiLeaks right he was hanging out with the WikiLeaks folks they're a bunch of direct messages between him and WikiLeaks WikiLeaks of course turns out to be a Russian front group coordinating closely with the Russian government in the release of Hillary Clinton's emails so now the Muller investigation is looking at whether maybe Roger stone was working with WikiLeaks to funnel extra information from Hillary Clinton's hacked emails to the Trump campaign that's basically what they are looking at well The Daily Caller is reporting that Roger stone is is now the target of the witch-hunt and Roger stone who is legitimately just a dummy I mean really how do I know that Roger stone is a dummy you know the guy with the giant tattoo of Nixon on his back well there's that we can start with the giant tattoo of Nixon on his back but then there is also the fact that he tweeted out today today a graphic I'm not kidding about this again I have to ask him clarifying that I'm not kidding because if you had told me this is what politics was gonna be like when I got into it I definitely would have gone I would have gone and continued playing in a string quartet like really he tweeted this out and you actually put this out on Instagram okay it is a picture of Sean Hannity Mike Pence Sarah Huckabee Sanders Roger stone Devon Nunez Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani wearing uniforms that look like astronauts and then it says blow it space force in space no one can hear you why they are all wearing patches in these uniforms of swastikas swastikas with a little rocket and Roger stone put the census I love this proud to be in this crew but the only wise being told are by liberal scumbags now why you ask would Roger stone tweet out a picture of himself wearing a swastika along with other members of the Trump administration and Sean Hannity because he's stupid that's the answer the answer is because he's a dum-dum Sir Roger stone has an op ed over at the Daily Caller about why he is the target of the witch hunt one of stones rules he says is the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about even I may have taken exception to that rule last Friday again only the best people only the best people were associated with the term campaign and the reason this is irritating folks is because all of this is easily avoidable and continues to be easily avoidable but we're not going to avoid it we're gonna steer directly into this crap storm he says if you followed the news last Friday you know that my longtime friend Kristin Davis testified before special counsel Robert Mullins grand jury and my longtime associate and wingman Andrew Miller was held in contempt for his refusal to testify for the grand jury that a subpoena was dropped on Randi cretak oh who despite his public denials was the source who first told me that WikiLeaks had the goods on Hillary and would release them in October it was a deep state trifecta Andrew Miller's contempt citation is a bit more complicated his appeal may be problematic for Muller down the road Muller is running a criminal II abusive constitutionally unaccountable professionally and politically incestuous conspiracy of ethically conflicted cronies colluding to violate my fourth fifth sixth amendment rights and those of almost everyone who had any sort of political or personal association with me in the last ten years he has conducted a supposedly comprehensive investigation of a very narrow and limited issue as an open-ended totally limit limitless grand prosecution with absolutely no articulable or even identifiable criminal predicates to substantiate it as a lawful investigation even under ordinary circumstances well I mean they did brag that you were like best friends with WikiLeaks I mean there was that and then you also bragged about how you were tight with Trump so there's that as well and again maybe Muller finds nothing but the the grand prosecution how dare they target me Roger stone I am clean as know okay so here he continues he says Muller's team of partisan prosecutors seeks to prove the unprovable that I received allegedly hacked emails from the Russians or WikiLeaks and passed them on to Donald Trump this threadbare false narrative is harped on endlessly by slugs at MSNBC and other despicable fake news outlets now because of the accuracy of my tweets in which I merely followed the tweets of WikiLeaks and the many public interviews of WikiLeaks publisher you Julian Assange Muller and his hitmen seek to frame some motocross charge of defrauding the United States this of course is based on a false and unproven assumption that Assange is a Russian agent and WikiLeaks is a Russian front neither of which has been proven in a court of law okay so if his defense that WikiLeaks is not a Russian front good luck with that one good luck with that one because it turns out the high level of coordination between WikiLeaks in the Russian government is obvious to anyone who spent any time looking at this issue again he maintains that that WikiLeaks is some sort of independent agency now maybe all this comes to nothing but the fact that Roger stone is now being dragged into all of this demonstrates that the campaign had serious problems from the very start now should any of this really impact the presidency should any of this really be of any sort of consequence to the Trump presidency I don't think so I really don't think that any of this ends up being a big deal in the end that said I do think that things have become so stupid on every side that it's diff to tell what is real from what is not I want to say stupid on every side I mean the the left perception of this case is just as stupid so the Washington Post editorial board for example they say the only way for us to really believe that anyone is innocent in this case is for Trump to talk directly with Robert Muller and they write this whole editorial saying there's no need to fear Muller mr. president if you've nothing to hide of course that's not true okay as a lawyer that's not true the first rule of wiring is tell your client to shut his face really that is the first rule of any sort of criminal lawyer ring shut your head don't talk okay if it doesn't matter if you're innocent doesn't matter if you're guilty do not talk to the cops it's actually the first rule of wiring if they see you as a potential defendant because all you can do is give them evidence that is going to either lead them down the path toward prosecuting you or is going to lead them to look into you more closely all right the fact is that if you want to convey something to the police you can always do so through a lawyer but if the police are bringing you in for an investigation the chances that they're going to be asking you a bunch of questions to exonerate you is probably close to nil right it's pretty low and that's particularly true when you are talking about a political politically oriented prosecution like Muller this idea that Trump should get in a room with Robert Muller and that he has no risk at all if he just tells the truth first of all Trump is a pathological problem with telling the straight truth right the guy exaggerates on a regular basis and having being a lawyer means taking things both literally and seriously the case that's been made for Trump is that you are supposed to take things seriously but not literally okay that's a fair case Selina Zito has made it Abele the idea that when Trump says stuff we all just kind of go yeah he's exaggerating but we know what he means right but we know what he means in lawyer land but we know what he means is not natural defense in lawyer land what you say is literally what you say and we take it at face value and that means that they'd be fools to actually put Trump in a room with Robert Muller but the Washington Post really wants it they say this silly game has gone on far too long the country was attacked mr. Muller is trying to determine what happened the president should be eager to help the country learn and move on instead his lawyers have spent the summer hemming and hawing about the right circumstances for an interview I don't remember the same sort of the same sort of mitigating feelings from the Washington Post with regard to president Trump testifying let's say this summer has brought increasingly dire reminders that Russia interfered with 20 election and that it intends to continue meddling in the country's democracy if mr. Trump has done nothing wrong and intends to tell the truth he should welcome mr. Mullins questioning and do everything possible to hasten the special counsels final report ok this is the same argument that if you have nothing to hide from the police and they should be able to put a camera in your house if you have nothing to worry about criminally there's no reason you shouldn't allow the police to simply search your premises at any time the whole point of restricting Authority is that authority can be abused and we don't necessarily have to we don't necessarily have to assume guilt in order to assume that that authority can be used to go after folks and that that's generally been true ok in just a second I want to talk about why exactly would be foolish for the President to actually get in front of Muller with some examples of President Trump being President Trump because he continues to be President Trump which has upsides and it has downsides but first you're going to have to go over to Daily wire calm first let me announce let me remind you

States if everything feels chaotic it's because everything just feels chaotic and it's it's highly irritating it's gotta stop none of it is very helpful the president has news cycles from here to the end of time that are that are quite good for him I think the economy is doing well we don't have any major foreign crises these this is one of the things I keep emphasizing if the president would just stay out of the news everything would be better every time the president goes abroad and the media doesn't have anything to do but fulminate over over nothing his approval ratings go up instead the president has a nasty habit of allowing his aide to dominate how he approaches politics and that makes it very hard for his fellow Congress the Republican Congress people to get elected I talked to Republicans who are running in races across the country on a routine basis and the biggest single problem they have is that every election is no longer a referendum on them it's a referendum on President Trump and president Trump is not popular in a lot of swing districts so for all the talk about Trump being litmus test for Republicans I know a lot of Republicans are enthusiastic about that because Trump won in 2016 2016 you may notice on the calendar is not the same date as 2018 nor is it the same date as 2020 what the president does actually matters and so when the president is petty or when the president gets into Twitter space with Omarosa or when the president is just musing about struck and page and all the rest of the stuff is any of this stuff dramatically helpful no it's not an example yesterday of just just how unhelpful this is so president Trump he was announcing a win for him okay it is the John McCain National Defense Authorization Act it is a massive increase in defense spending that is a good thing that is a win it's something that he has touted for a very long time all he has to do for the headline to be good is just be a normal human like a normal decent human John McCain as much as president Trump doesn't like John McCain is indeed an American Hero hey John McCain underwent torture by the Vietcong for years anytime and then when he was offered his release he refused his release on the grounds that he didn't want to leave his guys behind for that alone John McCain anism is an American Hero forget all of the Senate service forget what you think about his politics that was heroic stuff and he has always been a strong advocate for the National Defense community so there's his bill it's called the John s McCain National Defense Authorization here was president Trump announcing the bill you'll notice something missing in this announcement in a few moments in honor of that sacred obligation I will put my signature on the National Defense Authorization Act this authorization will give America's war fighters the firepower they need to win any conflict quickly and decisively yeah all of that's fine except for him completely ignoring the name of the Act he just completely ignores the name of the Act and so people jumped on this as well they should because it's kind of a garbagey thing to do hey John McCain was one of the forces behind this act and then later he mocked McCain in front of a crowd well basically signing bill come on we got rid of the individual mandate which is the most everything but as you know one of our one of our wonderful senators said thumbs down at two o'clock in the morning okay so there he is mocking McCain the same day listen it's fine to mount McCain for his political activity but ignoring his name in the defense authorization bill is kind of a it's kind of a crappy move and this is the biggest problem for president Trump really he doesn't know his friends from his enemies he doesn't know the people who want him to succeed from the people who don't want him to succeed okay the fact is that he may not like John McCain but when it comes to smacking John McCain is that really an important thing for him to be doing or should he be saving his firepower for people who actually deserve it so that was some bad trim now here's some good Trump right here's President Trump going after Andrew Cuomo know Andrew Cuomo deserves every bit of scorn the president can utilize against him if president from leverages his fire against Andrew Cuomo that is a valid use of time so here is the president doing the right thing by attacking somebody who ought to be attacked Cuomo wants to take away your Second Amendment now he called me and he said I'll never run for president against you but maybe he wants to oh please do it he did say that did that maybe maybe he mentioned the one thing we know and they do say anybody that runs against Trump suffers yeah this is the part of Trump that's actually first of all it's very funny but second of all this is the part of Trump that's actually useful him attacking Democrats is useful him attacking people who are actively you know trying to run against him that's a useful thing what is not a useful thing is all the distractions is all the foolishness with with Omarosa yeah there's been this take on President Trump all along they get the good along with the bad and that works until it doesn't it works until it doesn't people say well it helped him win in 2016 it did help him win in 2016 but you know what he lost the popular vote by three million and he barely won the election in the electoral college right he won three states by 80,000 combined votes and if you think that the same formula is necessarily going to allow you to win in 2020 even as you've doubled down on all the qualities that may be unpopular in the first place I am skeptical I'm just skeptical now maybe Trump pulls it out right Trump is very good at pulling his opponents down into the mud this is what he's best at and that's valid and that's useful but if the president could get even a little bit more disciplined he'd have a much better shot of maintaining Congress maintaining the Senate maintaining the presidency if we lose the Congress the Senate in the presidency by 2020 people gonna look back and say well maybe all of that the good comes along with the bad stuff maybe it would've been better if we just gotten the good and not gotten a lot of the bad I don't see why that's out of the realm of possibility or why that is being hypercritical with the president I really don't think that it is now speaking of Cuomo's who stink Chris Cuomo on CNN made a statement yesterday that is just astonishing so as you've been following we talked about it yesterday be fizzled all right rally in Charlottesville 25 people showed up and then Antipa showed up by the hundreds and proceeded to attack some members of an Tifa proceeded to attack the police they were walking around chanting no no borders no wall no USA at all really just wonderful wonderful folks antiva going all the way back to 2016 before Trump was president the DHS the Department of Homeland Security was suggesting that ante foe was actually a threat to security across the country at events across the country yet the media have been propping them up and for all the talk about how the right needs disassociate from the alt-right how the right needs to basically disassociate from folks like Cory Stewart in Virginia and I think there's a lot of validity to that I think Corey Stewart has been race baiting for for no reason other than political gain and it's gross in Virginia for all the talk about how the right needs to get rid of the Steve bannon's and they need to get rid of the the kind of alt right soft players in the in the right wing movement the left has embraced ante fits you far more of an extent than the right currently embraces they all right there's just no question about this and the latest proof of this is Chris Cuomo who legitimately cannot bring himself to condemn antiva a violent terrorist group in the United States here is here's Chris Cuomo who is I mean it's unbelievable to say this because the less bright Cuomo I didn't I didn't know that was possible it here's Chris Cuomo actually saying on CNN that there is no moral equivalency between the Nazis and nt4 between the alt-right and anti feh here's the argument if you're a punk who comes to start trouble in a mask and hurt people you're not about any virtuous cause you're just somebody who's gonna be held to the standard of doing something wrong but when someone comes to call out bigots and it gets hot even physical are they equally wrong as the bigot they are fighting I argue no okay so he argues that an Tifa is not as bad as the alt writers ignoring the fact that 94 walks around chatting about how all cops are racist and how the system has to be torn down about how the United States should not exist okay it is exactly this perspective on the part of the mainstream left that will lead to increased violence really it will lead to the the belief that the mainstreaming of violence is okay you label your opponents Nazis and then you go out and you protest them how do I know because an see if I actually tried to do the same thing at an actual speech that I was giving okay I was the number one target of the alt-right in 2016 there was no mother has been no more vocal voice against the alt-right in the United States than me okay I've been doing this for years ripping on them consistently and yet an Tifa was there at Berkeley trying to shut down my speech okay but corn Chris Cuomo they're just nice people right they're just trying to fight the fascism the reality is that antenna is an anarchist communist at group there's sort of a narco communists and they have been pushing their radical politics for a while using violence going all the way back really to the sort of the World Trade Organization protests in the 90s there's a long lasting movement that spans from the WTO through Occupy Wall Street and now forward to an Tifa is all part of wave on the left and the fact that the left still sees these people as fighting on the beaches of Normandy is astonishing remember Chris Cuomo is the same idiot who when an Tifa actually got violent tweeted out a picture of the beaches at Normandy of our guys getting off the beaches at Normandy and said here's another group of anti-fascist fighting a group of fascists and is like wait a second so your suggestion is that number one American citizens exercising their right to free speech in the wrong cause is the same as Nazis who legitimately invaded several countries and perpetrated the Holocaust got a problem with that because why we have law enforcement in the United States to prevent bad stuff from happening second of all if you really think that these idiot anarchists who are throwing bottles at cops are the same thing as American soldiers getting off the boats at Normandy to fight Nazis you're out of your mind there were no white supremacist who showed up two days ago 20 of them but there are hundreds of Antipa members who are getting violent shouting ridiculous things and yet the media are defending them because the media has embraced full-scale the reactionary politics that makes this country ugly they've embraced it and this is what we are now seeing we are seeing politics ping-ponging forth back and forth between two reactionary points of view you want to know how things actually get violent you won't know how a peaceful country or a country that has a functioning democracy devolves into violence and sectarianism the way it happens is you feel that your group is threatened by an out-group and so you start pursuing ever more radical methods of fighting that out group and in response the out group feels threatened by you and they start pursuing ever more radical politics and violence as well that's how things spiral out of control and Chris Cuomo and folks like him who are pushing an Tifa are only promoting that they're only helping that case it's really dangerous they're playing with fire here they're playing if they had any sense and actually look back at the history of Nazi Germany and pre Nazi Germany what they would have to recognize is that one of the things that led to the rise of the Nazis was the fact that there were actual near daily street fights between communists and brown shirts on the streets of pre Nazi Germany on the streets of the vemma republic that led to the rise of the Nazi government that really is a deep part of the history of the media wish to ignore simply because they want to claim that everybody on the right is evil or anyone tangentially associated with the right is is a Nazi but everybody on the left is actually good and Noble and virtuous okay time for some things I like and then we'll do things that I hate so things that I like Greg Gutfeld does a great job over on the five and he has a brand new book called the gutfeld monologues he has an essay at the very beginning that's really telling because gutfeld took the same position I did in the 2016 election he didn't vote for either of the candidates and he talks about why that was what has changed what his view is on President Trump and then what he does he takes a lot of his old monologues and he does something that's really worthwhile something I think that most commentators actually should do he takes a lot of his old writings then he critiques his own his own writings now this is something that I did recently on The Daily wire when I was you know criticized for some stuff I'd written in the past I felt like okay well you know what why don't I go back and actually see if that stuff was bad or if it was good and it turns out something it was bad and so it was good you know I would say the vast majority of what I've written over the course of my career I'm proud of but there's certain things that I've written that are just garbage and Gutfeld does the same thing in the Gutfeld monologues it's worth reading it's a fun read I think this number 5 on the Wall Street Journal bestseller list this week so go check it out they got fill monologues with by by Greg Gutfeld Greg's also a really good guy so go check that out a really really nice guy okay time for let's do some let's do a bunch of stuff that I hate like a lot of it so this is just amazing and also amusing I don't know whether I like this whether I hate this and it's sort of a deconstruction of the culture so there's a new show on CW about bat woman that woman right not Batgirl bat woman Batgirl is is Commissioner Gordon's daughter that woman is the is a police officer I guess like a former police officer I remember her back story who ends up fighting crime alongside Batman in the new 52 comics which were released what in the last decade or so in the new 52 series they made her lesbian because when they launched new 52 they decided they were gonna go broad scale diverse so everybody was going to be a Muslim or black or gay because they wanted a broader spectrum of characters who are not all white straight people that's their creative decision I would suggest that that creativity was drawn was was pushed less by character and necessity than it was by a desire to be politically correct if you read a lot of the new 52 comics have been critical of them for years because they've attempted to leverage left politics into comic books in matters ranging from immigration to sexuality they've had full comic books were Superman is is fighting the is basically a member of an Tifa the police so remember black lives matter the new 52 has become very very much to the left in any case the character of that woman has been a lesbian in the new 52 for probably a decade close to a decade and now they're making a series on CW about bat woman and so she is a lesbian of course now we'll see how that plays on network television whether people are all that interested in watching a character who is a lesbian full time maybe yes maybe no who knows whatever not a huge deal however it was a huge deal to the left why was it a huge deal to the left because they insisted on the left that you needed a lesbian to play a lesbian in the same way they need a transgender person to play a transgender person and a cat woman to play Catwoman like a woman who's a cat you need to play a natural cat woman you also need a lesbian to play a lesbian so CW trying to hone in on that decided you know what why don't we cast a ruby rose so Ruby Rose you'll remember maybe from the latest John wick movie I haven't seen her in a lot of stuff but she's a decent actress she can she plays solid really well i and she is bisexual so she is not a full-scale lesbian she calls herself gender fluid so she is male something she feels male some days and she feels female others and she's bisexual and she's pansexual and all this kind of stuff okay but here's the problem nobody on the right cares about this stuff right nobody on the right is like oh that's just terrible how did everyone on the Left win not she had to quit Twitter why did she quit Twitter because hilariously enough the left decided she was not lesbian enough she was bisexual not a full-scale lesbian and that meant she was just not enough of a lesbian for her to play the the sainted character of bat woman according to the Washington Post some corners of Twitter and Instagram are criticizing actors who have been cast to play gay characters on screen leading one of them to abandon a platform over the weekend an Australian actress Ruby Rose quit Twitter and shut down public commenting on her Instagram account after receiving backlash over her being cast as bat woman for Greg Berlanti series of arrowverse shows on CW by the way I believe Craig Berlanti is gay as well so it's not like the guy doesn't have an interest in LGBT issues part of the fear is centered on representation of DC Comics superhero who is a lesbian and the actress sweetie where on earth did Ruby is not a lesbian therefore she can't be bat woman come from has to be the funniest most ridiculous thing I've ever read I came out at 12 and have for the past five years had to deal with these she's too gay how do you all flip it like says I didn't change I wish we would all support each other and our journeys she says that she has identified as gender-fluid and she's I guess also on orange is the new black and you know Janelle Monae came out in her favor I guess Janelle Monae is also a lesbian or bisexual and I can't remember her sexuality because I frankly don't care at all but what I love is the fact that she is gender fluid so she's not gay enough also the character is Jewish but Roby Ruby roses in Jewish so I guess that she can't play a Jewish person I guess Sheldon Cooper can no longer play a straight person because the character the guy who plays Sheldon Cooper on Big Bang Theory is actually a gay guy right so he can't play a straight person I guess that Eric Stonestreet who plays cam on Modern Family and is actually a straight guy he can no longer play a gay guy nobody can play anything they're not actors have to be the actual parts every TV show has to be a reality show Superman actually has to be able to fly so it's gonna make casting really really difficult there are a lot of people who wanted to see Ashley Platts get the role I guess because she's a lesbian so I guess she's more lesbian so now we're having lesbian competitions I will say that I may put this in things that I like because I really am enjoying a I really am enjoying a lot the left eating its own it's pretty it's pretty spectacular watching the left think that it is not leftist enough so that that's pretty great okay another thing that I hate so Politico has an article from Stephen Miller's uncle because this is the thing that we're gonna do now we're gonna go find every relative who doesn't like you and have them write op-eds so Stephen Miller is of course the very anti-immigration both illegal and legal immigration guy in the Trump administration he was the top legislative aide to Jeff Sessions who sort of his top strategist and I remember being at a dinner with Ann Coulter and Stephen Miller and Jeff Sessions in which they discussed immigration for like three hours well everyone else is bored out of their skull so this has been Steven Miller's bag for a very long time well now his uncle is getting in on the act he writes a piece for Politico in which he talks about how Stephen Miller is just wrong about that he says let me tell you a story about Stephen Miller and chain migration it begins at the turn of the 20th century in a dirt floor Shack in the village of Antep all a shtetl of subsistence farmers and what is now Belarus beset by violent anti-jewish pogroms forced childhood conscription in the Czar's army the patriarch of the shack wolf liebe Gloucester fled a village where his forebears had lived for centuries and took his chances in America he set foot on Ellis Island on January 7th 1903 with 8 bucks to his name the fluent in Polish Russian and Yiddish he understood no English in elder son Nathan soon followed by street corner peddling and sweatshop toil Wolfe liebe and Nathan sent enough money home to pay off debts and by the immediate family's passage to America in 1906 and these would of course be the eventual great-grandparents of Stephenville great-great grandparents of Stephen Miller so is he glossaries his maternal grandfather Stephens mother Miriam is my sister I have watched with dismay and increasing horror is my nephew an educated man who is well aware of his heritage has become the architect of immigration policies that repudiate the very foundation of our families life in this country okay so here's the part about this I don't like you wanna make an immigration argument fine you want to suggest that our immigration policies are too restrictive on legal immigration I'm actually interested in hearing that argument cuz I think that they're a good arguments to be made on both sides of that particular issue if you want to make the case that relatives of politically popular figures are now authorities on what those politically popular figures should be saying I got a problem with that like are we gonna our family off-limits or his family not off-limits I mean this is a serious question because what we heard for years that Chelsea Clinton was off-limits until she wasn't off-limits and now she's off-limits again I guess because Hillary is no longer politically active when our relatives off-limits like when they decide to be off-limits or when they don't decide to be off-limits and beyond that I don't know why we care what Steven Miller's uncle has to say about things and why would that possibly matter I have lots of relatives I disagree with the vast majority of them on politics I'm a Jew that means most of my relatives are on the Left does that mean that my uncles and aunts have some sort of deeply valuable perspective on my heritage that I do not you know because I have parents who are part of that heritage as well I find all this incredibly stupid but the left has no rules when it comes to attacking folks on the right and so we're gonna dig up random relatives to go after people all of that is incredibly dumb okay we'll be back here at tomorrow and we will be broadcasting from Dallas so go check out our event if you are in Dallas I believe there are a few tickets left over to Live Nation or Ticketmaster and get a few of the remaining tickets if you're in
