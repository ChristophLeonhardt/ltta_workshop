CONTROVERSIAL COMMENTS AND
UNPREDICTABLE ON A NATIONAL
DEBATE STAGE.
SOUND FAMILIAR?
>> Martha: IT DOES.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU'RE NOT EXCLUSIVELY, DON DON
BLANKENSHIP.
A CANDIDATE FOR THE U.S. SENATE
OF FORMER MASSEY ENERGY SUN
DON'T LET COMPANY CEO.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU HERE
TONIGHT AGAIN.
GOOD NEWS, IF IT'S TRUE THAT YOU
MIGHT HAVE PICKED UP AS MUCH AS
EIGHT POINTS IN THE BALLS LAST
NIGHT AND WITH THEIR DATA, BUT
YOU HEAR WHAT IS COMING AT YOU
FROM THE WEEKLY STANDARD.
THEY SAY THAT YOU ARE ANOTHER
SHARON ANGLE.
ANOTHER ROY MOORE AND THAT YOU
PRESENT A DISASTER TO YOUR PARTY
AND THE GENERAL ELECTION IN
WEST VIRGINIA.
>> I THINK THEY ARE JUST WRONG.
THEY'VE BEEN WRONG A LOT.
THEY'VE BEEN WRONG SO FAR IN HIS
CAMPAIGN.
I'M A LITTLE BIT MIFFED THAT A
CHINA PERSON IS DISCRIMINATORY.
I THOUGHT THAT IF YOU REFER TO
SOMEONE AS AN ASIAN OR WHATEVER
YOU MIGHT TRY TO THROW IT IN
THAT CATEGORY BUT SOMEBODY FROM
CHINA IS FROM CHINA, SOMEBODY
FROM THE U.S. IS FROM THE U.S.,
BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT ANYBODY
THINKS THAT IS A RACIAL SLUR,
I'M SORRY, BUT I DON'T SEE IT.
>> Martha: UNDERSTOOD.
WHAT ABOUT COCAINE MITCH?
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD
SAY THAT'S A BIG REACH AND THAT
IT SUGGESTS SOMETHING THAT IS
SIMPLY NOT TRUE.
AND THAT IT IS SUCH A TANGENTIAL
ASSOCIATION WITH A SHIP THAT HAD
DRUGS ON THAT IS SOMEHOW RELATED
TO HIS WIFE'S FATHER.
YOU HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT --
YOU'VE BEEN SO MALIGNED FOR
THINGS YOU SAY YOU DIDN'T DO AND
THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND.
WHY WOULD YOU TAKE THAT TACT
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE?
>> MAYBE IT'S TO MAKE THE POINTS
THAT YOU JUST MADE.
THAT I'VE BEEN MALIGNED FOR
THINGS I --
>> Martha: SO AN EYE FOR AN
EYE I GUESS?
>> NO, IT'S MORE OR LESS THAT
THERE ARE THINGS THAT DON'T GO
THE WAY YOU WANT THEM TO GO.
HAVING COCAINE ON A FAMILY-OWNED
SHIP CERTAINLY SHOULD BE OF
INTEREST BECAUSE COCAINE DEATHS
IN THIS COUNTRY KEEP GOING UP
AND EVEN THOUGH THAT SHIP -- I
THINK HEADED TO EUROPE.
WE STILL NEED TO BE AWARE THAT
THERE ARE COCAINE AND OTHER
DRUGS MOVING ON THE HIGH SEAS ON
COMMERCIAL SHIPS AND IF NOTHING
ELSE SHOULD MAKE MAKE US AWARE
THAT WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL WHEN
THESE COMMERCIAL SHIPS ARE
DOCKING.
CERTAINLY THE FAMILY OF ELAINE
CHAO AND McCONNELL SHOULD BE
NO EXCEPTION TO THEM.
>> Martha: AS I SAID, PEOPLE
WOULD FIND THAT TO BE A BIT OF A
REACH TO CALL THEM COCAINE
MITCH, BUT YOU HAVE SAID THAT
AND THAT YOUR EXPLANATION FOR
IT.
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THIS,
BECAUSE IF YOU DO WIN IN THE
PRIMARY NEXT TUESDAY NIGHT,
DEMOCRATS ARE PRETTY MUCH
ALREADY PREPARING ADS.
YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN THE KIND OF
ADS THAT WILL BE LEVELED AGAINST
YOU.
ONE OF THEM WILL GO AFTER YOU ON
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES.
THEY WILL SAY THE METAL YOU USED
FOR MINING WEST VIRGINIA CAUSE
CANCER IN SOME PEOPLE AND YOU
DIVERTED THE WATER SOURCE TO
YOUR OWN HOME WHILE YOU LET THE
WATER IN THE REST OF HER
NEIGHBORHOOD THAT HAD A COAL
SLURRY AND IT BE CONTAMINATED.
THOSE WILL BE ASKED OF YOU.
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THOSE
CHARGES?
>> FIRST OF ALL, IT'S NOT EVEN
MY HOUSE.
THAT'S A GOOD PLACE TO START.
>> Martha: DID YOU PROVIDE
YOUR OWN WATER SOURCE IN YOUR
NEIGHBORHOOD FROM A DIFFERENT
WHILE?
>> NO.
IT'S A LONGER STORY THAN YOU
PROBABLY GOT TIME FOR, BUT THE
CITY, WHICH IS A SMALL TOWN
NEARBY HAD RUN WATER DOWN CLOSE
TO MY HOME ON THEIR OWN AND GAVE
ME A CHANCE TO PICK UP THAT
WATER.
BUT AT THAT POINT, NO ONE EVEN
KNEW THERE WAS THIS CONCERN
ABOUT ANY WELLS.
IT'S EASY TO MAKE UP STORIES AND
AS YOU SAID THEY ARE ALREADY
RUNNING THOSE ADS AND THEY ARE
PROBABLY GOING TO GET BEAT IN
THE PRIMARY AND JOE MANCHIN HAS
SO MUCH BAGGAGE THAT HE WILL BE
MUCH EASIER TO BEAT, SO I'M NOT
CONCERNED ABOUT BEING ABLE TO
BEAT JOE MANCHIN.
I'VE BECOME TWO OR THREE TIMES
BEFORE ON ISSUES AND THE MEDIA
ON THESE ISSUES WITH A WATER
SPELLER WITH AN ACCIDENT OR
WHATEVER ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT
THAN THE BEHAVIOR OF JOE
MANCHIN, WHICH IS INTENTIONAL.
>> Martha: SO IN TERMS OF THE
FACT THAT -- WE BROUGHT THIS UP
BACK IN    LAST NIGHT.
WITH REGARDS TO YOUR TIME IN
PRISON, YOUR PROBATION IS
SCHEDULED TO END THE DAY AFTER
THE PRIMARY, IS THAT CORRECT?
>> YES.
>> Martha: OKAY.
LAST NIGHT WAS INTERESTING THAT
NEITHER ONE OF YOUR OPPONENTS
REALLY WENT AFTER YOU ABOUT THAT
AT ALL, BUT HERE AGAIN IF YOU DO
WIN THE PRIMARY IT WILL BE FRONT
AND CENTER AND I KNOW THAT YOU
BELIEVE THAT YOU WERE FALSELY
IMPRISONED, BUT DO YOU THINK
THAT WILL BE A LIABILITY FOR YOU
IF YOU GET INTO A HEAD-TO-HEAD
MATCHUP WITH SENATOR MANCHIN?
>> FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T BELIEVE
THAT I WAS FALSELY IMPRISONED, I
KNOW THAT I WAS FALSELY
IMPRISONED.
THE REASON THEY DON'T ATTACK ME
AS THEY ARE BOTH ATTORNEYS AND
THEY KNOW WHAT AND 302S ARE AND
THEY KNOW FROM THE FILING THAT
WAS MADE THAT TEN OF THE 12 TO
302S THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
PROVIDED TO MY DEFENSE FROM THE
LEAD WITNESSES WERE NOT, AND
THEY KNOW THAT THERE WAS IN FACT
61, FOR YOUR LEGAL COMMUNITY OUT
THERE, 302S, DOZENS OF EMAILS
THAT HAD EXTREMELY EXCULPATORY
INFORMATION, SO THE CASE MORE
LIKELY, IF THERE'S ANY JUSTICE,
WILL BE INVALIDATED BEFORE THE
GENERAL ELECTION ANYWAY.
>> Martha: THANK YOU VERY MUCH
