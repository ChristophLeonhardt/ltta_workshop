in the aftermath of a leftist terrorist attempting to murder dozens of Republican Congress people there are widespread calls from both right and left to tamp down the level of violent language regularly utilized in political discourse it was a starry-eyed idea kind of dumb and was never likely to withstand a test of hard-nosed politics and naturally it didn't within two weeks the opponents of President Trump went right back to the violent language they were decrying on Thursday responding to the Senate health bill that would trim around the edges of Obamacare while restructuring Medicaid senator Elizabeth Warren took a political hot tomahawk to Republicans calling their bill blood money then the reactor Johnny Depp has been playing a fade pirate both on screen and off for the last decade who said that maybe an actor should assassinate Trump then there was Josh Fox a leftist film producer who followed up with this chim quote Mitch McConnell is a terrorist Donald Trump is a terrorist this bill terrorizes people and sentence his poor people to death here's leftist pressure organization Media Matters quote what pundits call a moderate Senate health care bill will kill people then there were these protesters quote GOP unveils health care bill while protesters bleed and scream the government wants to kill me and the risk aughts workin democratic consultant fact the GOP health care bill will kill Americans hashtag save ACA yes the violent language left thought was so terrible that it supposedly led to the Oklahoma City bombing and shooting of Gabby Giffords just had to stop but not the violent language that by the same theory may have impacted the Congressional shooter that has to continue after all how will people know how violence and threatening Republicans are a must Democrats describe them as murderers and terrorists I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show all righty so a lot to get to today we're going to talk about Johnny Depp and

slash venues the slash man that they know that we sent you okay so as the Republicans released their Senate health care bill which we'll go through in a second and talk about I don't like it I think it doesn't repeal Obamacare it does some good things because most Republican bills do some good things but if this is the big Obamacare repeal we were told about this is not that this is not what that is and it is a lie for Republicans who suggest that it is and they're a couple of serious Republican political problems associated with this health care bill but before we get to that I want to talk about the Democrats new obsession really isn't new I mean this has been since the election with killing Trump and saying violent things about Republicans and being just quite terrible so you know we talked in the aftermath the congressional shooting about when language is connected to violence and I said that I'm not going to explicitly blame language for violence unless the blank which explicitly calls for violence however I also said that when you have increased violent language when you have an increased tenor in political debate suggests that your political opposition terrorists who are benefiting from blood money that there is a small fringy group of people who are going to be set off by this and again I'm not going to draw a direct linkage but I think there is clearly an indirect language linkage language can affect random people for sure if you think of speech as a giant circle and then the the group of same people as mostly falling within this circle who understand what speeches and then there are outliers out here who can be set off as the circle of speech expands to include more violent speech then what you will see is that the circle starts to shrink actually and the number of reasonable people who understand this is meant not to be violent shrinks and you start to exclude some of the people on the fringes who start to become irrational and crazy anyway the Democrats have obviously been engaging in this sort of stuff for a while Johnny Depp was making headlines last night because he was speaking net first of all actors should never speak outside of their Hollywood roles there's a reason people write lines for them it's because actors are generally not the most intelligent people on earth I know a lot of actors there's a reason there are stereotypes about actors they memorize one particularly movie actors who memorize three lines at a time I mean not even stage actors have to memorize an entire play but movie actors memorize three lines at a time no one thinks that Johnny Depp is some sort of genius also I don't know why Johnny Depp's look is now a homeless man who killed three other homeless people and then assembled their wardrobe it probably cost him thousands of dollars Greg Gutfeld says he looks like a refugee from Hot Topic I think that's probably correct it looks like he raided my grandmother's drawer for that for that blue bracelet and then he found a teenage girl and robbed her car for some of those other bracelets and then it looks like he went over to the local jewelry store and knocked the debt and knocked it over for those blingy rings or alternatively he went to a candy shop and just spent a lot of money there and then he grabbed a hat that may have come from a bad guy in western or also may have come from a hipster I'm going to go with probably from the hipster and he got a Michael Jackson silk black shirt in order to from from the dead man's closet in any case here was Johnny Depp who has been playing a Fae pirate really since the first Pirates of the Caribbean it's sad because Johnny Depp used to be a pretty good actor and now Johnny Depp just does the Lone Ranger as a favorite and then he does the same Tyra isn't a pirate and then he does Black Mass he tries not to be a fave high rep ADIZ order fails and even the faaaa pirate sort of infuses his his attempts to be a Boston gangster anyway here's Bay pirate Johnny Depp talking about how he would like to kill President Trump given rehabilitation I think he needs is going to be in the personal beholder I'd like I like that roll of parliament woman's the last time an actor assassinated the president when I was sailing hi Jennifer I'm not an actor I live through living my life for a living you know I'm just like I'm a Miranda pirate you can hit maybe let me just tell you I mean I'm I've been playing this semi gay pirate for years and I've made a jillion dollars off of it and blow nearly all of it on stupidity but you know I have some things to say about politics I mean for god sake we're gonna play a pirate play a pirate higher anyway so the Democrats have have little beyond this sort of violent language there they're beginning to realize that and so all hell is breaking loose in the Democratic Party Bernie Sanders is going out there and he's openly proclaiming our brand sucks because he would like to be the brand yes he wants the brand of the Democratic Party to be a crazy old loon bag from Vermont who used to vacation in the USSR and is a socialist but it is not my fault that I love putting so much I had to buy a second vacation home just to store all of my pudding as well as Ben and Jerry's ice cream which is quite delicious although it hurts my dentures because it is very cold so I like to wait until it melts into a soupy concoction which I could then eat but slowly to a straw while looking out at the lake in my vacation home Bernie Sanders go Democratic congressman Tim Ryan told the New York Times just the other day that quote our brand is worse than Trump is he right I mean it is the Democratic brand he may be really Democrat look I speak as longer serving independent in American congressional history the Democratic brand is pretty bad i mean i don't i think the Trump bad brand is also pretty bad as is the Republican brand that's why so many people are giving up on politics they're looking in Washington and what the average American is saying I'm in a lot of pain my kid can't afford to go to college I'm making 10 bucks an hour what are you going to do for me and they don't hear much coming out of Washington okay so he's right that the Democrats have a terrible brand I think that his his recommendation that the brand move further the left is kind of insane democratic representative Tim Ryan he came out and he said that Nancy Pelosi who is now under fire after the loss in GA six listen Pelosi's brand is awful and the is true okay if you look at the ga6 races I mentioned yesterday and the day before if you look at the Georgia sixth race the name that was national those mentioned the most in that race was not Trump it was Nancy Pelosi and here's Tim Ryan pointing that out well what I really think is that leader Pelosi looking forward to the 2018 election has to ask yourself this question do I help Democrats win swing districts which we need to win in 2018 or do I not and have an honest dialogue with herself and I just I think the answer is obvious in the interactive easy to go III I think that if we are going to win this we're going to regain the majority in 2018 we have to have new leadership okay so even the Democrats are starting to realize they have a problem here meanwhile Nancy Pelosi is gripping with that death grip of her gnarled fingers on to power in the house here is Nancy Pelosi dentures a-movin talking about how she is the greatest petition who ever lived ever in the history of the United States and I don't understand why people are so angry at me all the time it's just terrible a master legislator I am mega litigious politically astute leader I am my leadership is recognized by many of them the country and that is why I'm able to attract the support that I do which is essential to our election sad to say I'm well liked in beautiful and everyone loves me good luck Nancy Pelosi with all of us so here's the thing as I said yesterday the Republicans have the upper hand because the Democrats are in disarray what can bring the Democrats together is not just an unpopular president like President Trump and we'll talk about what he's been doing over the last 24 hours but also they need a piece of legislation to rally around so that they can get their base out and so that they can get people on the edge to vote well we view Republicans home what they need is a piece of legislation that is so polarizing that they can that they can grab on to it and hold on to it and use it as a club to be a Republican this is what happened in 2010 after Barack Obama pushed forward the auto bailouts and he pushed forward made what was essentially the Nationals in the auto industry and stimulus package and pushed forward Obamacare and then in 2010 Republicans wiped out Democrats okay in 1994 it was Bill Clinton's Hillary care proposal that led Republicans to wipe out Democrats so what is the big proposal from Republicans naturally they decide to play right into Democrats hands so they could have started with tax reform they could have they could have attempted to get 60 votes on tax reform they could have started with even an infrastructure bill that wouldn't have been so polarizing I'm talking politically now not even from a conservative point of view just politically if you want to win the last thing you start with is touching the health care system because the health care system is already collapsing one of two things going to happen either you're going to do a full overthrow of the health care system that actually fixes it but it's unpopular because there's a transition period for any health care system or you are going to leave it in place and let it die and or there there's a third possibility which is the worst of both which is you make some changes around the edges that may be beneficial in some ways but you own the continued failure and that's of course what Republicans are choosing because they are stupid so here is what is in the Republican Senate Obamacare light bill so there are a couple of things in here that are good there are tax cuts ready date cuts taxes it gets rid of the employer mandate and it also and it also restructures Medicaid so Medicaid right now is basically an open-ended program where the federal government is absorbing the increase in the number of people who are rushing onto Medicaid and then giving grants out on a need-based basis as opposed to a per capita flat rate basis to the states okay that is a recipe for unending debt as far as getting rid of the taxes and getting rid of the individual mandate and getting rid of the employer mandate and all this the problem is that if you keep the central Obamacare regulations in place what you're really doing by getting rid of all of this is blowing up spending because if you don't have taxes to cover the cost of Obamacare if you do not have mandates to force healthy people into the Obama care system or into the the individual health insurance market then there is no one to pay for the sick people who Obamacare forces insurance companies to cover that is the problem you are exacerbating the death spiral that Republicans talk about Republicans talk about the Obamacare death spiral there's not enough money to pay for this insurers are dropping out so they can't make money off of it so what do we do well Republicans just made that actually worse with this Senate bill because the bill retains Obamacare's core regulatory scheme and as I said yesterday the bill is not designed to actually get rid of Obamacare it's not designed to lower taxes it is designed to lower the debt number so that they can get a tax cut through which is basically the again to the tax point it is designed to restructure Medicaid which is a good thing a very good thing avec roi is head over heels for the bill because it restructures Medicaid which is a good thing and then it is designed to let Republicans say that repealed Obamacare which is actually a really bad thing because you don't want to live the American people about repealing Obama care when he didn't repeal it because you're going to take ownership of a non free-market system in the name of the free-market which is always a disaster for Republicans so first of all six things about this bill first insurance companies will still be mandated to cover pre-existing conditions the minute you force insurance companies to do this they begin hemorrhaging cash because people will wait until they get sick to get insurance the bill gets rid of the individual mandate okay so it doesn't force people into the system which means that these insurance companies will start to go bankrupt or they will start to raise their rates dramatically which of course does not decrease the price of premiums it increases the price of premiums the Republican bill leans heavily on subsidies and does away with the mandates and taxes and that basically destroys the Obamacare individual market general horowitz of conservative review has this exactly right he says the bill merely loosens existing waiver authority up to the discretion of HHS for a few regulations a provision that will not be strong enough to signal flexibility to insurers enough to reduce premiums so the idea here would be that if you got rid of a lot of the regulations that insurers would compete to reduce premiums the bill doesn't do enough to do that the bill REE enshrines a bunch of subsidies to insurance companies as I talked about from Peter Sudirman or Reason magazine yesterday the Republicans originally opposed the idea that the federal government was going to subsidize insurance companies now they're saying that it's great that the federal government is subsidizing insurance companies and that is not great okay begin the reason they're subsidizing the insurance companies is because they kept all of the Obamacare regulations the bill also provides new entitlements for middle-income Americans so right now Obamacare gives subsidies for insurance purchase the families of four making four times the federal poverty level it's about a hundred thousand dollars the Senate Republican bill reduces that to eighty six thousand dollars but as prices rise which they will continue to do given the continuation of the regulations the subsidies are not going to be enough now this is still better than the system that was in place from the house so far as covering people and not forcing them onto Medicare but it is a giant subsidy system it is an entitlement it alters Medicaid and this is a good thing but it doesn't mostly down the road so originally the House bill that was proposed would have begun rolling back federal funding on a need-based basis from beginning in 2020 and ending the open-ended funding of expansion of Medicaid enrollees now the rollback has been kicked back to 2021 you know why it's because it's after Trump's re-election and in 2025 it creates a growth cap on Medicaid payments linked to inflation rather than health cost inflation which means that basically instead of the federal government's Medicaid reimbursement being linked to the cost of health care it's linked just to the dollar well the problem with that of course is that that means that Medicaid reimbursements are going to drop which is okay because that forces people under private insurance which they should be getting anyway but it is never going to materialize anyway because it's 2025 if you really think that it's now 2016 2017 if you really think that eight years from now anything is going to be certain then you don't know how government works the bill does defund Planned Parenthood this is stopped to the conservatives it does it for one year okay Medicaid is not able to fund Planned Parenthood for one year not for four years not for ten years for one year and finally as I say the individual mandate in taxes disappear which would be good except for it exacerbating the Obamacare death spiral for which Republicans will now be blamed so I think Nate silver basically has this right I'm just being intellectually honest here this bill is not a health care revision it is it is about restructuring Medicaid which is good but it does so in the long term when it's not actually gonna materialize and it is about tax cuts and ensuring that Republicans can get tax reform through well what this means that there's been some blowback from some of the Republicans in the Senate I would not expect that senator Cruz and Senator Lee maybe are going to stand against this I think that they may be posing an opening bargaining position you know I would hope that they would stand against the bill that doesn't repeal Obamacare after Ted Cruz shut down the government in order to propose the repeal of Obamacare I don't see why things have changed here senator Cruz talking about you can hear that there's a little bit of wiggle room here senator Cruz I think would would be interested in probably finding some sort of solution that allows him to save face we've been working collaboratively that entire time trying to solve the problems the underlying problems in healthcare this current draft doesn't get the job done but I believe we can get to yes I believe we can get this done there is an agreement to be reached and I have been for the last five months working around the clock to get to that agreement and I still believe we can get there key to getting an agreement to getting a bill that can pass is we need common-sense reforms in the bill that lower the cost of premiums the single biggest reason that so many people are unhappy with Obamacare that are hurting under Obamacare is because it's caused premiums to skyrocket when I'm home in Texas I hear over and over again from Texans who say I can't afford health insurance because of Obamacare we've got to fix that the current draft circulated this morning doesn't do nearly enough the problem is did not - lowers about actually lower premiums we can stop it there the only reason that we're going to be able to lower cost of premiums is by getting rid of the court Obamacare regulations on pre-existing conditions the bill isn't going to do that we're going to get to the rest of the Republican reaction why Democrats are chortling over the secretly but first I want to say thank you to our friends over at the u.s.

now okay so you know Ted Cruz sounds like he wants to vote for the thing this I think this is going to pass I think it will play out like this it'll play out it's definite like the House bill the House bill was presented and they said we're going to rush this Russia Prussia Russia and then it failed and then they came back and they made some very minor tweaks and there's a lot of public pressure because like oh I guess we've held out long enough and then they passed basically the same bill as House bill number one with a few minor tweaks attached that didn't mean anything in that some of which have been stripped out by the Senate I think the same thing will probably happen here but Rand Paul's assessment that this is exactly correct he says this is still Obamacare it could still happen if the people who wrote the bill are willing to negotiate conservatives won a repeal bill I want to build it looks like feels like and is a repeal bill my fear is when I look at this I keep reading it and it's like it sounds like Obamacare to me doesn't even sound like Obamacare life in some areas it may be Obamacare Plus on the subsidy side we can't have a bill that spends more than Obamacare in the first couple years and call that a repeal bill so yes we should be reformed repeal but we also have to have sufficient confidence in capitalism competition and free markets okay so what's hilarious about all of this is that as the Republicans rightly the conservatives in the caucus rightly say this does not repeal Obamacare the Democrats of course it wouldn't matter what this did if it just said we want the American health care the american Care Act or the Affordable Care Act Obamacare we just want Obamacare to be called Obamacare we're gonna get rid of one letter the Democrats the end of the world we're all going to die it's the worst thing that ever happened we if you're going to get accused of that anyway you may as well make the changes you want to make you may as well make the changes that are actually going to ensure the premiums come down because no matter what you do Democrats are going to claim that at the end of the world you're going to kill people Elizabeth Warren is going to go out there and say it's blood money here's Elizabeth Warren today saying it's blood money she grabbed her tomahawk and she was chancing around the fire here's what she had to say this is a really terrible bill and make no mistake this bill is about tax breaks for the rich and this bill is about Republicans saying hey those are our priorities we're taking care of the people we care about and everyone else can just bear the cost of it this is the moment to tell the Republicans in the United States Senate to tell every one of the Republicans in the United States Senate no this bill does not represent our values this bill is not who we are as a country we believe that health care is a basic human right and we will get out there and fight for it and then she tweeted out I've read the Republican health care bill this is blood money they're paying for tax cuts with American lives blood money okay first of all this lady takes much muchos money from Planned Parenthood that's actual blood money but she talked about it's blood money and we're going to die everyone's going to die it's the worst thing ever this thing trims around the edges it really does and it increases subsidies in some areas it gets rid of the individual mandate the idea by the way that's Larry is that they're making cuts and they're going to make you pay for it who's you okay I've been paying for Obamacare since it was in since its inception for my tax dollars I'm paying for Obamacare through increased premiums in it so view so this idea that me that we're going to change the system and it's going to redistribute the cost one of the great Democrat talking points here is they keep saying well this is a tax cut for the rich excuse me excuse me or it's a redistribution of money from poor to rich Obamacare was the greatest redistributed move in modern history moving wealth from the middle class to the poor from moving wealth from the the young to the old moving it from the healthy to the sick that's what Obamacare was and going back to status quo ante is not actually the destruction of some sort of grand system here but this is what Democrats are talking like we're Chuck Schumer says the same thing he says this would end health care as we know everyone's gonna die ah even as we continue to get more details the broad outlines are clear this is a bill designed to strip away health care benefits and protections from Americans who need it most in order to give a tax break to the folks who need at least this is a bill that would end Medicaid as we know it rolling back Medicaid expansion cutting federal support for the program even more than the House bill which cut Medicaid by eight hundred billion dollars from what is reported in just three short years under the Senate bill Republicans will kick millions off their Medicaid coverage ok so again the Democrats are always going to claim this stuff Barack Obama went on on Facebook and posted a long rant about how terrible the bill is and how everyone's going to die and the Democrats are always gonna claim this they're always going to claim this and this is why Republicans ought to just do whatever the hell they want and pass a bill that does what they said it would do and repeal this piece of crap legislation instead of trimming around the edges because they actually want to keep it while lying to you about it that's what's really nasty about all of us ok well as we continue here on the bench Shapiro show I want to get to the mailbag we're going to do the mailbag we're also going to get to president Trump's comments about the tapes finally we have the answer on the tapes and all of that we will talk about that I also want to talk about the fact that the Obama administration really did
