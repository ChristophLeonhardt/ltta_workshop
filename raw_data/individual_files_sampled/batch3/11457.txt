levena Putin has urged Russia's security services to create a safe barrier against foreign interference in the country society and politics his comments come ahead of next year's presidential election Marty city pet rancor has the details Vladimir Putin in his speech was talking to those who work in Intelligence and Security this Wednesday is a professional holiday for these people in Russia in fact the Russian security service is marking exactly one century of its existence so on this special occasion mr. Putin did something he doesn't often do the president directly accused foreign intelligence of interfering or meddling in Russia's own affairs not that I've rarely heard words interference or meddling from others but back to mr. Putin but surely there is a great responsibility on the intelligence services to put up a safe barrier against external meddling in our social and political life and to counteract the work of foreign security agencies which and it's no secret are doing all they can to ramp up their activities in Russia it's no secret that throughout the last couple of years whenever and wherever there was an election or a major referendum eventually you'd hear some sort of news about investigations into alleged Russian meddling or interfere in some sort of way of trying to pull the strengths but in this case Vladimir Putin is talking about possible similar attempts aimed at Russia where the presidential campaign just kicked off a couple of days ago
