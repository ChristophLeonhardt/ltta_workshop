WE REACHED OUT TO THE DOJ.

89
00:03:04,591 --> 00:03:06,025
THEY DECLINED TO COMMENT.

90
00:03:06,025 --> 00:03:08,194
THE FIX WAS IN FOR HILLARY

91
00:03:08,194 --> 00:03:09,662

THEY DON'T DO THEIR WORK AND

159
00:05:58,331 --> 00:06:02,969
THEY TRY TO OUT-RAGE EACH OTHER.

160
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:07,073
PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF THE

161
00:06:07,073 --> 00:06:10,076

INVOLVED SHOOTINGS?

172
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:35,201
>> THE PRESIDENT MADE HIS

00:06:35,201 --> 00:06:37,203
POSITION CRYSTAL CLEAR.

174
00:06:37,203 --> 00:06:40,073
I LET YOU RUDELY INTERRUPT ME

THE PRESIDENT MADE HIS POSITION

182
00:06:51,784 --> 00:06:55,555
CRYSTAL CLEAR ON THIS TOPIC.

183
00:06:55,555 --> 00:06:57,023
HE FEELS STRONGLY THAT STANDING

184
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,890
FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM IS

185
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,826
SOMETHING WE SHOULD DO.

186
00:06:59,826 --> 00:07:02,295
THE PRESIDENT WON'T BACK DOWN

187
00:07:02,295 --> 00:07:03,396

192
00:07:10,036 --> 00:07:11,170
>> WILL THE PRESIDENT DEAL WITH

193
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,973
THE ISSUE OF POLICE INVOLVED

194
00:07:13,973 --> 00:07:14,340
SHOOTING?

195
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,809
>> I WILL DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF

196
00:07:16,809 --> 00:07:17,877
ADDRESSING YOUR COLLEAGUES

197
00:07:17,877 --> 00:07:18,244
QUESTION.

198
00:07:18,244 --> 00:07:19,579
>> Sean: MAYBE YOU THE AMERICAN

199
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:21,748
PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF THE MEDIA

200
00:07:21,748 --> 00:07:25,218
NASTY PERSONAL ATTACKS INCLUDING

201
00:07:25,218 --> 00:07:26,786
COVERAGE OF OUR FIRST LADY

202
00:07:26,786 --> 00:07:28,388
MELANIA TRUMP.

203
00:07:28,388 --> 00:07:30,256
FOLLOWING A MEDICAL PROCEDURE

204
00:07:30,256 --> 00:07:31,924
FOR A KIDNEY CONDITION.

205
00:07:31,924 --> 00:07:35,094
SHE WAS ONLY SEEN ONCE IN THE

206
00:07:35,094 --> 00:07:36,496
PUBLIC SPOTLIGHT.

207
00:07:36,496 --> 00:07:38,564
LEAVING SOME IN THE PRESSRUNING

208
00:07:38,564 --> 00:07:43,136
WILD WITH INSANE SPECULATION

209
00:07:43,136 --> 00:07:46,339
WITH SOME OF THE NASTIEST

210
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:49,442
CONSPIRACY THEORIES.

211
00:07:49,442 --> 00:07:55,648
THIS WRITER TWEETED THAT I WISH

212
00:07:55,648 --> 00:07:57,950
I DIDN'T SUSPECT IT WAS ABOUT

213
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,752
CONCEALING ABUSE.

214
00:07:59,752 --> 00:08:04,824
I WISH THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT:

215
00:08:04,824 --> 00:08:06,826
THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS AND

216
00:08:06,826 --> 00:08:07,226
DISGUSTING.

217
00:08:07,226 --> 00:08:09,762
THAT'S NOT ALL.

218
00:08:09,762 --> 00:08:14,100
LOOK AT DAVID, A NEVER-TRUMP

219
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:20,239
TWEETING:

220
00:08:20,373 --> 00:08:22,675
THE PRESIDENT HAS ARTICLE 2

221
00:08:22,675 --> 00:08:24,010
AUTHORITY OVER THE SECRET

222
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,445
SERVICE.

223
00:08:25,445 --> 00:08:28,581
IS THAT OBSTRUCTION?

224
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:31,717
THIS CONTINUED EACH ON

225
00:08:31,717 --> 00:08:32,118
TELEVISION.

226
00:08:32,118 --> 00:08:34,287
THIS IS HOW INSANE OUR MEDIA HAS

227
00:08:34,287 --> 00:08:34,620
BECOME.

228
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,289
THIS IS A MASS PSYCHOSIS THAT

229
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:40,326
KICKED IN ABOUT 10 P.M. NOVEMBER

230
00:08:40,326 --> 00:08:43,996
8th, 2016, WHEN THE PERSON THEY

231
00:08:43,996 --> 00:08:45,665
THOUGHT WOULD NEVER WIN WON BY A

232
00:08:45,665 --> 00:08:46,332
BIG MARGIN.

233
00:08:46,332 --> 00:08:49,502
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WONDERING

234
00:08:49,502 --> 00:08:51,337
WHERE THE FIRST LADY IS THESE

235
00:08:51,337 --> 00:08:51,637
DAYS.

236
00:08:51,637 --> 00:08:53,272
DROPPED OUT OF SIGHT SEVERAL

237
00:08:53,272 --> 00:08:54,740
WEEKS AGO.

238
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,176
WE HAVE NOT SEEN HER SINCE THE

239
00:08:57,176 --> 00:08:58,077
10th.

240
00:08:58,077 --> 00:09:00,613
AND EVERYONE HAS THEIR QUESTIONS

241
00:09:00,613 --> 00:09:02,715
ABOUT WHERE IS SHE?

242
00:09:02,715 --> 00:09:05,451
>> THE LAST TIME WAS ON MAY

243
00:09:05,451 --> 00:09:05,985
10th.

244
00:09:05,985 --> 00:09:06,686
24 DAYS.

245
00:09:06,686 --> 00:09:07,587
MORE THAN 3 WEEKS.

246
00:09:07,587 --> 00:09:10,089
A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HER

247
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:11,591
SURGERY.

248
00:09:11,591 --> 00:09:15,161
HER TIME AT WALTER REED.

249
00:09:15,161 --> 00:09:16,696
HOW LONG DOES SHE HAVE TO BE OUT

250
00:09:16,696 --> 00:09:19,699
OF SIGHT TO MAKE THIS A

251
00:09:19,699 --> 00:09:21,267
LEGITIMATE MEDIA STORY?

252
00:09:21,267 --> 00:09:23,836
>> FIRST LADIES GET MEDIA

253
00:09:23,836 --> 00:09:24,203
COVERAGE.

254
00:09:24,203 --> 00:09:27,640
WHEN A FIRST LADY DISAPPEARS

255
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,674
FROM THE PUBLIC SCENE 24 DAYS

256
00:09:28,674 --> 00:09:31,511
AFTER BEING IN THE HOSPITAL, OF

257
00:09:31,511 --> 00:09:36,349
COURSE REPORTERS ARE RAISING

258
00:09:36,349 --> 00:09:36,716
QUESTIONS.

259
00:09:36,716 --> 00:09:37,783
>> THE FIRST LADY HAS BEEN SEEN

260
00:09:37,783 --> 00:09:39,685
IN PUBLIC FOR 25 DAYS.

261
00:09:39,685 --> 00:09:41,487
I AM NOT SURPRISED.

262
00:09:41,487 --> 00:09:46,259
IT TOOK THAT SHAW SHANK GUY

263
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:48,394
YEARS TO TUNNEL OUT.

264
00:09:48,394 --> 00:09:56,168
>> Sean: THIS IS SO DESPICABLE.

265
00:09:56,168 --> 00:09:58,638
4 LAST WEEK SAW MELANIA TRUMP

266
00:09:58,638 --> 00:09:59,338
AND SAID NOTHING.

267
00:09:59,338 --> 00:10:01,641
I HAVE SOURCES CONFIRMING.

268
00:10:01,641 --> 00:10:03,142
SHE HAD AN OPERATION.

269
00:10:03,142 --> 00:10:06,078
MAYBE WISHING HER WELL IS THE

270
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:08,180
APPROPRIATE RESPONSE.

271
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,249
THE FIRST LADY RESPONDED ON

272
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:18,891
TWITTER, WRITING:

273
00:10:19,025 --> 00:10:22,295
WOULD THAT SHUT THEM OUT?

274
00:10:22,295 --> 00:10:23,329
PROBABLY NOT.

275
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:28,034
ANOTHER ANTI-TRUMP NONSTORY.

276
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:29,135
ABOUT THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES

277
00:10:29,135 --> 00:10:32,138
BEING DISINVITED TO THE WHITE

278
00:10:32,138 --> 00:10:35,775
HOUSE AFTER THE BIG SUPER BOWL

279
00:10:35,775 --> 00:10:37,677
VICTORY.

280
00:10:37,677 --> 00:10:38,678
SARAH SANDERS RESPONDED.

281
00:10:38,678 --> 00:10:41,514
>> 80 MEMBERS OF THE EAGLES

282
00:10:41,514 --> 00:10:43,950
COMMITED TO ATTEND THIS EVENT AS

283
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,852
RECENTLY AS FRIDAY AS WELL AS

284
00:10:46,852 --> 00:10:51,090
OVER 1,000 FANS FROM THE EAGLES

285
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:51,524
ORGANIZATION.

286
00:10:51,524 --> 00:10:53,993
THE EAGLES ARE THE ONES THAT

287
00:10:53,993 --> 00:10:55,261
TRIED TO CHANGE THEIR COMMITMENT

288
00:10:55,261 --> 00:10:56,929
AT THE 11th HOUR.

289
00:10:56,929 --> 00:10:58,764
THE PRESIDENT THINKS THE FANS

290
00:10:58,764 --> 00:11:00,600
DESERVE BETTER THAN THAT.

291
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,369
THIS WAS NOT A POLITICAL STUNT

292
00:11:03,369 --> 00:11:05,271
BY THE EAGLES FRANCHISE.

293
00:11:05,271 --> 00:11:06,472
THEN THEY WOULD HAVE PLANED TO

294
00:11:06,472 --> 00:11:09,375
ATTEND AND BACKED OUT AT THE

295
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,943
LAST-MINUTE AND WOULD NOT HAVE

296
00:11:10,943 --> 00:11:13,012
ATTEMPTED TO RE-SCHEDULE THE

297
00:11:13,012 --> 00:11:14,914
VISIT WHEN THEY KNEW THE

298
00:11:14,914 --> 00:11:16,549
PRESIDENT WAS GOING TO BE

299
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:16,916
OVERSEAS.

300
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:21,887
THEY WOULD NOT HAVE WAITED UNTIL

301
00:11:21,887 --> 00:11:25,524
MONDAY AFTER OVER 1,000 OF THEIR

302
00:11:25,524 --> 00:11:27,793
FANS TOOK TIME OFF OF THEIR

303
00:11:27,793 --> 00:11:29,028
SCHEDULE TO ATTEND THE EVENT.

304
00:11:29,028 --> 00:11:30,329
>> Sean: THE PRESIDENT WAS RIGHT

305
00:11:30,329 --> 00:11:31,897
TO CANCEL THIS EVENT.

306
00:11:31,897 --> 00:11:34,467
BY THE WAY, LOOK AT THE NFL

307
00:11:34,467 --> 00:11:35,167
TODAY.

308
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:43,709
LOOK AT THE NEW RULE REQUIRING

309
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:45,678
PLAYERS TO STAND OR GO HIDE IN

310
00:11:45,678 --> 00:11:46,979
THE LOCKER ROOM.

311
00:11:46,979 --> 00:11:48,447
THE OWNER OF THE NEW YORK JET

312
00:11:48,447 --> 00:11:50,049
OFFERED TO PAY THE FINES FOR ANY

313
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:53,085
PLAYER THAT PROTESTS THE ANTHEM.

314
00:11:53,085 --> 00:11:55,354
I HAVE HAD IT.

315
00:11:55,354 --> 00:11:57,223
I AM SUPPOSED TO TUNE INTO A

316
00:11:57,223 --> 00:11:59,091
FOOTBALL GAME AND WATCH PEOPLE

317
00:11:59,091 --> 00:12:01,727
WHO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY MAKING A

318
00:12:01,727 --> 00:12:02,161
STATEMENT.

319
00:12:02,161 --> 00:12:05,431
NOT THE EAGLES IN THIS CASE.

320
00:12:05,431 --> 00:12:10,936
BUT THEY MADE A POLITICAL

321
00:12:10,936 --> 00:12:12,872
STATEMENT REGARDING THE WHITE

322
00:12:12,872 --> 00:12:13,172
HOUSE.

323
00:12:13,172 --> 00:12:14,907
THE FLAG IS HONORING MEN AND

324
00:12:14,907 --> 00:12:17,943
WOMEN WHO DIED FOR THEIR COUNT

325
00:12:17,943 --> 00:12:18,277
REACH.

326
00:12:18,277 --> 00:12:21,080
LOOK WHAT ROGER GOODELL AND

327
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:27,787
OTHER NFL OWNERS HAVE DONE.

328
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,923
I AM DONE WITH THE NFL.

329
00:12:30,923 --> 00:12:32,024
I LIKE COLLEGE FOOTBALL.

330
00:12:32,024 --> 00:12:34,493
UNLESS MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL

331
00:12:34,493 --> 00:12:35,327
FOOTBALL LEAGUE GAIN THE RESPECT

332
00:12:35,327 --> 00:12:38,664
FOR THE FLAG AND THOSE WHO BLED

333
00:12:38,664 --> 00:12:44,870
AND DIED FIGHTING UNDER THAT

334
00:12:45,004 --> 00:12:46,739
TODAY THE PRESIDENT HOSTED A

335
00:12:46,739 --> 00:12:49,408
CELEBRATION FEATURING THE MARINE

336
00:12:49,408 --> 00:12:51,243
BAND AND AMERICANS HAVE SO MUCH

337
00:12:51,243 --> 00:12:53,179
TO CELEBRATE INCLUDING THE

338
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:55,915
BOOMING ECONOMY.

339
00:12:55,915 --> 00:12:56,248
WOW!

340
00:12:56,248 --> 00:12:59,785
SO DIFFERENT THAN JUST 501 DAYS

341
00:12:59,785 --> 00:13:00,052
AGO.

342
00:13:00,052 --> 00:13:00,619
TAKE A LOOK.

343
00:13:00,619 --> 00:13:03,155
>> OUR COUNTRY HAS NEVER DONE

344
00:13:03,155 --> 00:13:04,323
BETTER THAN IT'S DOING RIGHT

345
00:13:04,323 --> 00:13:06,692
NOW.

346
00:13:06,692 --> 00:13:07,093
NEVER!

347
00:13:07,093 --> 00:13:09,462
RECORD NUMBERS IN EVERY OUTPOST.

348
00:13:09,462 --> 00:13:13,432
YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON.

349
00:13:13,432 --> 00:13:15,234
LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS WE

350
00:13:15,234 --> 00:13:17,136
HAVE HAD.

351
00:13:17,136 --> 00:13:18,270
LOWEST AFRICAN-AMERICAN

352
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,438
UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE HISTORY OF

353
00:13:19,438 --> 00:13:22,274
OUR COUNTRY.

354
00:13:22,274 --> 00:13:23,576
LOWEST HISPANIC NUMBERS IN THE

355
00:13:23,576 --> 00:13:28,347
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.

356
00:13:28,347 --> 00:13:33,352
LOWEST NUMBERS FOR WOMEN IN 21

357
00:13:33,352 --> 00:13:33,652
YEARS.

358
00:13:33,652 --> 00:13:36,622
WE HAVE CREATED 7 TRILLION

359
00:13:36,622 --> 00:13:40,559
DOLLARS OF VALUE IN OUR COUNTRY

360
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:41,427
SINCE THE ELECTION.

361
00:13:41,427 --> 00:13:44,196
WE ARE THE LARGEST ECONOMY IN

362
00:13:44,196 --> 00:13:45,931
THE WORLD AND GETTING A LOT

363
00:13:45,931 --> 00:13:46,999
LARGER AND FAST.

364
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:49,268
IT'S HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY.

365
00:13:49,268 --> 00:13:52,505
ACTUALLY, QUICKER THAN I EVEN

366
00:13:52,505 --> 00:13:52,838
THOUGHT.

367
00:13:52,838 --> 00:13:57,943
>> Sean: ONLY FIRST1 DAYS.

368
00:13:57,943 --> 00:13:59,445
-- ONLY 501 DAYS.

369
00:13:59,445 --> 00:14:02,214
BAD NEWS FOR THE CORRUPT MEDIA

370
00:14:02,214 --> 00:14:03,215
BECAUSE THEY WANT THE PRESIDENT

371
00:14:03,215 --> 00:14:04,350
TO FAIL.

372
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,718
THEY WANT TO DESTROY TRUMP AT

373
00:14:05,718 --> 00:14:06,385
ANY COST.

374
00:14:06,385 --> 00:14:08,187
HIM BEING SUCCESSFUL IS NOT GOOD

375
00:14:08,187 --> 00:14:09,355
TOWARDS THAT GOAL.

376
00:14:09,355 --> 00:14:12,558
THEIR LITTLE EGOS CAN REMAIN

377
00:14:12,558 --> 00:14:13,759
INTACT AND THEIR FRIENDS IN THE

378
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,861
DEMOCRATIC PARTY ARE HOPING TO

379
00:14:15,861 --> 00:14:16,862
REGAIN POWER.

380
00:14:16,862 --> 00:14:17,596
THAT'S WHY THIS MID-TERM

381
00:14:17,596 --> 00:14:18,597
ELECTION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT

382
00:14:18,597 --> 00:14:19,732
IN OUR LIFETIME.

383
00:14:19,732 --> 00:14:22,067
THAT WON'T STOP THE PRESIDENT'S

384
00:14:22,067 --> 00:14:23,702
ECONOMIC POLICIES FROM VASTLY

385
00:14:23,702 --> 00:14:25,805
IMPROVING THIS COUNTRY.

386
00:14:25,805 --> 00:14:29,809
REMEMBER THE FORGOTTEN MEN AND

387
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:30,676
WOMEN.

388
00:14:30,676 --> 00:14:34,246
NOW THE ATLANTA FED IS

389
00:14:34,246 --> 00:14:35,614
PREDICTING THE ECONOMY WILL GROW

390
00:14:35,614 --> 00:14:37,483
AT 4.8%.

391
00:14:37,483 --> 00:14:40,219
COMPARE THIS TO THE 8 YEARS OF

392
00:14:40,219 --> 00:14:40,586
OBAMA.

393
00:14:40,586 --> 00:14:43,355
THEY TOLD US 1% GROWTH WAS THE

394
00:14:43,355 --> 00:14:44,824
NEW NORMAL FOR THE UNITED STATES

395
00:14:44,824 --> 00:14:47,293
AND WE SHOULD ACCEPT IT.

396
00:14:47,293 --> 00:14:49,862
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER.

397
00:14:49,862 --> 00:14:54,700
13 MILLION MORE AMERICANS UNDER

398
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,402
FOOD STAMPS UNDER OBAMA.

399
00:14:56,402 --> 00:14:58,838
THE WORST RECOVERY SINCE THE

400
00:14:58,838 --> 00:15:00,673
'40s.

401
00:15:00,673 --> 00:15:03,776
THE LOWEST HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE IN

402
00:15:03,776 --> 00:15:06,645
51 YEARS AND THE DOUBLING OF OUR

403
00:15:06,645 --> 00:15:09,515
NATIONAL DEBT THAT PRESIDENT

404
00:15:09,515 --> 00:15:12,418
OBAMA SAID IRRESPONSIBLE.

405
00:15:12,418 --> 00:15:14,987
THANK GOD THE ERA OF FAILURE

406
00:15:14,987 --> 00:15:17,723
UNDER OBAMA IS OVER AND

407
00:15:17,723 --> 00:15:19,892
AMERICA'S ECONOMY IS AFTER 501

408
00:15:19,892 --> 00:15:22,428
DAYS OF TRUMP BOOMING.
