TODAY MARKS
THE FIVE YEARS ANNIVERSARY OF
THE TRAGIC SANDY HOOK SHOOTING.
ON THAT DAY, EVEN THOUGH IT'S
BEEN FIVE YEARS I STILL REMEMBER
WHEN WE SAW THE BREAKING NEWS
AND WHEN WE DID THAT SHOW.
I
CAN'T BELIEVE THE FIVE YEARS OF
GONE BY BUT ON THAT DAY, 20
CHILDREN AND SIX TEACHERS WERE
KILLED.
HEAR THEIR PICTURES.
THOSE CHILDREN ARE INCREDIBLY
YOUNG.
SO YOUNG.
THE THING THAT GOT TO ME IS
THAT THEY WOULD'VE BEEN
SIXTH-GRADERS TODAY.
THEY WOULD BE DEVELOPING
PERSONALITIES AND INTERESTS,
HAVING IDEAS ABOUT WHAT THEY
WOULD WANT TO GO ON TO DO IN
THEIR CAREERS MAYBE.
UNFORTUNATELY NOT, THEIR LIVES
WERE TAKEN THANKS TO A MONSTER.
HERE ARE THEIR NAMES.
WE
HOPEFULLY WILL NOT FORGET THEM.
IT IS ONE OF THE REASONS ON DAYS
LIKE THIS WE LIKE TO LOOK BACK
AND RECOGNIZE THOSE WHO WERE
TAKEN FROM US.
YOU SEE THE
CHILDREN'S NAMES AND THEN AT THE
NAME AND, THE NAMES OF THE
TEACHERS AND THANKFULLY, BECAUSE
IT'S AN ANNIVERSARY, THERE IS A
LOT OF CONVERSATION ON SOCIAL
MEDIA, PROFILES OF THE CHILDREN
IN THE TEACHERS.
SOME DETAILS
ABOUT THE LIVESTOCK I SAW JAKE
TAPPER WAS TWEETING ON
INDIVIDUAL FACTS ON THEM DIET IS
IMPORTANT THAT WE DO REMEMBER
THE VICTIMS BUT WE DO TO
RECOGNIZE THE SAME TIME THAT
WHILE A CERTAIN GROUP OF PEOPLE
WILL LOOK BACK AND THINK ABOUT
THIS, MANY WON'T AND MANY MORE
WON'T ACT AND SO IT IS NOT
REALLY A SURPRISE THAT IN THE
FIVE YEARS SINCE THAT THERE HAVE
BEEN AT LEAST 1576 MASS
SHOOTINGS WITH AT LEAST 1788
PEOPLE KILLED AND OVER 6000
WOUNDED AS WELL.
AND THOSE MASS
SHOOTINGS, THE WOUNDING'S IN
SOME WAYS CAN BE ALMOST AS
TERRIBLE AS DUST THAT WERE
TALKING ABOUT IN SOME CASES
WOUNDS BY ASSAULT RIFLES,
DREADFUL LIFE-CHANGING WOUNDS.
THAT IS GENERALLY, BUT EVEN IF
WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO
SOMETHING LIKE SANDY HOOK:
THAT IS ONE FATALLY SHOT EVERY
44 HOURS, THE EQUIVALENT OF
EVERY OTHER DAY.
THIS IS BEEN
ALLOWED TO HAPPEN BECAUSE TOO
MANY PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY PEOPLE
IN POWER IN THIS COUNTRY DO NOT
LOOK BACK ON SANDY HOGAN
REMEMBER WHAT A TRAGEDY IT WAS A
DREAM OF NEVER HAVING SOMETHING
LIKE THAT HAPPEN AGAIN.
VERY
OFTEN THEIR THINKING ABOUT THEIR
DONORS WHETHER THEY'RE FROM THE
NRA OR CONSERVATIVE
ORGANIZATIONS YOU DON'T SEE ANY
KIND OF GUN CONTROL DIVE WE
COULD BRING THIS UP, HARPER'S
PUT OUT A TWEET TODAY TALKING
ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES.
IS NOT TO 
SAY WE HAVEN'T
ACHIEVED ANYTHING.
THERE HAS
BEEN POSITIVE NEWS AND
LEGISLATION IN SOME STATES
BUT TYPICALLY THE ONES ARE
ALREADY DOING BETTER WHEN
IT COMES TO GUN CONTROL THE.
WE SHOULD CIRCLING THIS BY
ITS PROPER NAME.
IT WAS THE
SANDY HOOK MASSACRE AND WE ARE
ALLOWING MASSACRE AFTER MASSACRE
AFTER MASSACRE AND WE ARE
ALLOWING THESE FOLKS TO
TERRORIZE US AND I DON'T JUST
MEAN THE SHOOTERS, I MEAN THE
LOBBYISTS AND THE POLITICIANS
THAT ENABLE THE SHOOTERS, THAT
BASICALLY PUT THOSE WEAPONS IN
THEIR HANDS AND SAY, HAVE AT IT.
YOU THINK IN THIS COUNTRY
THERE'S NOT A SIGNIFICANT
PORTION THE HAS MENTAL ISSUES,
THAT IS OTHERWISE CRAZED.
SOME
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH VIOLENCE
BUT A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE
WHO HAVE MENTAL ISSUES OR
VIOLENT.
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
A VERY BIG NUMBER.
DOESN'T HAVE
TO BE A VERY BIG NUMBER AT ALL
TO PRODUCE 1700 MASS SHOOTINGS
SINCE SANDY HOOK IN THE LAST
FIVE YEARS.
HOW MANY MASSACRES
ARE WE GOING TO ALLOW BEFORE WE
DO SOMETHING AND THE ANSWER IS
THOUSANDS.
YES, AND IT HAS ONLY GOTTEN
WORSE.
ORLANDO WAS A BIGGER
NUMBER AND VEGAS WAS AN EVEN
BIGGER NUMBER AND OUR
POLITICIANS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO
REPRESENT US INSTEAD OF COURSE
REPRESENT THEIR DONORS AND THEY
COLLECTIVELY ARE SAYING WE DO
NOT CARE.
WE DON'T CARE TO
THOSE KIDS DIE.
WE DO NOT CARE
THAT WE HAVE NONSTOP MASSACRES
ALMOST ONE-A-DAY IN THIS COUNTRY
AND WE'RE NEVER GOING TO PROTECT
THE CITIZENS BECAUSE WE GET PAID
BY THE NRA.
WE DO WANT TO AT LEAST TALK
ABOUT, THERE WERE TENS OF THE
LAST YEARS TO DO SOMETHING TO
TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE
SPECIFIC, THE MOST EGREGIOUS
MASS SHOOTINGS, SO WE ARE HAVING
UNFORTUNATELY A PROBLEM WITH ONE
OF OUR GRAPHICS BUT JOE MANSION
ALONG WITH ONE OTHER SENATOR IN
THE WAKE OF SANDY HOOK PUT
FORWARD A BILL THAT WOULD'VE
REQUIRED BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR
ALL PRIVATE GUNSHOT TRANSFERS
RATHER THAN SIMPLY THROUGH THE
FEDERAL SYSTEMS AND
UNFORTUNATELY, THANKS TO AN
INCREDIBLY DECEPTIVE SMEAR
CAMPAIGN BY THE NRA THAT DID NOT
PASS.
AT THE TIME BARACK OBAMA
SAID THIS:
IN FACT, THE BILL 
WOULD'VE
STRENGTHENED THE LEGAL
PROHIBITIONS AGAINST ANY SORT OF
ORGANIZED FEDERAL REGISTRY WHILE
ALLOWING BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR
PRIVATE GUN TRANSFERS SO
THAT DIED.
IN 
THAT CASE DEMOCRATS AND
REPUBLICANS, THINGS AGAIN IN NO
SMALL PART TO AN ORGANIZED
LOBBYING CAMPAIGN BY THE NRA AND
OTHER PRO-GUN ORGANIZATIONS
VOTED THAT DOWN AND SO NO
ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN AGAIN AFTER
SANDY HOOK AND MOST RECENTLY,
AFTER THE VEGAS MASSACRE THAT WE
TALKED ABOUT IN WHICH, THANKS IN
NO SMALL PART TO BUMP STOCKS,
THE ABILITY TO TURN A
SEMIAUTOMATIC
WEAPON INTO FUNCTIONALLY AN
AUTOMATIC FIREARM WE HAD:
MONTHS ARE GOING BY AND YOU CAN
BUY THESE AND REPLICATE THE
LAS VEGAS MASKER.
THE FEDERAL BACKGROUND CHECK
LAW THAT JOHN MENTIONED FIRST
HAD AND 93% APPROVAL.
IF YOU
CAN'T PASS SOMETHING IN A
SO-CALLED DEMOCRACY THAT HAS A
93% APPROVAL, YOU MIGHT NOT BE
IN 
A DEMOCRACY.
