00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,402
PEOPLE WERE SAYING ON A SCALE OF

191
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:17,336
ONE TO 10, 10 BEING EXTREMELY

192
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:20,406
DAMAGING, 23.

193
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:21,207
IRELAND HAS 140,000 PEOPLE

194
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:24,110
EMPLOYED BY U.S. TECH COMPANIES

195
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:29,215
AND THE RISK IS THEY START TO BE

196
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:32,051
PUT AT RISK AND IT CEASES TO BE

197
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:32,852
THE PLACE WHERE COMPANIES MIGHT

198
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:38,291
GO IF THEY GO TO EUROPE.

199
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,359
IRELAND IS ABOUT 180 ILION EUROS

200
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,928
IN DEBT, SO THIS WILL GO TOWARD

201
00:07:42,928 --> 00:07:45,465
PAYING THAT OFF.

202
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,368
WHY SHOULD I SUBSIDIZE APPLE TO

203
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:52,371
HAVE 5500 JOBS IN IRELAND?

204
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:56,509
EMILY: YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING AT

205
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,177
THE TAX STRUCTURE OTHER

206
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:00,880
COMPANIES HAVE.

207
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,714
DO ANY OF THEM HAVE THIS SIMILAR

208
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:02,415
ARRANGEMENT?

209
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:08,454
MATT: A LOT OF COMPANIES MAKE

210
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,590
USE OF IRELAND -- WE THINK ABOUT

211
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,259
IT AS THE AUSTIN, TEXAS OF

212
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:13,659
EUROPE.

213
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,528
THEY'VE DEVELOPED FAVORABLE TAX

214
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:18,130
LAWS RELATED TO TRANSFER

215
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,665
PRICING.

216
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,100
AS A RESULT, YOU HAVE A LOT OF

217
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,570
COMPANIES THAT HAVE

218
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,472
ORGANIZATIONS, SUBSIDIARIES SET

219
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:29,508
UP IN IRELAND THAT HAVE TRANSFER

220
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:32,611
PRICING ARRANGEMENTS IN PLACE.

221
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:35,681
YOU HAVE LIFE SCIENCE FROM A

222
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,850
CYNICAL COMPANIES THAT HAVE

223
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,720
SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS.

224
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,991
THERE ARE FAVORABLE TAX LAWS AND

225
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:45,791
FAVORABLE TREATMENT FOR OTHER

226
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:49,061
TAX SYSTEM TREATS THESE PRICING

227
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:49,595
AGREEMENTS.

228
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,797
IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A WARNING

229
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:54,934
SHOT AND MAY ENCOURAGE SOME

230
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:55,868
COMPANIES TO TAKE A LOOK AT

231
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,772
WHETHER MAYBE THEY NEGOTIATED TO

232
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:00,773
SUITE A DEAL OR TAKE A LOOK AT

233
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:05,978
CORPORATE STRUCTURES AND HOW

234
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:06,779
THEIR OVERALL SETUP IS WORKING

235
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:07,246
FOR THEM.

236
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:11,484
EMILY: HOW ABOUT COMPANIES LIKE

237
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:12,718
GOOGLE OR FACEBOOK WHICH HAVE

238
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,787
EGG BASES IN IRELAND AND ARE

241
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:22,228
MATT: A LOT OF COMPANIES HAVE

242
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,196
HEADQUARTERED THERE.

243
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:30,336
LINKEDIN, PAYPAL, EA -- FIDELITY

244
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,137

245
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,204
OPERATIONS THERE.

246
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:35,207
WHEN YOU ARE ONE OF THESE

247
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,142
ORGANIZATIONS, YOU HAVE TO TAKE

248
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,309
A VERY CLOSE LOOK AT HOW YOUR

249
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:38,944
TAXATION IS WORKING, NOT JUST IN

250
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:42,682
THE REVENUE YOU ARE SENDING BUT

251
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:43,582
WHAT ARE THE COMMUNICATIONS YOU

252
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:44,517
HAVE HAD WITH THE TAX

253
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:47,453
AUTHORITIES?

254
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,555
IT'S NOT JUST HERE IS OUR

255
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:50,289
REVENUE, TAKE A PERCENTAGE OF

256
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:51,424
IT.

257
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,559
LOOKING AT COMPANY TRANSFERS AND

258
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,762
DEALS AMONGST THE SUBSIDIARIES.

259
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:57,596
YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

260
00:09:57,596 --> 00:09:59,832
WHAT THE BASIS IS THERE AND WHAT

261
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:00,599
PERCENTAGE YOU ARE APPLYING TO

262
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:02,468
THAT BASE THAT IS GOING TO BE

263
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:03,536
TAXED.

264
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,605
I THINK COMPANIES WILL HAVE TO

265
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:08,207
TAKE A LOOK AT THE WAY THERE

266
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,309
INTERNAL OPERATIONS LOOK AND

267
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:11,577
LOOK AT THE DEALS THEY HAVE

268
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:12,244
STRUCK WITH IRISH TAX

269
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:12,678

HOW DID ESTERS REACT? ALEX: THEY

273
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,822
ARE RELATIVELY BLASE ABOUT IT.

274
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:27,126
IT'S 6% OF THEIR CASH RESERVES.

275
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:27,960
THE THING INVESTORS WANT TO SEE

276
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,828
IS THE ABILITY TO REPATRIATE THE

277
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:32,765
MONEY TO THE U.S. BECAUSE THEY

278
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,500
WANT TO GET IT IN THE FORM OF

279
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:42,541
DIVIDENDS AND BUYBACKS.

280
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,409

BRANDS ARE PUBLISHING AND

379
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:54,146

381
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,116
AUDIENCES TO THE STORIES.

382

SO YOU CAN CREATE A PAY WALL.

385
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:07,092

386

NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ON

390
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:18,369

391
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:20,138
HOW DOES THAT COME ABOUT?

392
00:17:20,138 --> 00:17:22,140
DO YOU HAVE A TEAM OF PEOPLE

393
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:22,974
TRYING TO GET HILLARY TO POST ON

394
00:17:22,974 --> 00:17:24,443

395
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:25,277
WHAT'S THE PLAY-BY-PLAY?

396
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:28,981
EVAN: WE HAVE AN OUTREACH TEAM

397
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,215

AND THEY HELP GET THE BALL

399
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:33,152
ROLLING.

400
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:36,288
IT HAS TAKEN ON ITS OWN

401
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:38,290
MOMENTUM.

402
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,326
WHETHER YOU ARE IN DCE OR IN

403
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:46,531
THAT WORLD, IF YOU WANT TO FIND

404
00:17:46,531 --> 00:17:50,669
IN AUDIENCE, MEDIUM BECOMES THE

405
00:17:50,669 --> 00:18:02,080
DEFAULT FOR THAT.

406
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,814
IT REALLY HAS GOTTEN THIS

407
00:18:02,814 --> 00:18:03,582
MOMENTUM NOW AND PEOPLE FROM

408
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,149
THAT WORLD READ IT.

409
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:05,951
IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY,

410
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,553
THERE IS -- YOU GO THERE AND SAY

411
00:18:08,553 --> 00:18:08,920
IT.

412
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:14,459
EMILY: YOU MENTIONED THERE IS

413
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:15,294
ONE PERSON WHO HAS NOT POSTED ON

414
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,396
MEDIUM AND THAT IS DONALD TRUMP.

415
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:21,800
EVAN: WE ARE HAPPILY OPEN TO

416
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,235
WHAT HE WOULD HAVE TO SAY BUT SO

417
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,069
FAR HE HAS NOT CHOSEN TO EXPAND

418
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:27,406
MUCH BEYOND HIS 140 CHARACTERS

419
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:28,440
IN WRITING.

420
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,545
EMILY: HE HAS TAKEN FINE

421
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:36,782
ADVANTAGE OF TWITTER.

422
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,616
HE SEEMS TO PREFER EXPRESSING

423
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,352
HIMSELF IN 140 CHARACTERS.

424
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,521
WHAT HAS THAT BEEN LIKE WATCHING

425
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:43,255
TRUMP TAKE OFF ON TWITTER?

426
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:46,591
EVAN: KIND OF THE SAME AS

427
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:47,025
EVERYONE.

428
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:47,926
A MIXTURE OF THE WILDERMUTH AND

429
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:50,395
AND FEAR.

430
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:54,166
-- BEWILDERMENT AND FEAR.

431
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,267
IT HAS BEEN FASCINATING,

432
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,202
ESPECIALLY MOST RECENT

433
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:59,171
REVELATION THAT HIS TWEETS WERE,

434
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,172
YOU COULD DISTINGUISH HIS TWEETS

435
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,641
FROM HIS STAFF BY LOOKING AT THE

436
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,041
SOURCE.

437
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,411
YEARS AGO, WHEN WE HELD IN THAT

438
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:08,313
ABILITY TO SEE THE SOURCE, WE

439
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,817
DID NOT PICTURE THAT RETICULAR

440
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,684
USE CASE BUT I'M GLAD IT'S

441
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:13,051
THERE.

442
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:16,755
EMILY: "VANITY FAIR" HAD A

443
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:20,859
PROVOCATIVE ARTICLE THAT SAID

444
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:21,626
SILICON VALLEY CREATED DONALD

445
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:21,993
TRUMP.

446
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:24,463
DO YOU THINK SILICON VALLEY OR

447
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:25,597
THAT WITHOUT TWITTER, TRUMP

448
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:28,834
WOULD BE NOT WHERE HE IS?

449
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,938
EVAN: I WOULD HATE TO US TO TAKE

450
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,740
THE CREDIT OR THE BLAME FOR

451
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,975
THAT.

452
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:38,410
IT'S A RESULT LARGELY OF OUR

453
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:43,048
MEDIA ECOSYSTEM WHICH HAS

454
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:43,749
TREMENDOUSLY GOOD AND BAD

455
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:47,319
THINGS.

456
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,120
WHEN I STARTED WORKING ON THE

457
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,355
INTERNET, I WAS EXCITED ANYONE

458
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,189
COULD THAT THEIR VOICE OUT THERE

459
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:52,791
AND I THOUGHT THE WORLD IS GOING

460
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:56,862
TO BE SMARTER, WISER, WHEN THE

461
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,997
TRUTH IS OUT THERE AND

462
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:02,300
UNFETTERED, THE REASON I'M STILL

463
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,101
WORKING IN THIS AREA IS THAT I

464
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:05,904
REALIZE IT NOT AS THE BLAS THAT.

465
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:09,074
THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF NOISE

466
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,643
HAS NOT MADE US OR IN MANY WAYS,

467
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:14,446
IT HAS MADE US DUMBER.

468
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:15,380
THEY'RE SO MUCH WE HAVE TO DO ON

469
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,916

470
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:26,725
ADVANTAGE AS A SOCIETY, WE STILL

471
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,960
HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

472
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,727
EMILY: YOU HAVE MONDAY OF

473
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,494
HIGH-PROFILE TECH CEOS SAYING

474
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:30,228

475
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:30,796
WHERE DO YOU STAND?

476
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:34,166
EVAN: I AM FIRMLY AGAINST TRUMP.

477
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,935

478
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:40,105
WHO HAS OLD MULTIPLE PLATFORMS

479
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:42,874
FOR FREE SPEECH, HOW DO YOU

480
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:46,111
BALANCE YOUR CLINICAL VIEWS WITH

481
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:46,812
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO THE

482
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:47,312
PLATFORM?

483
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:51,316
WE JUST SAW THIS, IN THE

484
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:58,557
TRENDING TOPIC SECTION THAT THEY

485
00:20:58,557 --> 00:20:59,257
DEEMPHASIZED CONSERVATIVE

486
00:20:59,257 --> 00:20:59,624

ALL REPUBLICANS.

489
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,232
I'M PROUD THAT BOTH ON TWITTER

490
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,201
AND ON MEDIUM, WE HAVE TOLD THAT

491
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:17,142
FORMS THAT ARE GIVING AN EQUAL

492
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:17,576
SIDE.

493
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:18,276
WE HAVE MANY SENATORS AND

494
00:21:18,276 --> 00:21:19,478
CONGRESSPEOPLE AND ABOUT AN EVEN

495
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,680
MIX ON BOTH SIDES.

496
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,516
IN FACT, IN OUR OUTREACH TEAM,

497
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:27,152
WE EMPLOY AN EQUAL NUMBER OF

498
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:29,187

RIGHT AND LEFT.

500
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:30,622
THERE'S NOTHING IN HER SYSTEM

501
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,690
THAT BIASES ONE SIDE AGAINST THE

502
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,725
OTHER.

503
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:37,696
THAT HAS CREATED A HEALTHY

504
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:39,031
EXCHANGE AND I READ AND

505
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,066
RECOMMEND VIEWPOINTS FROM BOTH

506
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:41,500
SIDES.

507
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,304
BECAUSE THEY ARE ON THE SAME

508
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,137

509
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:46,605

WILLIAMS.

655
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:15,126
I IS SUPPOSED SHE POSTED THIS ON

656
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:15,893
MEDIUM BECAUSE THE IDEA IS YOU

657
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:16,594
CAN'T TAKE IT DOWN.

658
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:21,165
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON PETER THIEL

659
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:21,666
VERSUS GAWKER?

660
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:22,433
IS THAT GOING TOO FAR OR FAIR

661
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:22,767
PLAY?

662
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:26,137

663
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:26,537
THIEL?

664
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:28,139
EMILY: EITHER.

665
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:31,809
EVAN: IT'S SCARY FOR THE PRESS.

666
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:35,046
ESPECIALLY IF UNKNOWN SOURCES OF

667
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,114
MONEY ARE FIGHTING YOU.

668
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:40,685
I WAS NOT A AND OF EVERYTHING

669
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,586
GAWKER DID BUT IN GENERAL, I'M A

670
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:42,820
FAN OF FREEDOM OF THE PRESS.

671
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,357
I THINK IT IS CRITICAL.

672
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:50,828
ULTIMATELY, GAWKER SHOULD AVAIL,

673
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:56,834
BUT IT WOULD BE A BAD THING IF

674
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,436
RANDOM MEDIA SITES CAN BE TAKEN

675
00:33:58,436 --> 00:33:59,270
OUT BY PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE

676
00:33:59,270 --> 00:33:59,770
WHAT THEY SAY.

677
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:05,343
EMILY: IT'S A QUESTION YOU DEAL

678
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:06,377
WITH BEHIND-THE-SCENES -- WHAT

679
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,945
IS FREE SPEECH?

680
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:10,014
WHAT COUNTS AS FAIR?

681
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:12,149
WHAT IS GOING TOO FAR?

682
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:13,317
I'M SURE WHEN YOU STARTED

683
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:15,518
BLOGGER, THERE WERE TROLLS AND

684
00:34:15,518 --> 00:34:16,587
ONLINE HARASSMENT.

685
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:17,522
IT SEEMS LIKE NOTHING HAS

00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:17,989
CHANGED.

687
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:21,525
EVAN: IT HAS GOTTEN WORSE, FOR

688
00:34:21,525 --> 00:34:22,326
SURE.

689
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,728
THE EARLY DAYS OF THE INTERNET,

690
00:34:24,728 --> 00:34:25,496
IT WAS A LITTLE BETTER AND WE

691
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:29,734
FELT LIKE IT'S A BIG CLUB AND IF

692
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:30,534
YOU ARE THERE, YOU ARE WELCOME

693
00:34:30,534 --> 00:34:33,603
AND WE HAVE DINNER PARTIES WITH

694
00:34:33,603 --> 00:34:34,237
OUR FRONT DOOR OPEN.

695
00:34:34,237 --> 00:34:37,174
IF YOU STOP BY, EVERYONE IS GLAD

696
00:34:37,174 --> 00:34:39,210
TO SEE YOU AND SO MUCH HAS

697
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,679
EVOLVED WITH THAT DEFAULT

698
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,848
FRAMEWORK.

699
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:44,649
THE IDEA THAT ANYONE CAN JOIN

700
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:47,618
ANY CONVERSATION IS NOT

701
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:48,418
SOMETHING WE EXPECT IN THE REAL

702
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:49,587
WORLD.

703
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,755
BECAUSE SO MANY WONDERFUL THINGS

704
00:34:51,755 --> 00:34:53,558
COME FROM ONLINE, THERE'S A LOT

705
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:56,726
OF DESIRE TO HOLD ONTO TO THAT

706
00:34:56,726 --> 00:34:57,461
ABILITY AND YET IT CAUSES SO

707
00:34:57,461 --> 00:34:58,863
MUCH PROBLEMS WHEN YOU OPEN IT

708
00:34:58,863 --> 00:34:59,664
UP TO THE MASSIVE SOCIETY.

709
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:06,837
EMILY: WHY IS IT HARD TO CRACK

710
00:35:06,837 --> 00:35:07,605
DOWN ON ONLINE HARASSMENT AND

711
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,172
QUIET THE TROLLS?

712
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:11,142
EVAN: BECAUSE THE LINE IS FUZZY.

713
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:11,976
WHEN YOU DIG IN, IT SEEMS MUCH

714
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:14,612
EASIER FROM THE OUT SIDE THEN

715
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,880
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DETAILS.

716
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,217
A LOT OF THE RHETORIC WOULD GIVE

717
00:35:20,217 --> 00:35:21,018
YOU THE IMPRESSION THAT TWITTER

718
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:21,752
OR OTHER SERVICES DON'T DO

719
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:23,921
ANYTHING.

720
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:26,924
THERE'S A HUGE TEAM FOCUSED ON

721
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:29,994
THIS AND DELETE STUFF ALL OF

722
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:32,630
TIME.

723
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,966
WHAT IS TRICKY IS WHERE THE LINE

724
00:35:35,966 --> 00:35:37,235
IT'S BLURRY AND WE WANT TO

725
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:41,939
DEFEND FREE SPEECH AND ALLOW THE

726
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:43,107
PRINCIPLE OF FREE SPEECH, YOU

727
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:47,011
HAVE TO DEFEND FREE SPEECH

728
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:48,179
YOU'VE IF YOU DON'T AGREE.

729
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:50,414
IT'S ALL LEGAL REQUIREMENT

730
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:51,282
BECAUSE TWITTER IS A PRIVATE

731
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:54,118
ENTITY, IT IS A VALUE THAT WE

732
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:56,320
HOLD THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE

733
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,791
TO GIVE OUT THOUGHTS EVEN IF IT

734
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:04,695
IS UNPOPULAR.

735
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:05,463
THE POLICIES AND TOOLS ARE

736
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:08,566
EVOLVING, BUT IT IS NOT A

737
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:14,571
TRIVIAL ISSUE.

738
00:36:14,571 --> 00:36:17,541
WE ACKNOWLEDGED A COUPLE OF

739
00:36:17,541 --> 00:36:21,312
YEARS AGO AND I THINK EVEN FROM

740
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:23,781
THE EARLIEST DAYS, WE WOULD HAVE

741
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:24,649
THOUGHT ABOUT DIFFERENT

742
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:27,585
ARCHITECTURE HAD WE KNOWN HOW

743
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:29,754
SEVERE THIS ISSUE WOULD GET.

744
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:32,289
IT REALLY HAS GOTTEN A LOT WORSE

745
00:36:32,289 --> 00:36:38,729
IN TERMS OF THE VITRIOL AND THE

746
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:40,831
SEVERITY OF THE ATTACKS PEOPLE

747
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,800
SUFFER.

748
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,735
THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE SERVICE

749
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,537
IS A LOT OF WHAT ALLOWS A LOT OF

750
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,707
GREAT THINGS AND DOES ALLOW THE

751
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,842
BAD THINGS BUT I THINK THERE ARE

752
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:52,410
THINGS YOU CAN DO.

753
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:55,713
I MET WITH THE TEAM WORKING ON

754
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,547
THIS AND THERE'S A BUNCH OF

755
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,817
SMART PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE

756
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:00,418
IMPROVING IT SOON.

757
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:02,954
EMILY: YOU ARE THE COFOUNDER OF

758
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,522
TWITTER, YOU'VE BEEN THE BIGGEST

759
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:08,893
CHAMPION OF TWITTER, THIS IS A

760
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,761
COMPANY WITH A MARKET CAP HIGH

761
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:14,865
OF $20 BILLION AND NOW IT'S $13

762
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:15,266
BILLION.

763
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:16,700
DO YOU THINK IT CAN GET BACK TO

764
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,902
THOSE HEIGHTS?

765
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:22,773
EVAN: I CAN'T MAKE ANY REAL

766
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:23,574
STATEMENTS BEING A BOARD MEMBER

767
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,008
OF TWITTER.

768
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:27,078
I THINK ABSTRACTLY SPEAKING,

769
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,913
IT'S AN INCREDIBLY LARGE AND

770
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:33,417
VALUABLE SERVICE.

771
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:38,889
THE THING THAT TWITTER PROVIDES,

772
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:41,459
THE REAL-TIME INFORMATION LAYER

773
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:42,259
IS VALUABLE AND CAN BE A LOT

774
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:45,062
MORE VALUABLE.

775
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:45,963
IT'S A MATTER OF INNOVATION AND

776
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:49,500
DEVELOPMENT AND THERE'S NOT AN

777
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,334
ASSET LIKE TWITTER IN THE WORLD

778
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:53,404
IN TERMS OF THE INDIVIDUALS AND

779
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:54,305
WORLD LEADERS AND ENTERTAINERS

780
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:58,809
AND THE INFORMATION CREATED ON A

781
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,511
DAILY BASIS.

782
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:02,980
THERE'S SO MUCH MORE THAT CAN

783
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,983
COME OUT OF THAT.

784
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:07,518
I'M AN OPTIMIST IN GENERAL.

785
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,687
EMILY: WHAT IS YOUR FAITH IN

786
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:12,590
JACK EVAN:?

787
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,558
MY FAITH IS HIGH AND JACK.

788
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:15,192
I FULLY SUPPORT THEM.

789
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:20,231
EMILY: I KNOW YOU CAN ONLY GO SO

790
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:20,564
FAR.

791
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:22,199
WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF M&A.

792
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,067
DO YOU SEE TWITTER REMAINING AN

793
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:23,701
INDEPENDENT COMPANY?

794
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:27,705
EVAN: NO COMMENT ON THAT.

795
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:30,741
WE ARE IN A STRONG POSITION

796
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:33,711
RIGHT NOW AND AS A BOARD MEMBER,

797
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:36,881
WE HAVE TWO CONSIDER ALL THE

798
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:37,782
OPTIONS.

799
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:43,254
EMILY: MEDIUM IS ALMOST A

800
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:44,088
COMPLEMENT TO TWITTER BUT IS

801
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:45,556
ALMOST THE OPPOSITE OF TWITTER.

802
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:47,858
IT'S MORE IN-DEPTH.

803
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:50,127
DO YOU SEE THEM AS POTENTIALLY

804
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:50,928
OPPOSITE?

805
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:54,932
EVAN: IN SOME WAYS.

806
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:57,134
HARD OF MY REASON FOR WORKING ON

807
00:38:57,134 --> 00:39:02,640
MEDIUM IS IN -- WHILE TWITTER

808
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,175
GREW AND FACEBOOK EVOLVED AND

809
00:39:05,175 --> 00:39:05,910
ALL THESE OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA

810
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:09,046
PLOT FORMS TOOK AN INCREASING

811
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:14,218
AMOUNT OF ATTENTION, THEY STILL

812
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:16,387
ALL POINTED TO AND TALKED ABOUT

813
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:19,323
NONSOCIAL MEDIA.

814
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:24,461
ARTICLES, TEXT, JOURNALISM WAS

815
00:39:24,461 --> 00:39:25,229
STILL INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND

816
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:25,963
PEOPLE ARE CONSUMING MORE AND

817
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:28,399
MORE, BUT IT HASN'T EVOLVED AS

818
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:34,671
MUCH.

819
00:39:34,671 --> 00:39:35,373
THEY ARE INCREDIBLY

820
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,108
COMPLEMENTARY, EVEN THOUGH THEY

821
00:39:38,108 --> 00:39:42,346
ARE VERY DIFFERENT.

822
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:45,349
TWITTER IS MORE OF A

823
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:49,086
DISTRIBUTION VEHICLE FOR MORE

824
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:52,757
SUBSTANTIVE CONTENT THAN IT IS

825
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,425
SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU EXPAND IDEAS

826
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:59,430
OR OFFER MORE COMPLEX STORIES.

827
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:05,035
THE MEDIUM IS COMPLEMENTARY AND

828
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:06,103
THAT'S THE REASON I WORK ON

829
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:06,537
MEDIUMS.

830
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:09,773
EMILY: WE'RE GOING TO TALK MORE

831
00:40:09,773 --> 00:40:12,509
ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE INTERNET

832
00:40:12,509 --> 00:40:14,945
AND WHERE YOU SEE IT GOING.

833
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:15,813
QUICKLY, I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT

834
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:20,785
UBER AND TARGET'S CHIEF

835
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:24,121
OPERATING OFFICER JOINING UBER

RIDESHARING.

838
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:31,562
THE CEO DESCRIBED HOW MARKETING

839
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:32,963
WILL INTEGRATE INTO UBER'S

840
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:34,265
GROUND OPERATIONS AFTER THE

841
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,132
ALPHABET CHIEF OFFICERS STEPPED

842
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:36,934
DOWN FROM UBER'S BOARD.

843
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:40,738
ALPHABET AND UBER ARE HEADING

844
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:43,407
INTO COMPETITION WITH GOOGLE

845
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:46,010
PILOTING ITS OWN WITH ITS WAVE

AT.

847
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:51,348
WILL GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK REMAIN

848
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:52,149
AS POWERFUL AS THEY ARE TODAY OR

849
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:53,050
WILL THE ROLE -- WHAT WILL THE

850
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,253
ROLE OF SOCIAL MEDIA BE?

851
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:57,188
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

WE STILL HERE WITH EVAN

855
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:21,932
WILLIAMS, COFOUNDER OF TWITTER

856
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,168
AND FOUNDER OF MEDIUM.

857
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:28,272
WE ARE JOINED BY BRAD STONE.

858
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:29,072
YOU HAD A HAND IN SHAPING THE

859
00:43:29,072 --> 00:43:30,608
WEB AS WE KNOW IT.

860
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,975
THE GROWTH OF THE INTERNET IS

861
00:43:31,975 --> 00:43:34,411
SOMETHING YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT

862
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:37,514
AND YOU ARE A MULTI-TIME AUTHOR.

863
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:41,785
MY FIRST QUESTION, HAVE SOCIAL

864
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:46,823
NETWORKS BECOME TOO BIG?

865
00:43:46,823 --> 00:43:51,662
EVAN: I DON'T THINK THEY ARE TOO

866
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:52,229
BIG IN GENERAL.

867
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:53,564
SCALE IS HARD.

868
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,032
WE'RE NOT USED TO BEING

869
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:57,067
CONNECTED TO THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

870
00:43:57,067 --> 00:43:58,736
AND WE'RE NOT USED TO DISCUSSING

871
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:00,971
THINGS AMONG THE OF PEOPLE OR

872
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:01,705
PEOPLE WE DON'T KNOW.

873
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:06,143
MANY BASIC SOCIAL NETWORKS HAVE

874
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:06,877
ALWAYS EXISTED AND THEY HAVE

875
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:07,644
NEVER BEEN AS BIG AS THEY ARE

876
00:44:07,644 --> 00:44:08,912
ONLINE.

877
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:11,949
FROM A POWER IN BUSINESS

878
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:16,020
PERSPECTIVE, SIZE HELPS, THE

879
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,488
DEFENSIVENESS, THE VALUE OF

880
00:44:18,488 --> 00:44:21,558
SOCIAL NETWORKS ROSE WITH THE

881
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:24,294
SIZE.

882
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:25,162
BRAD: MORE ADVERTISING DOLLARS

883
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:28,031
ARE FUNNELING IN AND PEOPLE'S

884
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,166
ATTENTION IS FUNNELING TO THESE

885
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,035
PLATFORMS.

886
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:36,506
I WONDER ARE WE LOSING SOME OF

887
00:44:36,506 --> 00:44:37,274
THAT WONDERFUL OPENNESS OF THE

888
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:41,211
INTERNET AND IS THERE A COST TO

889
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:42,012
THE DEPENDENCE ON A HANDFUL OF

890
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:42,412
PLATFORMS?

891
00:44:42,412 --> 00:44:47,184
EVAN: THERE IS FOR SURE A COST

892
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:47,985
AND AS THE INEVITABLE TRAJECTORY

893
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:49,286
WE ARE ON.

894
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:50,787
A FEW MAJOR PLATFORMS, IF YOU

895
00:44:50,787 --> 00:44:54,491
ROTTEN IT FROM SOCIAL NETWORKS

896
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:55,225
TO MEDIA PLATFORMS AND

897
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:58,996
SYNDICATION PLATFORMS, ALMOST AS

898
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,198
A LAW OF NATURE, IT IS TO

899
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:04,268
CENTRALIZE -- IT IS GOING TO

900
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:05,035
CENTRALIZE AND CONSOLIDATE.

901
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:08,272
EMILY: WHAT ABOUT THE MOBILE WEB

902
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:12,009
IN PARTICULAR?

903
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:12,809
THESE ARE THE COMPANIES THAT

904
00:45:12,809 --> 00:45:13,710
DECIDE WHAT APPS WE USE AND IT'S

905
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:14,444
A SMALL NUMBER THAT WE SPEND A

906
00:45:14,444 --> 00:45:17,848
LOT OF TIME ON.

907
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:18,582
IS THE INTERNET ACTUALLY

908
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:19,383
BECOMING SMALLER?

909
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:23,854
EVAN: IT IS BECOMING MORE

910
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:24,421
CLOSED, FOR SURE.

911
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:25,289
ANY OF US WHO DEVELOP SOFTWARE

912
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:29,259
OR THE INTERNET, THINKING BACK

913
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:34,498
TO EVEN 10 YEARS, WE WOULD HAVE

914
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:35,332
HAD TO GET OUR SOFTWARE APPROVED

915
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:36,033
BEFORE WE RELEASE IT TO

916
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:37,434
CUSTOMERS AND THAT FEELS LIKE A

917
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:39,736
STEP ACT WORDS TERMS OF OPENNESS

918
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:41,572
AND DEVELOPMENT.

919
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:45,309
IN EXCHANGE, YOU GET

920
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:46,143
INFRASTRUCTURE AND ALL KINDS OF

921
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:50,547
THINGS THAT HELP.

922
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:53,483
BRAD: NOT TO RAISE THE TAR BABY

923
00:45:53,483 --> 00:45:55,252
OF NET NEUTRALITY, BUT YOU HAVE

924
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,387
COMPANIES LIKE T-MOBILE

925
00:45:57,387 --> 00:46:03,393
RELEASING THESE UNLIMITED PLANS

926
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:04,227
AND THAT RAISES ANOTHER HOST OF

927
00:46:04,227 --> 00:46:07,397
QUESTIONS FOR OUR WE GETTING IN

928
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:10,701
THE GUISE OF FREE, GETTING

929
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:11,501
ACCESS TO SOME OF THE INTERNET

930
00:46:11,501 --> 00:46:16,707
BUT NOT ALL OF IT?

931
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:20,043
EVAN: I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S

932
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:21,712
GOING TO GO BUT THE IDEA THAT

933
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:25,048
THIS WAS BUILT AS A HIGHLY

934
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:27,050
DECENTRALIZED PLATFORM AND WAS

935
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:27,884
CRUCIAL, YET THE PARADOXES OF

936
00:46:27,884 --> 00:46:33,290
THE GREAT LACE OR -- MOST OF THE

937
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,091
VALUABLE THINGS ON THE INTERNET

938
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:34,791
ARE CENTRALIZED PLATFORMS OR

939
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:37,661

CREATE ONE OF THOSE, YOU GET AN

00:46:41,631 --> 00:46:42,833
INCREASE IN YOUR RETURNS.

942
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:47,804
EMILY: YOU SAY THE INTERNET IS

943
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:48,538
MORE LIKE TV THAN WE THINK.

944
00:46:48,538 --> 00:46:49,206
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

945
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:50,841
EVAN: MY CURRENT OBSESSION IS

946
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:55,812
HOW DO WE UP THE QUALITY OF

947
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:56,646
MEDIA ON THE INTERNET IN THE WAY

948
00:46:56,646 --> 00:46:57,514
TV HAS EVOLVED IN THE LAST

949
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:59,216
YEARS?

950
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:00,951
THE FEED WE ARE ALL USED TO IS

951
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:03,120
LIKE TURNING ON THE TV AND

952
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,223
FLIPPING CHANNELS.

953
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:07,090
OFTEN LOTS OF GOOD STUFF THAT

954
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:09,993
YOU WANT, IT'S NOT VERY

955
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,895
INTENTIONAL WHAT YOU CONSUME.

956
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:14,664
IT'S WHATEVER CATCHES YOUR

957
00:47:14,664 --> 00:47:17,768
ATTENTION AT THE TIME WHEREAS --

958
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:23,874
NOT JUST LIKE VIDEO, BUT THIS

959
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:24,608
EXPERIENCE OF SHOW ME SOME

960
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:26,043
STUFF.

961
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:30,214
WHEREAS TV HAS EVOLVED AND WE

962
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:32,783
SIT DOWN AND WE LOOK AT OUR DVR

963
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:38,355
OR NETFLIX AND WE HAVE A LIMITED

964
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,056
SELECTION OF HIGHLY CURATED

965
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:39,423
SHOWS.

966
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:42,993
AS A RESULT, THOSE SHOWS HAVE

967
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:43,794
GOTTEN HIGHER QUALITY AND TELL

968
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:46,196
MORE COMPLEX STORIES AND YOU

969
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:46,997
CONSUME THEM FROM BEGINNING TO

970
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:48,165
END.

971
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:50,734
THE BUSINESS MODELS HAVE

972
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:58,608
IMPROVED AS WELL.

973
00:47:58,608 --> 00:47:59,409
THE MECHANISM MATTERS A LOT.

974
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:04,248
THE ABILITY FORD DVR'S AND THAT

975
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:06,550
HAS CHANGED THE BUSINESS MODEL

976
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,586
OF THE CONTENT.

977
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:10,420
I THINK IT'S EARLY DAYS IN

978
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,089
CONTENT AND MEDIA ON THE

979
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:14,958
INTERNET AND IF WE CAN INVENT

980
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:19,262
THE NEW DISTRIBUTION AND

981
00:48:19,262 --> 00:48:19,996
CONSUMPTION MODELS, WE CAN

982
00:48:19,996 --> 00:48:21,298
CHANGE EVERYTHING.

983
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:26,369
EMILY: DO YOU SEE APPLE, GOOGLE

984
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:27,170
AND FACEBOOK GETTING BIGGER AND

985
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:32,642
STRONGER OR WILL OTHER COMPANIES

986
00:48:32,642 --> 00:48:33,510
BREAK THROUGH AND WE JUST CAN'T

987
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:37,147
IMAGINE IT? EMILY: IN THE LAST

988
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:38,582
EIGHT YEARS OF THE OBAMA

989
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:39,416
ADMINISTRATION, YOU HAD VERY

990
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,451
WEAK ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT.

991
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:42,919
I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WHETHER

992
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:43,587
THAT CHANGES IN THE NEXT

993
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,055
ADMINISTRATION?

994
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:48,325
WE'VE SEEN SOME PUSHBACK, EVEN

995
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:49,025
TODAY IN EUROPE ON LARGE

996
00:48:49,025 --> 00:48:51,628
TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES.

997
00:48:51,628 --> 00:48:53,463
THAT'S PROBABLY A BIG PART OF IT

998
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:56,299
AND THESE COMPANIES GET MORE AND

999
00:48:56,299 --> 00:48:57,601
MORE SUCCESSFUL AND POWERFUL

1000
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,403

TO THE EXTENT WE BUY NEW MODELS,

1008
00:49:16,419 --> 00:49:18,655

BRAD: THERE'S THIS MIGRATION

1013

1016
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:40,510

FIRST, GIVEN EVERYTHING YOU HAVE

EVAN: WHAT I USUALLY TELL PEOPLE

1108
00:55:11,774 --> 00:55:12,575
WHEN I START TALKING TO THEM IS

1109
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:13,843
SIMPLIFY AND FOCUS.

1110
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:18,448

IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THE GRAND

SUCCESSFUL YOU CAN BE AND HOW

1114
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:30,660
