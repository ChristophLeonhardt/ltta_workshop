happy equal payday on April 10th there is a holiday that allows the entire world to virtue signal and push an agenda based solely on a proven lie vomited up at nauseam by political activists and what separates this made-up holiday from others like say Kwanzaa which was made up in the 60s by a Marxist nationalist who was later convicted of kidnapping and torturing women is that this holiday allows businesses to jump on this divisive holiday and give promotions and discounts of 20% to really stick it to the man I've been Davies this is pure Hollywood this is so stupid I hardly know where to begin first off the gender pay gap is a lie yes if you had of all the money made and divide it out by just men and women what they make equally then yes it'll be about 20% higher for men however this doesn't take into fact anything that goes into the actual workplace likes a choice of job hours worked and time off convenient well let's take Lumberjacks for example say they make more money than full-time house cleaners Lumberjacks are mainly men and full-time cleaners are mainly women not to mention the fact that Lumberjacks will make on average more money in the average house cleaner the only examples these random activists will throw at you are random pieces of anecdotal evidence like with this one guy made more money in this one girl not taking in fact any of the history with the company and the work this person put in to that said job for example I did the story on Inu so they were criticized because Jason Kenney was making more money than his co-host but turns out they didn't take him with fact all the other jobs that he does for enews how he was their number one employee and how he had been there for years before this new woman who came in and they conveniently forgot to mention that his previous co-host who had worked there for years before was paid way more than him and she was a female but that's that's that doesn't matter here's why this is detrimental first off this allows companies to seem virtuous for perpetuating an ideological lie while seeming virtuous to the public not on my watch companies like adidas Luna bars and lyft all do this Glyph gave free rides to people going to the March for our live protests which we're also protesting the Second Amendment and give money to Planned Parenthood every year and this insane belief is so divisive and instills a sense of victimhood in both young and old women alike but what's worse is that this also cements a feeling of disdain and malevolence towards men in the workplace and their lives stop this insanity and speak truth into this insane and divisive lie happy equal pay day I've been days this is pure Hollywood in awesome news like super awesome news you can now download the rebel media app and you can take me with you and have access to the entire rebel lineup you
