1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,070
I find it quite remarkable how one

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,780
mundane experience i once had on my

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,790
commute time from work turned out to be

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,099
a profound metaphor for society as a

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:17,430
whole before telling the story<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should</font>

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,810
let you know that I was invited on the

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,119
401 show this week to give some basic

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,100
advice on dealing with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dark sides of</font>

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,890
social<font color="#CCCCCC"> media so afterwards please check</font>

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,050
that video out if you'd be so kind once

11
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,090
upon a<font color="#CCCCCC"> time on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an average evening after</font>

12
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,130
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> I boarded my train home at</font>

13
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,170
Paddington Station in London and as

14
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">usual I managed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get a seat because I</font>

15
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,320
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> just missed the previous fast</font>

16
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,000
train home so I end up having to wait 30

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,350
minutes and then get ahead of the crowd

18
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,760
as a trainer eyes in the station<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,989
the national rail app gives you advance

20
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:44,550
warning you know what I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

21
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">tell you this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry commutes are</font>

22
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,370
boring<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the train starts filling up</font>

23
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,480
with people in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten minutes leading</font>

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,219
up to departure once all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chairs are</font>

25
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,050
taken people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to stand in the aisles</font>

26
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,579
and once the aisles are full up they

27
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,320
have to stand by the toilets and the

28
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,449
doors it always<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets completely packed</font>

29
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:59,070
to the point that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're like this the</font>

30
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,480
person next to you and<font color="#CCCCCC"> even for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

31
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,609
lucky enough to get a seat it's a pretty

32
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:04,589
uncomfortable atmosphere especially when

33
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:06,600
you consider the majority of people have

34
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,520
just done a full day's work just a few

35
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,290
minutes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the train departs</font>

36
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,510
and I suddenly hear a man behind me near

37
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,340
one of the doors complaining out loud ah

38
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,680
this is so crammed he said why should<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

39
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,360
pay for seats when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get any this</font>

40
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,890
shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be allowed they call this a</font>

41
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,259
service and in my head I thought yes we

42
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:23,970
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I have to put up with this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font>

43
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,439
day and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't hear me complaining</font>

44
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,009
out loud so chill<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright but then just</font>

45
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:31,640
as I was about to open my mouth I

46
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,009
rationalized and I had some revised

47
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,979
thoughts pop<font color="#E5E5E5"> into my head wait no he</font>

48
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:39,930
shouldn't shut up he has a right to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

49
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,549
angry with the situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> and furthermore</font>

50
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:43,290
none of<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should have to put up with</font>

51
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,409
this I pay around 370 pounds a month to

52
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:48,720
travel to and from work and in the

53
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,210
mornings I rarely get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a seat everything</font>

54
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,369
that man exclaimed was completely valid

55
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:55,229
and as I looked around the train all I

56
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:56,850
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> see was a cattle truck full of</font>

57
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,329
apathy and I was a part of it now am I

58
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,920
suggesting that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the passengers would be</font>

59
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">better off vocalizing their anger like</font>

60
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,469
that man did as one massive choir no am

61
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:09,720
I suggesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the passengers could</font>

62
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,979
have collectively come up with a

63
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,740
solution there and then no but

64
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,600
it made me think about how often<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see</font>

65
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,000
people arguing about injustice when

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,370
actually they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> side I</font>

67
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,110
remember when Occupy Wall Street first

68
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,640
started out and there were quite a few

69
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,620
people making remarks such as why are

70
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,840
these people protesting I work two jobs

71
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,730
with insane hours and you don't see me

72
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,320
complaining but they should be

73
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,690
complaining<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the point not about</font>

74
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,490
Occupy Wall Street but about those

75
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,260
responsible for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the economic and</font>

76
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,030
justices that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have caused</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them to become</font>

77
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">ultimate wage slaves and when you think</font>

78
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,190
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is a mountainous version</font>

79
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,630
of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have happened on that</font>

80
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,790
train if I had spoken out loud and told

81
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,770
that man to shut up the angry man was

82
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,720
right to speak out because in doing so

83
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,970
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> made myself and quite possibly other</font>

84
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,860
people on the train reflect on a

85
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,290
situation that we all despised in times

86
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,180
of struggle and hardship we must do our

87
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,460
very best to remain level headed because

88
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,920
when we let emotions take over we risk

89
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,390
hurting those who actually want the same

90
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,440
justice as you and I

91
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,200
don't you just love the comfy feelings

92
00:03:21,200 --> 00:00:00,000
of brand-new hoodies thanks man
