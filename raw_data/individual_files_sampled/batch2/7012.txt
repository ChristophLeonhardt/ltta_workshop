this will rob for example with the last presidential election well we will talk about the City Council's that's more that's a separate form of rank-choice voting but if you we had been we'd had rank-choice voting in the 2016 presidential election how might things have played out differently or how might people who voted for Jill Stein and people who voted for a Hillary Clinton not hate each other as sworn enemies anymore right so I mean part of the tension of the current system is you could you only vote for one person the lesser of two evils it's in the Constitution oh yeah right yeah which is we're in a 1 very key point everything we're talking about today can be done without changing the Constitution the Constitution in fact is very flexible about election methods we have a lot of history of different ways of vote in fact we have a lot of different ways of voting right now like Louisiana they don't vote before November everyone goes to November ballot and the top two faceoff in December you know there's a whole like range of things out there and ranked choice voting sort of part of that we think is a very good way to vote but right now when you have two people running and you vote for one of them you've cast a pretty expressive ballot if there's three people running and you will need vote for one of them then you've left two things blank right you haven't indicated a preference between the other two and then if you only add up you know the votes and you stop there the person who has the most votes might not have half the votes they might and if they have more than half they're a pretty legitimate winner but they have like 40 percent or in 2016 a number of states where one would say 45 percent or 47 percent not a majority what that means is that those voters who voted for the candidate who finished third or fourth Carrie Johnson Joe Stein those votes were expressive of what those voters wanted to say but they didn't also get to indicate a preference between Trump and Clinton and rank-choice voting essentially allows you to do that right now so so you say well my first choice is Gary Johnson my first choice is Jill Stein but I do actually have a preference between those other two and here it is and so then you would add up all the first choices and if you end up with like you know Wisconsin where it's a 48% win state or something like that then you would take out the the folks who aren't in the top two and those ballots would count for their next choice and then you just get a head-to-head comparison Instant Runoff is what this line can Ken Canyon can be called and I'll use a good example because it's on the ballot in Maine in two ways in June it's going to be used in Maine for governor's races and actually Democrats may have as many as ten candidates and the voters will now be able to actually indicate preferences among them and then Republicans will looks like they have about five and then they can do that as well and then you use this ranked choice and independence well they this is a primaries this is all the primaries right so it's just separate primaries Republican primary Democratic primary this is only in June but quite a significant use of it but they'll also vote on whether to keep it mm-hmm and keep it for all future primaries and for the US Senate and US House races come November and so then like when angus King is running as an independent in November there can be a Democrat there can be a Republican there can be a green there can be a libertarian and then the winner as you were pointing out about sort of the tenor of the campaign has to learn to be appealing as a second and third choice as well as a you know most important to get that first choice but you you also have to learn how to speak to other people and not just engage in flaming other people
