00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,549
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of excellent questions this morning</font>

2
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:16,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">starting with a very important and big</font>

3
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,230
win which is how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I invest and how do</font>

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,970
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should invest this is a</font>

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,460
longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> question and I'm going to devote</font>

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,740
a special series of videos to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,119
week to explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> really why but the</font>

8
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,179
answer is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

9
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:31,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">Wall Street learning a ton while i was</font>

10
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,840
on Wall Street<font color="#E5E5E5"> about stock picking and</font>

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,700
how lots of professional investors work

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,530
and so forth then spending a lot of time

13
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,629
off Wall Street thinking about the best

14
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,579
ways for individuals to invest not

15
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,710
professionals ultimately came<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,450
conclusion that there is a right answer

17
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,550
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vast majority of individual</font>

18
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,989
investors and that is to own a portfolio

19
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:54,780
often rebalanced of<font color="#E5E5E5"> low-cost tax</font>

20
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,329
efficient index funds and so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

21
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:00,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">I do it's a long answer as to why that</font>

22
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,789
is but the short answer is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

23
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:04,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple math will tell you that the</font>

24
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,840
majority of investors will underperform

25
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,729
the market because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the market is the</font>

26
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,860
average once you add the costs of

27
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,780
investing and those costs include the

28
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're paying your mutual fund</font>

29
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">manager or the time you're spending</font>

30
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,420
watching Jim Cramer or the time you're

31
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,400
spending research and so forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,619
include all those costs tremendously

33
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,960
hard to be in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> small percentage of</font>

34
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,939
investors who actually outperform the

35
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,460
market and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that the general</font>

36
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,500
mistake that most individuals make is

37
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,140
they vastly underestimate how hard it is

38
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,110
to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are some individuals</font>

39
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,299
who over time have outperformed the

40
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,189
market but it is extraordinarily

41
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,659
difficult and please never forget that

42
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">your competition is the equivalent of</font>

43
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,680
the Super Bowl team you are playing

44
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,840
directly against them when you try to

45
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">beat the market</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have to do</font>

46
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,070
that you can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I'm going to own</font>

47
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,930
the market I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to rebalance if you</font>

48
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,850
do it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a discipline way you can take</font>

49
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,649
all the emotion out of it ultimately

50
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:04,500
over the long term study after study has

51
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,149
suggested that that's a much smarter way

52
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:07,409
of investing than trying to pick a

53
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:09,179
mutual fund or trying to pick stocks but

54
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,160
these are long questions I'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

55
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">those in detail next week</font>

56
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,819
is the recession<font color="#E5E5E5"> really ending it</font>

57
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,440
certainly seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be which is great</font>

58
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,360
surprise a lot of people i am still

59
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,849
skeptical<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think there is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good chance</font>

60
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,769
that we do go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a double-dip</font>

61
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:24,390
recession i think the stimulus is at a

62
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,459
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> the free money has added a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

63
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:27,660
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Fed is going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get into a</font>

64
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,150
position here where they really are in a

65
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,069
bind on whether they should pull the

66
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,530
free money and try to kill this asset

67
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,730
inflation that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting in the</font>

68
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,380
stock market or whether they keep it

69
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,580
down and try to solve the unemployment

70
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,620
problem which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously tremendous</font>

71
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,970
and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's going to put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them in</font>

72
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,000
a bind so I think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best case scenario</font>

73
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,690
as I see it is a muddle through economy

74
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,250
possibly a double-dip but obviously the

75
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,480
market is telling us<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're going to</font>

76
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,250
have a v-shape recovery a lot of respect

77
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,900
for what the market is telling us so

78
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,610
hopefully the market is right that will

79
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,930
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case but I'm still skeptical</font>

80
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,290
about that does megan mcardle work here

81
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,690
now we wish we love<font color="#CCCCCC"> megan megan mcardle</font>

82
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,160
but megan mcardle is at the atlantic

83
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,200
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do more and more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

84
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,120
exchanges where we're lucky enough to

85
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,650
have contributors from the outside

86
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,880
putting their stuff on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> site</font>

87
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,069
occasionally we include a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of links</font>

88
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,840
back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Megan's pieces of the Atlantic</font>

89
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,670
and others but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will see Megan on the</font>

90
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,319
site<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can comment here or comment</font>

91
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,600
there but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to have her</font>

92
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,459
somebody asked if Conan is the new Oprah

93
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,519
are you the new Drudge that's a good

94
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:27,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">question I've never thought about that</font>

95
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:29,519
way Drudge is still the old Drudge by

96
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,170
the way he we had a link from drives the

97
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,519
other day and it's just an absolutely

98
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,459
huge traffic fire hose so one could do a

99
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:37,350
lot worse than<font color="#CCCCCC"> being the new Drudge so</font>

100
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,720
maybe I<font color="#E5E5E5"> should aim for that when are you</font>

101
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,400
going to add a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more cool new</font>

102
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,889
features<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the site we in fact there</font>

103
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:45,090
were some great questions this morning

104
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,769
about specific features and what we

105
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,480
should be doing a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it came down to</font>

106
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,480
can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have news and opinion instead of</font>

107
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,760
luzon which is what we give you a lot of

108
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,069
we have some good solutions i think in

109
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,630
the works for that but more generally

110
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,519
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to do next week is actually</font>

111
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,260
open<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a thread in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion where</font>

112
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,510
we can really all talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what's best</font>

113
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,190
for the site how we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> modify it</font>

114
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,810
going forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you want to see what</font>

115
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,519
we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do so we'll have a</font>

116
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,500
special session next week where we talk

117
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,000
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the site</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then in a video about</font>

118
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,190
the improvements that you would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

119
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,228
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> us make over time but we're grateful</font>

120
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:18,389
that you like what you see so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far and</font>

121
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:19,709
thrilled that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> spending your time</font>

122
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:22,200
with us so have a great weekend see you

123
00:04:22,200 --> 00:00:00,000
