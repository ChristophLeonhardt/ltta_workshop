hello by Max Keiser this is the Kaiser report yeah Stacy max we're talking about your favorite topic Bitcoin people will be surprised that we're talking about it again anyway there's another fork in the road was there a Bitcoin Gold began cash between this between that we have many bitcoins but everybody in the world has been waiting for what the sovereign governments are gonna do they're gonna shut it down they're gonna do MPs they're gonna destroy it they're gonna take it down well I have some headlines here about Russia because they have apparently made some moves on Bitcoin I do want to say that these are all translations into English they could be wrong or they could not be quite that much accuracy it's hard to do coverage of countries where you don't actually speak the language because you're just reading it third hand but Vladimir Putin mandates new rules for crypto currencies and I cos the Kremlin published five orders from Putin over the weekend representing perhaps the most direct move to date by the Russian government oversee activities around the technology not only do the orders from Putin mandate new legal structures around crypto currency within Russia they ambitiously establish a plan to use the technology to create a single payment system within the Eurasian Economic Union which features armenia belarus kazakhstan kazakhstan and russia as members now we do know the individual one individual and company ex ante responsible for kazakhstan introducing a cryptocurrency and blockchain there so that does lend credence to this story there's two stories here one would be crypto the other would be d dollarization so russia has an ardent hope to d dollar eyes the same hope is shared by China and Iran and they want to get out of the dollar and escape the fate of saddam hussein or escape the fate of moammar qaddafi escape the fate of anyone who has tried to get out of the u.s. dollar and met with vicious murderer right so russia china they love to get out of the dollar so they've got a few things happening one is the crypto strategy and so using crypto and a ruble coin crypto ruble coin it's an efficient way to conduct monetary policy in the country for sure they also are not outlawing Bitcoin bitcoin is going to be as I understand that you can still trade in and out of Bitcoin mining is going to be more supervised and so on one hand any time a sovereign government gets involved in Bitcoin they usually fail because bitcoin is post nation-state it puts the nation-state in their rearview mirror the same way that Gutenberg press put the Catholic Church in the rearview mirror in many ways so there's that factor to it but on the other hand any attempt to de dollar eyes is going to put a lot of pressure on the US dollar and so people in America have got to take that under consideration many people have been talked about DWIs ation for years I'm not so sure that the the currency aspect of this matters as much as the payment system aspect and many people have been arguing about this for Bitcoin is it a store value or is it a payment system and this is why you see so many Forks going on some people say well no it's a payment system we've got to compete with PayPal and Visa the other somebody somebody else will say well it's a store value and it should its competes with gold so here we have just like Jim Rickards a frequent guest of ours who does often advise the intelligence community here in the United States the CIA and he's he's saying he said way back years ago when Iran was cut off from the Swift finance system as as soon as you do that people are going to come up with new alternatives and of course cryptocurrency is a payment system as well as the store of value so it's many things it provides transparency for an economy that you know the the rulers of that country the leaders of Russia of the central bank they want to bring some more transparency to their own domestic economy two flows of funds in and out of the country China of course also wants that they want to know how much is flowing out how much is flowing in one of the things I've read and again I don't know until we we see it actually in action but one of the things I read is that any of the crypto ruble they're coming out with their own crypto ruble according to reports but any you could transfer immediately between us crypto ruble and Bitcoin or aetherium or any other of the thousand crypto currencies out there in the world but if you can't show where you acquired that initial crypto currency then you will be taxed at their 15% tax rate which is their nations tax rate so if you could show where you got it from if you earned it from doing some work you know somewhere then there's no tax on it you make a good point there in terms of the risk of Swift has been a bad actor so I tell people with that is the swept is the global banking interbank payment platform a national transaction platform yeah and they decided to as per sanctions to cut countries off the cut off Swift it could have been Iran they threatened it with Russia and so Russia being a sovereign state they don't want to be exposed to the whims of some foreign bad actor like Swift and so it yeah they'll come up with their own payment rails their own system and they can have a parallel payment system in crypto and blockchain technology allows them to do that this new crypto ruble day you mentioned allows for the mining output to be shared as a dividend that's another aspect that's going on because again going back to these five points that Putin apparently made is that one of the decrees mandates the creation of a so-called regulatory sandbox or a framework within which companies can test products and limited settings some countries including the UK have set up finance oriented sandboxes that have attracted a number of blockchain focus companies to date so what has happened there is a mining operation happening in Russia and Putin one of putin's decrees is also talking about mining and how to that and as income and subsidize the mining energy is subsidized as low much lower cost there now when Max and I have been going to Bitcoin conferences since 2011 what we saw and you immediately see from all the accidents was that Eastern Europe predominate especially in the early days now so many people are in it it's hard to say any one nation dominates the space but what one did see is that those who have the the lowest cost energy win and in the mining sector and of course all of the Eastern Europe has subsidized lower cost energy prices because of the Russian national natural gas output Russia has a lot of excess energy production themselves domestically so there is a party a group who are basically offering a dividend in the actual revenue so you would it investing in this you would get 18 percent of the revenues of the - like - - shares portion of the mining output with the mother nodes the super nodes the masternodes okay so Russia is saying what if we understand this to be the case that the part of this mining output or all the mining output will be shared universally across the system so you could be like universal basic income suddenly a variation on Marxist theory and so it's definitely a way to share the national wealth because right now you have a you know handful of oligarchs who are able to control all the output of the wealth of the nation which is you know the natural gas and oil so it just goes that's an excellent point which I hadn't thought of in other words they in Alaska people get a dividend and the energy yes so here in Russia they can subsidize energy and share that with folks in Russia visa vie the crypto ruble coin mining output that they're talking about don't need to subsidize energy it just comes out cheaply it comes out freely it does come out cheaply and so mining gravitates toward China where it's very low this is another interesting point because this there was a money 2020 conference and Bobby Lee was just speaking there and he talked about Bitcoin what's happening in China and one of the things that the Chinese government is cracking down on why China does dominate or did dominate anyway in the mining sector it was because they were all stealing electricity so they were just tapping into the electric grid and steel right so now the Chinese government is cracking down on that so you can't just take your energy for your electricity for free to run your mining right so now this is a good opportunity for somewhere like Russia somewhere like Qatar or Saudi Arabia or Algeria wherever they have natural gas and cheaper cost Venezuela they're soaring in the mining sector because they do have they have subsidized cost for their energy and this is the bleeding edge of the crypto revolution is in Venezuela because here you have a currency collapse and people are surviving by mining crypto and 100,000 mining operations in Venezuela this is the revolution that I've been talking about for years now this is the post of nation-state revolution Venezuela is leaving the nation-state behind the nation-state in Venezuela is collapsing and what will emerge is a crypto driven Society of regions and tribes and sectors voluntary voluntary and ISM I mean it makes sense hopefully this is all true you know what's going on here because Russia aarti certainly is at the forefront of discussing and popularizing and making Bitcoin a global international success and I think the fact that Kaiser report has been covering it this was $2.00 and we're the only global news channel to be doing that the only television news to cover it by three or four years Arty's been the most active covering Bitcoin for the last six years of any other network in the world by a multiple of a huge factor 2030 times and this show-cause report has been the show most actively covering Bitcoin in the entire platform as well so and because I believe in the post nation-state world that bitcoin is ushering in and it's an era of freedom genuine globalization without Russia going in that direction because they're don't like to be under the yoke of sanctions and $1 dominated world so they're moving into another direction so here is another headline breaking Russia issuing crypto ruble now this is the the contentious point because they're creating their own crypto ruble they mined it nobody else can mine it and this is a blockchain it is an experiment we see this happening with Bitcoin Bitcoin was the one and only crypto currency and then others emerged and now bitcoin is splitting in many different Forks and many different debates and at the end of the day somebody will win a lot of people will say you know a nation-state can't issue their own cryptocurrency and it won't work I believe Canada already tried it and they failed but here let's see what happens but won't work I mean essentially because cryptocurrencies by definition decentralized and so a central entity like a sovereign state cannot issue a cryptocurrency as such but I think that there are bigger or other factors at play they move to D dollar is the move to as you point out push the dividend from energy to Siberian provinces okay there's a lot you can do a blockchain but they're not gonna compete with Bitcoin it's not going to usurp Bitcoin you could prefer because it's a centralized entity and you can't come in the nation-state it's kaput if you need it what's the word in Russian finito capito borscht I like borscht I like hot borscht I used to get at the Russian Tea Room with what yeah I saw what Al in there want you were hanging out with Woody Allen yeah the 1970s he was with Dick Cavett in the Russian Tea Room in New York I was with my parents and I had a lovely chicken Kiev and hot borscht and then I went to see some show on Broadway because that's the way it was back in the 70s okay the second half stage left second half stage left you notice that theatre reference I gave oh I thought that was more of a lefty politics reference okay don't go away welcome back to the kaisers report I'm max Heiser time now to return to our discussion with Marshall barback he's an author you know strategic thinker famous guy look them up you'll find out this guy is the guy to follow welcome back thank you nice to be back did you like that introduction very flattering all right I want to just dive right into this here so from 88 to 91 you were based in Tokyo so what are your thoughts about a Bayes landslide victory in the recent snap election markets there are soaring even more than the US why you know tell us about it well bear in mind the markets are soaring but they're still well below where they were back in 1989 when the Nikkei Dow almost hit 40,000 so you know that there is a sense that things are politically stable that they will undertake more deregulation and you know so in that sense it's like the US market seemed to love tax cuts deregulation he's not conducting an overtly strict fiscal policy but the other factor is that I think the mr. eBay owes a debt of gratitude to Kim jong-un because I think that what's been going on in North Korea has he's a nationalist by temperament hobby that is and I think that what has been happening on the North Korean side of the Korean Peninsula has encouraged him to adopt more hawkish tone in regards to reform the Constitution having a bigger to fill the defense build-up and that didn't play well maybe 20 years ago it's playing more it's a it's a more popular him right now in Japan than it was beforehand right so pacifism was the order of the day for many many years post-world War two and now recently they've become more overtly nationalistic and beating the war drums when when necessary I think they've always been somewhat more nationalistic than the the popular perception you know when I was living there they used to have these these guys and these ultra hardcore nationals they would go around these noisy bands was playing all these old Japanese Imperial tunes and and yeah and they would start blasting away propaganda at various in Tokio you know dying to go and it's it's just a quick aside here it looks like is completely freaky like they thank you freaky things they engage in odd social customs the youth movement is it as weird I mean you can buy it's all kinds of things in vending machines that you can't imagine is this what's going on cider look well it's a very odd how inside do you want to go no it's it's a it's a it's an odd society because on the surface it's very very orderly meticulously well-structured and it's got a very hierarchical social structure it's even reflected in like in the language but there is this underbelly which is quite wild libertine almost like why Mar Berlin in the 1920s and that's almost acts like a like a social safety Bell which I think helps to sustain the the underlying structure which maintains this orderliness but it's a and it's the end the two things tend to co-exist very easily because the city does function very well so does Osaka and it's very safe you can walk anywhere in that you know it Tokyo Yokohama Chiba that's about 30 million people right there you never feel unsafe crime is very very low even organized crime is organized to a degree so it's it's quite a remarkable place Wow do you have any tattoos no keeping on the Japan thing story so you know they have been now for many years the go to country to get cheap money because interest rates are super low they were okay we're changing and if so is the 30-year bull market and bonds that we've seen you know for the past 30 years are they part of that and is there a change coming your thoughts they are a source but I think an old friend of mine Doug Noland used to say that you know liquidity abhors a vacuum and that you know financially stressed institutions will go anywhere where they there is a provision of either liquidity in total turns bare yeah where's Melanee I was with federated he's now happily out in Oregon these days but he made the point that you know if there is someone offering low-cost money it will be found and you know for a while it was Japan and now the ECB seems to be the big provider of home in America when the interest rate super-low they say we have to keep rates low because there's no demand for money there's no demand for credit they say there's no demand for credit in America so I think I think they want to keep rates low because absolute levels of debt are still very very high in the US but so they are they are same in Japan it's it's interesting the composition is virtually it's all public debt and it's all alone by a large number of it is owned by government entities so you know I always tell people that you know when you're talking about high debt levels you really got to distinguish between private and and and and public debt so in Japan what's happened is they effectively took out all the the the private sector debt they've put it on there and that their national balance sheets but you know that the people that have been saying this is going to create some hyper by more inflationary type of situation they as you point out the the government was showing on its pension funds the postal system had these enormous pools of capital yeah and but it seems like aren't they within recent pass going through the wholesale market and borrowing money globally now they can't really fund it internally well you know the the irony is right now in Japan is that you know you have an aging population and you have pension funds with significant actuarial demands or returns which are not commiserate so they're kind of like ran out of that free money degree well it's rising in but the but the the central bank there because it's all it's all yen denominated debt they could they can keep rates or whatever they want to do I mean there's there's no problem the people that have been trying to short the Japanese government bond market for the last 20 25 years and you would have gone bankrupt doing that you know the the problem debt crises historically arise and financial crisis historically arise when you have large levels of private debt which is what happened in Japan in the 1980s and you or you have large a large component of foreign debt which is what happened in in Asia in the late 1990s the Asian financial crisis okay you are specialists in the Minsky economics school which can identify bubbles and you talked about Japan you talked about 1989 yep that was private debt and that was a Minsky moment everything got hyper asset prices hyper-inflated to incredible valuations right it was 40,000 almost on the Nikkei index crashed down to 8,000 and there is they're still working through what they call the Lost Decade or now law stated the problem was that there there was stagnant growth because I think the the Japanese ran a very inconsistent fiscal policy because every time you know that they would they they got these debt level up to a public debt levels up to a very large level and the IMF sits then well you've got to cut that back and you've got to start you know raising taxes and reining in all this debt which they did first time in the mid-1990s they doubled the consumption tax which of course cause the economy to go into a recession again because people the underlying economy was still in a very fragile position and every time they've introduced reasonable fiscal stimulus the economy has grown two and a half three percent then the IMF gives them this pernicious advice again saying you got to cut this back you gotta cut back government spending and that's what's caused the problems now they're basically leaving it alone well the three arrows of eBay they said that all did that work we haven't heard about this really well I think that some form of political deform reform deregulation and you know III but he also talked about getting government finances back in good shape again which was a which is a terrible mistake he tried that again in his first term of office he increased the consumption tax again and lo and behold the economy fell it fell down again but if you actually go to Tokyo right now go anyplace in Japan right now unemployment is pretty low and most other measures of social welfare education they stack up better than the US that's it's like three hundred percent to GDP right no it's about 200 but that's a gross number so the net it's a it's much lower than that it's well because a lot of its owned by government institutions okay so if you actually take the amount net of the net net at the outside the government you're probably looking more like one hundred and forty percent so in that regard not that different from the US and it's a double accounting gobbledygook you're trying to massage numbers with no no so in if that's the story then they are not in the debt crisis somewhat have us believe no I think the the Japan debt crisis is a made-up story that's that's real fake news okay so if that's the case then that global bond market that feeds off those super cheap rates is also not at any immediate stage of collapsing no because you have to go from country to country look I as I said but they're all connected and Japan is the source for the ultra cheap money I think Japan as much the source it was actually trade you know the carry trade with Japan was a large source it was no not really I think a lot of people got squeezed out of that when the end you know I strengthened to print to about seventy five to the dollar so I think more of the carry trade is coming out of more funding in the in the late 2000 the the 2000s most of that funding was coming from the US and you had a dollar liquidity crisis post 2008 so it wasn't a again driven Christ so you but you do see some risk in the bonds not coming from there but coming from somewhere else perhaps yeah it could be you could have an accident in the in the euro zone if there's another mistake made in policy there you could also have it in the US as well yeah Trump has he done well I thought president he's a disaster so we have about two minutes I will say that Trump is a consequence not a cause I mean in the sense that I think people have consistently voted for change in the US since 2006 every single election they both have changed and it's not being delivered in the meantime you've had growing inequality increasing mass Carter was a reaction to Nixon you know and Obama was a reaction to Bush yeah and and but but Obama came into office promising you know remember it was changed you can believe in and I don't think things fundamentally changed he was a freshman guy they threw the Hail Mary like Bush was so terrible we're gonna give it to this guy he looks he sounds and looks like Marvin Gaye and now back at this bait he did a good job as first couple of years who with regard to you know his fiscal policy rescue for example but if you actually look at what he did on financial reform it's nothing compared to say what FDR did in the aftermath of the Great Depression he actually counts out to the bankers yeah exactly he's in jail well he bailed out the creditors of the creditors instead of the debtors and and likewise arguably you could say that his his health care policy is the same thing it's a - it's a bailout of health and private health insurance companies so that's what one of the annoying things about trumpets there's a grain of truth in the lot of what he says even though it's it's it's bastardized by so much the nonsense that surrounds it you know let me ask you has a philosophical question that with Trump what America sees you know I'm lived overseas most of my adult life and when you leave the America and you talk to people living overseas their perception of America is someone like Donald Trump for the most part well he does represent a constituency but but Dave and ones that have been ignored by the the body politic for the last 30 or 40 years so they they're kind of a bully laughs mouths not terribly sophisticated New Yorker I mean this is what people bro New Yorkers so easily again that's another thing but yeah he's not a sophisticated Manhattanite by my questions philosophically when you even the media elite at the New York Times or Saturday Night Live when they criticize Trump aren't they in fact a little bit misplaced in that they are criticizing themselves this is who we are Trump is us we are he's a part of it he's the he's a he's an aspect of it that they they don't choose to acknowledge but I think there there's something to be said for that look Ally I'm from Toronto originally and we had a crack smoking mayor there named Rob Ford you know and and and everyone was very embarrassed about the guy but you know he had a core it's a microcosm before we had with the states we had a core supporters in the suburbs that I should love the guy and kept on reelecting him I love that comparison that's fantastic oh wait marshal were out of time Thanks all right thanks Mac think bribe me all right that's gonna do it for this edition of the Kaiser report with me max Kaiser it's easier work thanks to our guest Marshall Hall back he's an author and find him on the way guys genius find us on Twitter at Kaiser report until next time bye y'all
