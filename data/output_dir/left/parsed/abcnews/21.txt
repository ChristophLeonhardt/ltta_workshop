THIS IS AN ABC NEWS SPECIAL 
REPORT.
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP MEETING 
MOMENTS AGO WITH A TOP AID TO 
KIM JONG-UN, A FORMER SPY MASTER
FOR NORTH KOREA.
EXPECTED TO HAND DELIVER A 
LETTER FROM KIM JONG-UN.
PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST SEEING HIM 
OFF MOMENTS AGO.
THERE HE IS WITH SECRETARY OF 
STATE MIKE POMPEO.
LET'S LISTEN IN. 
>> MIKE HAS SPENT TWO DAYS DOING
THIS.
WE'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW THEIR 
PEOPLE VERY WELL, AND YOU'LL 
HAVE TO TRAVEL BECAUSE YOU'LL BE
IN SINGAPORE ON JUNE 12th.
I THINK IT'LL NEVER BE A 
PROCESS.
I NEVER SAID I THINK IT GOES IN 
ONE MEETING BUT IT'S A PROCESS.
BUT RELATIONSHIPS ARE BUILDING 
AND I THINK THAT'S A POSITIVE 
THING.
>> Reporter: WHAT IS YOUR STANCE
WHAT THE NORTH KOREANS ARE 
WILLING TO DO ON THE ISSUE OF 
DENUCLEARZATION?
>> I THINK THEY WANT TO DO THAT.
I KNOW THEY WANT TO DO THAT.
THEY.
OTHER THINGS.
THEY WANT TO DEVELOP AS A 
COUNTRY.
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, I HAVE 
NO DOUBT.
JAPAN IS INVOLVED, AS YOU KNOW, 
AND SOUTH KOREA IS VERY MUCH 
INVOLVED.
WE'RE INVOLVED IN TERMS OF 
GETTING EVERYTHING 
EVERYBOD
EVERYBODIMENTS -- WANTS IN THE 
UNITED STATES.
WE'RE GOING TO HELP IN THE 
PROCESS.
WITHOUT US I DON'T THINK IT 
WOULD HAPPEN.
YOU SEE A LOT OF POSITIVE 
THINGS, INCLUDING WITH CHINA.
I THINK YOU SEE A LOT OF THINGS 
HAPPENING WITH PRESIDENT XI WHO 
HELPED ME QUITE A BIT WITH THIS.
WE'LL SEE WHERE IT LEADS.
WE'LL BE IN SINGAPORE ON JUNE 
12th.
I'VE NEVER SAID IT HAPPENS IN 
ONE MEETING.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YEARS OF 
HOSTILITY AND PROBLEMS.
YEARS OF HATRED BETWEEN SO MANY 
DIFFERENT NATIONS, BUT I THINK 
YOU'LL HAVE A POSITIVE RESULT IN
THE END.
NOT FROM ONE MEETING.
>> Reporter: YOU APPEAR TO 
QUESTION THEIR SINCERITY IN THE 
LETTER LAST WEEK WITH KIM 
JONG-UN.
HAVE THEY GONE FAR ENOUGH NOW?
>> MY LETTER WAS A RESPONSE TO 
THEIR LETTER.
THE MEDIA FORGOT THAT.
THE MEDIA SAID YOU HAD A MEETING
AND YOU CANCELLED IT.
I DIDN'T CANCEL THE MEETING.
I CANCELLED IT IN RESPONSE TO A 
TOUGH STATEMENT.
I THINK WE'RE OVER THAT.
TOTALLY OVER THAT.
NOW WE'RE GOING TO DEAL AND 
WE'RE GOING TO START A PROCESS.
WE'RE MEETING WITH THE CHAIRMAN 
ON JUNE 12th, AND I THINK IT'S 
PROBABLY GOING TO BE A VERY 
SUCCESSFUL -- ULTIMATELY 
SUCCESSFUL.
REMEMBER WHAT I SAY, WE'LL SEE 
WHAT WE WILL SEE.
BUT I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A 
PROCESS THAT WE DESERVE TO HAVE.
I MEAN, WE REALLY DESERVE IT.
THAT I WANT IT.
WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT.
AND I THINK WE WOULD BE MAKING A
BIG MISTAKE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE 
IT.
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A 
RELATIONSHIP AND IT'LL START ON 
JUNE 12th.
>> Reporter: CAN YOU GET DONE ON
JUNE 12th -- 
>> DON'T FORGET, THIS WAS A 
MEETING WHERE A LETTER WAS GIVEN
TO ME BY KIM JONG-UN AND THAT 
LETTER WAS A VERY NICE LETTER.
OH, WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE WHAT 
WAS IN THAT LETTER.
HOW MUCH?
HOW MUCH?
>> IT WAS AN INTERESTING LETTER.
AT SOME POINT, IT MAY BE 
APPROPRIATE.
I'LL BE ABLE TO GIVE IT TO YOU, 
MAYBE, MAYBE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO 
SEE IT AND FAIRLY SOON.
BUT, REALLY, THIS WAS A LETTER 
PRESENTATION THAT ENDED UP BEING
A TWO HOUR CONVERSATION.
>> Reporter: WHY DID IT END UP 
GOING THAT LONG?
>> BECAUSE WE FOUND THE WHOLE 
SUBJECT MATTER VERY INTERESTING.
AND BECAUSE I THINK THEY WANT TO
DO SOMETHING.
IF IT'S POSSIBLE, I THINK SO DO 
WE.
WE'RE GOING TO BE THERE ON JUNE 
12th AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
MIKE HAS BEEN DEALING VERY WELL.
THEY HAVE A VERY GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP WITH MIKE POMPEO, 
OUR SECRETARY OF STATE.
IT WAS ACTUALLY VERY INTERESTING
BECAUSE THIS WAS LITERALLY GOING
TO BE THE DELIVERY OF A LETTER 
AND IT ENDED UP BEING A TWO HOUR
CONVERSATION WITH THE SECOND 
MOST POWERFUL MAN IN NORTH 
KOREA.
WE TALKED ABOUT ALMOST 
EVERYTHING.
WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT.
AND WE TALKED ABOUT SANCTIONS.
>> WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF 
THINGS.
WE REALLY DID.
 THE BIG DEAL WILL BE ON JUNE 
12th.
WE WON'T GOING IN AND SIGN 
SOMETHING ON JUNE 12th.
WE NEVER WERE.
I TOLD THEM TODAY TAKE YOUR 
TIME.
WE CAN GO FAST.
WE CAN GO SLOWLY.
I THINK THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
SOMETHING HAPPEN.
IF WE CAN WORK IT OUT, BUT THE 
PROCESS WILL BEGIN ON JUNE 12th 
IN SINGAPORE.
>> Reporter: DO YOU BELIEVE THAT
KIM IS COMMITTED TO 
DENUCLEARZATION?
>> I THINK SO.
HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT HAPPEN.
HE WANTS TO BE CAREFUL.
HE'S NOT GOING TO RUN AND DO 
THINGS, BUT I TOLD HIM TO BE 
HONEST WITH ME.
WE HAVE SANCTIONS ON THEM.
VERY POWERFUL SANCTIONS.
WE WOULD NOT TAKE SANCTIONS OFF.
THE SANCTIONS ARE VERY POWERFUL.
YOU'VE SEEN HOW POWERFUL IN 
OTHER WAYS.
YOU'LL SEE HOW POWERFUL 
SANCTIONS ARE WHEN IT COMES TO 
IRAN.
YOU'LL SEE WHAT IT'S DOING TO 
IRAN.
SO WE HAVE SANCTIONS ON.
AND AT A CERTAIN POINT, I'LL 
TELL YOU WHAT, I LOOK FORWARD TO
THE DAY WHEN I CAN TAKE THE 
SANCTIONS OFF OF NORTH KOREA.
>> Reporter: DID YOU TALK ABOUT 
HUMAN RIGHTS TODAY?
>> I THINK WE WILL MAYBE IN 
GREAT DETAIL.
WE DIDN'T HUMAN RIGHTS.
YES, THEY ASKED ABOUT SANCTIONS.
EXCUSE ME?
>> IT'S GOING TO REMAIN WHAT IT 
IS.
I DON'T WANT TO USE THE TERM 
"MAXIMUM PRESSURE" BECAUSE I 
DON'T WANT TO USE THAT TERM.
BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING ALONG.
YOU SEE THE RELATIONSHIP.
WE'RE GETTING ALONG.
IT'S NOT A PRESSURE OF MAXIMUM 
PRESSURE.
IT'S STAYING, ESSENTIALLY, THE 
WAY IT IS.
HOPEFULLY AT SOME POINT A DEAL 
WILL BE WORKED OUT.
>> Reporter: HOW WOULD YOU 
DESCRIBE THE STATE OF RELATIONS 
NOW BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES 
AND NORTH KOREA AFTER YOUR 
MEETINGS?
>> I THINK THEY'RE OKAY.
I MEAN, I THINK THEY'RE GOOD.
IS IT LIKE THE RELATIONSHIPS WE 
HAVE WITH A COUPLE OF OTHER 
COUNTRIES?
PROBABLY NOT.
RIGHT.
BUT I THINK THE RELATIONSHIP WE 
HAVE RIGHT NOW WITH NORTH KOREA 
IS AS GOOD AS IT'S BEEN IN A 
LONG TIME.
THEY HAD NO RELATIONSHIP UNDER 
THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION.
IT WAS NOTHING.
IT WAS NOTHING.
IT WAS A NOTHING.
NOTHING WAS DONE.
HEY, FOLKS, THIS SHOULD NOT BE 
UP TO ME.
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN HANDLED A 
LONG TIME AGO.
IT GOT TO A VERY CRITICAL POINT.
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN HANDLED MANY
YEARS AGO.
NOT ONLY BY PRESIDENT OBAMA BUT 
OTHER PRESIDENTS THAT PROCEEDED 
ME.
THIS SHOULDN'T BE DONE.
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE YEARS
AGO.
>> Reporter: THE NORTH KOREAN 
ECONOMIC GAIN. 
>> WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS 
SOUTH KOREA WILL DO THAT.
NO, I DON'T THINK THE UNITED 
STATES IS GOING TO HAVE TO 
SPEND.
I THINK SOUTH KOREA WILL DO IT.
I THINK CHINA.
I THINK, FRANKLY, CHINA WILL 
HELP OUT.
I THINK THAT JAPAN WILL HELP 
OUT.
NO, I DON'T SEE THE UNITED 
STATES SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY.
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE THREE 
HOSTAGES.
HOW MUCH MONEY DID I SPEND ON 
THE HOSTAGES?
LOOK, WE'RE VERY FAR AWAY.
WE'RE VERY FAR AWAY.
THOSE PLACES ARE VERY CLOSE.
WE'RE 6,000 MILES AWAY.
SO I SAID, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO
GET READY AND JAPAN ALSO.
SING THEY W-- I THINK THEY WANT 
TO SEE SOMETHING GREAT HAPPEN.
JAPAN DOES.
SOUTH KOREA DOES.
I THINK CHINA DOES.
THAT'S THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD.
IT'S NOT OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.
>> Reporter: YESTERDAY YOU WERE 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE MEETING 
LAVROV WAS HAVING WITH KIM 
JONG-UN. 
>> I DIDN'T LIKE IT.
>> Reporter: WHERE ARE YOU 
TODAY?
>> I DIDN'T LIKE IT BUT IT COULD
BE POSITIVE.
I DIDN'T LIKE THE RUSSIAN 
MEETING YESTERDAY.
I SAID WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF 
THAT?
BUT IT COULD BE A POSITIVE 
MEETING.
IF IT'S A POSITIVE MEETING, I 
LOVE IT.
IF IT IS A NEGATIVE MEETING, I'M
NOT HAVING IT.
IT COULD BE A POSITIVE THING.
>> THAT COULD HAPPEN.
THAT COULD HAPPEN.
WE TALKED ABOUT IT.
WE TALKED ABOUT ENDING THE WAR, 
AND, YOU KNOW, THIS WAR HAS BEEN
GOING ON -- IT'S GOT TO BE THE 
LONGEST WAR.
ALMOST 70 YEARS, RIGHT?
AND THERE IS A POSSIBILITY 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT -- THAT'S 
MORE OF A SIGNING OF A DOCUMENT 
THEN.
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IN ONE WAY.
HISTORICALLY IT'S VERY 
IMPORTANT.
BUT WE'LL SEE.
WE DID DISCUSS THAT.
THE ENDING OF THE KOREAN WAR.
CAN YOU BELIEVE WE'RE TALKING 
ABOUT THE ENDING OF THE KOREAN 
WAR.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 70 YEARS.
>> WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS IT 
PRIOR TO THE MEETING.
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT COULD COME
OUT OF THE MEETING.
I THINK, REALLY, THERE'S 
SOMETHING THAT MAYBE COULD COME 
OUT OF THE MEETING.
>> Reporter: WHERE IS CHINA?
>> I THINK CHINA WOULD LIKE TO 
SEE A POSITIVE RESULT.
I HAVE A LOT OF GOOD 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH -- AS YOU 
KNOW, CHAIRMAN XI.
HE'S A GREAT -- HE'S A VERY 
WONDERFUL GUY.
HE'S A MAN THAT LOVES CHINA.
HOWEVER, HE WANTS TO DO WHAT IS 
BEST FOR CHINA.
I THINK CHINA AND PRESIDENT XI 
WOULD LOVE TO SEE SOMETHING 
HAPPEN.
>> WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE IT'S
SECURE.
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE WHEN 
THIS IS OVER IT'S OVER.
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE STARTING UP
AGAIN.
THEY HAVE A POTENTIAL TO BE A 
GREAT COUNTRY.
AND I THINK SOUTH KOREA IS GOING
TO HELP A LOT.
JAPAN WILL HELP A LOT.
I THINK CHINA WILL HELP A LOT.
WELL, THAT'S A COMPLICATED 
QUESTION, FRANKLY.
YOU'LL SEE IT.
>> Reporter: REMEMBER YOU TALKED
ABOUT THE PROMISE OF NORTH KOREA
SHOULD IT CHOOSE TO JOIN THE 
COMPANY OF NATIONS, BUT IF YOU 
LEAD KIM, CAN YOU HAVE A 
TRANSFORMATION?
>> I THINK YOU CAN.
I THINK IT WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.
THEY'RE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE.
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY 
GREAT SUCCESS.
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
BUT WE'LL SEE YOU ON JUNE 12th.
I'M SURE WE'LL SEE YOU A LITTLE 
BIT BEFORE THAT.
IN THE MEANTIME -- 
>> I TOLD THEM I THINK YOU CAN 
HAVE PROBABLY OTHERS.
WOULDN'T IT BE WONDERFUL IF WE 
WALKED OUT AND EVERYTHING WAS 
SETTLED ALL OF A SUDDEN FROM 
SITTING DOWN FOR A COUPLE OF 
HAPPENS.
I DON'T SEE IT HAPPENING BUT I 
SAID OVER A PERIOD OF TIME.
FRANKLY, I SAID TAKE YOUR TIME.
IT'S GOING TO REMAIN AS IS BUT 
TAKE YOUR TIME.
ONE THING I DID DO, AND IT WAS 
VERY IMPORTANT, WE HAD HUNDREDS 
OF NEW SANCTIONS READY TO GO ON,
AND HE DID NOT -- THE DIRECTOR 
DID NOT ASK -- WHEN I SAID I'M 
NOT GOING TO PUT THEM ON UNTIL 
SUCH TIME THE TALKS BREAK DOWN, 
WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT SANCTIONS.
WE HAVE HUNDREDS -- WE HAVE 
HUNDREDS THAT ARE READY TO GO.
I SAID I'M NOT GOING TO -- WHY 
WOULD I DO THAT WHEN WE'RE 
TALKING SO NICELY?
>> Reporter: THE MEETING ON 
PERSONAL DIPLOMACY?
>> I THINK IT'S GETTING TO KNOW 
YOU MEETING PLUS.
AND THAT CAN BE A VERY POSITIVE 
THING.
>> I HAVEN'T SEEN THE LETTER 
YET.
I PURPOSEFULLY DIDN'T OPEN THE 
LETTER.
I HAVEN'T OPENED IT.
I DIDN'T OPEN IT IN FRONT OF THE
DIRECTOR.
I CEDE WOULD YOU WANT ME TO OPEN
IT?
HE SAID YOU CAN READ IT LETTER.
I MAY BE IN FOR A BIG SURPRISE, 
FOLKS!
THANKS A LOT, EVERYBODY.
WELL, NAFTA, IT'S BEEN A 
TERRIBLE DEAL FOR THE UNITED 
STATES.
PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO SEE IT.
WE LOSE OVER $100 BILLION A YEAR
WITH MEXICO.
WE LOSE MANY, MANY MILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS WITH CANADA.
CANADA IS VERY RESTRICTIVE AS TO
TAKE OUR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT 
AND OTHER THINGS.
AND, YOU KNOW, ALL OF THESE 
COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE 
EUROPEAN UNION, THEY CHARGE FIVE
TIMES.
WE DON'T CHARGE TARIFFS, 
ESSENTIALLY.
THEY CHARGE FIVE TIMES WHAT WE 
CHARGE.
AND I BELIEVE IN THE WORD 
RECIPROCAL.
YOU'RE GOING CHARGE FIVE TIMES.
WE'LL CHARGE FIVE TIMES.
IT HASN'T BEEN DONE.
NO OTHER PRESIDENT BROUGHT IT 
UP.
AND IT'S GOING TO BE DONE NOW.
SO WE'RE NEGOTIATING.
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I 
WOULDN'T SEE NAFTA -- I WOULDN'T
MIND SEEING NAFTA WHEN YOU GO BY
A DIFFERENT NAME YOU MAKE A 
SEPARATE DEAL WITH CANADA AND A 
SEPARATE DEAL WITH MEXICO.
BECAUSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A 
VERY DIFFERENT TWO COUNTRIES.
I WOULDN'T MIND SEEING A 
SEPARATE DEAL WITH CANADA WHERE 
YOU HAVE ONE TYPE OF PRODUCT, SO
TO SPEAK.
AND A SEPARATE DEAL WITH MEXICO.
THESE ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT 
COUNTRIES.
IT'S BEEN A LOUSY DEAL FOR THE 
UNITED STATES FROM DAY ONE.
WE LOSE A LOT OF MONEY WITH 
CANADA, AND WE LOSE A FORTUNE 
WITH MEXICO.
AND NOT GOING TO HAPPEN LIKE 
THAT ANYMORE.
I MEAN, MEXICO HAS TAKEN OUR CAR
COMPANIES.
A BIG PERCENTAGE OF THEM.
AND WE CAN'T DO THAT.
AND, LOOK, THE AMERICAN WORKER 
AGREES WITH ME.
OBVIOUSLY THE STOCK MARKET 
AGREES BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT 
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE 
STOCKS, THEY'RE STARTING TO SEE.
WHEN YOU TAKE THE EUROPEAN UNION
AND YOU SEE THE KIND OF TARIFF 
THEY CHARGE AND THEN WE DON'T, 
THAT'S CALLED NOT FAIR TRADE.
I WANT FAIR TRADE.
I LIKE FREE TRADE.
BUT I WANT FAIR TRADE.
AT A MINIMUM, I WANT FAIR TRADE.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE IT FOR OUR 
WORKERS AND OUR COMPANIES.
AND, YOU KNOW, THE OTHER SIDE 
UNDERSTANDS IT.
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, THEY 
CANNOT BELIEVE THEY'VE GOTTEN 
AWAY WITH THIS FOR SO MANY 
DECADES. 
>> CANADA AND THE UK ARE SOME OF
THE CLOSEST ALLIES.
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THEM?
>> THEY'RE OUR ALLIES BUT THEY 
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US 
ECONOMICALLY.
I AGREE.
I LOVE CANADA.
I LOVE MEXICO.
I LOVE THEM.
BUT MEXICO IS MAKING OVER $100 
BILLION A YEAR AND THEY'RE NOT 
HELPING US WITH OUR BORDER 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE STRONG LAWS 
AND WE HAVE HORRIBLE LAWS.
WE HAVE HORRIBLE BORDER LAWS.
THEY HAVE STRONG ONES.
THEY COULD SOLVE OUR BORDER 
PROBLEM, IF THEY WANTED.
THEY DON'T WANT TO.
WHEN THEY WANT TO, THEN I'LL BE 
HAPPY.
I THINK BUT WE HAVE A GOOD 
CHANCE OF DOING SOME GREAT TRADE
DEALS AND WE'LL MAKE AMERICA 
GREAT AGAIN, RIGHT?
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.
AMERICA HAS PICKED UP.
WE'VE MADE ABOUT $8 TRILLION IN 
VALUE SINCE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE 
DOUBLE THE SIZE OF THE ECONOMY 
OF CHINA.
WE'VE PICKED UP A LOT OF VALUE 
SINCE I'VE BEEN PRESIDENT.
MORE THAN $8 TRILLION.
AND THAT'S A VERY LOW NUMBER.
BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING STOCK 
MARKET GROWTH.
I'M TALKING ABOUT BEYOND THAT.
OUR COMPANIES ARE DOING GREAT.
WE'RE DOING GREAT.
OUR MILITARIES ARE REBUILDING.
WE HAVE A LOT OF GREAT THINGS 
GOING.
WE'LL STRAIGHTEN OUT TRADE.
AND TRADE IS GOING TO BE EASY.
AND OTHER COUNTRIES UNDERSTAND, 
YOU KNOW, WHEN I TALK TO THEM, 
THEY LOOK AT ME AND THIS IS IN 
CLOSED DOORS.
NOT FOR YOU PEOPLE.
AND THEY ESSENTIALLY SAY WE 
CAN'T BELIEVE WE'VE GOTTEN AWAY 
WITH THIS FOR SO LONG.
IT'S LIKE YOU GUYS CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'VE GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT FOR SO
LONG.
>> I WANT EVERYONE TO WATCH.
I'LL TELL YOU, WE HAVE SUCH A 
GREAT COUNTRY RIGHT NOW AT THIS 
LE
LEVEL.
I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER BEEN --
ON AN ECONOMIC SCALE, YOU LOOK 
AT THE NUMBERS 3.8%.
WE HAVE THE LOWEST NUMBERS OF 
UNEMPLOYMENT THAT WE'VE HAD -- 
IS IT 50 YEARS?
I THINK IT'S 50 YEARS, RIGHT?
WE HAVE SOME OF THE BEST 
ECONOMIC NUMBERS WE'VE EVER HAD 
AS A NATION.
THAT GOES A LONG WAY.
AND WE'RE BUILDING SOMETHING 
VERY SPECIAL.
JUST REMEMBER WE'RE TWICE THE 
SIZE OF CHINA.
GOOD MEETING TODAY.
I THINK IT'S A GREAT START.
>> JUST A LITTLE RELAXATION AND 
A LOT OF WORK.
WE HAVE A LOT OF CALLS SET UP.
WE'RE CALLING A LOT OF FOREIGN 
LEADERS.
I'VE BEEN NEGOTIATING TRADE.
I'M WORKING.
WORKING HARD FOR YOU PEOPLE.
HAVE A GOOD TIME.
THANK YOU.
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP AT THE WHITE
HOUSE TALKING MOMENTS AGO ABOUT 
THE TARIFFS AND THE JOBS REPORT.
MAKE NO MISTAKE, HE MET WITH A 
TOP LEADER OF NORTH KOREA WHO 
HAND DELIVERED A LETTER FROM KIM
JONG-UN.
THE PRESIDENT COMING OUT TO 
REPORTERS SAYING I'LL SEE YOU 
JUNE 12th.
YOU'LL HAVE TO TRAVEL TO 
SINGAPORE.
THIS IS THE MESSAGE THAT THE 
SUMMIT IS ON.
HE'LL MEET FACE TO FACE WITH KIM
JONG-UN.
I WANT TO BRING IN JONATHAN 
KARL.
THE PRESIDENT THERE TALKING SAID
WOULD YOU LOVE TO SEE WHAT WAS 
IN THAT LETTER.
IT WAS A VERY INTERESTING 
LETTER, BUT THEN LATER ON IN 
TALKING WITH REPORTERS HE 
REVEALED HE HASN'T OPENED THE 
LETTER YET.
A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION ON 
THAT FRONT.
MAKE NO MISTAKE, JUST THE 
DELIVERY OF THIS LETTER AND THE 
FACT THE SUMMIT IS ON IS 
HISTORIC.
>> Reporter: IT'S HISTORIC.
IT'S ALMOST WITHOUT PRECEDENT.
THE ONLY OTHER TIME IN AMERICAN 
HISTORY THAT WE'VE SEEN A LEADER
FROM NORTH KOREA MEET WITH A 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
IN THE OVAL OFFICE HAPPENED 18 
YEARS AGO WHEN BILL CLINTON, THE
FINAL MONTHS OF HIS PRESIDENCY, 
MET WITH A NORTH KOREAN LEADER 
WHO WANTED TO SET UP A MEETING 
BACK THEN WITH PRESIDENT 
CLINTON.
THAT MEETING NEVER CAME OFF WITH
KIM JONG-UN'S FATHER.
WHAT WE SAW TODAY, DAVID, ONLY 
THE SECOND TIME EVER A LEADER 
FROM NORTH KOREA, ANY 
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NORTH 
KOREAN GOVERNMENT HAD COME TO 
MEET WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES. 
>> AND A FASCINATING DETAIL, 
JOHN, EMERGING THIS 
HAND-DELIVERED LETTER HAD TO BE 
INSPECTED BY U.S. OFFICIALS ONCE
THAT LETTER ARRIVED AT THE WHITE
HOUSE.
WE SAW HIM ARRIVE.
HE WAS WEARING A SUIT.
YOU COULDN'T SEE THE LETTER.
WE GATHER IT WAS TUCKED INSIDE 
AND HAD TO BE CHECKED OUT BEFORE
IT WAS HANDED TO THE PRESIDENT. 
>> ABSOLUTELY.
KEEP IN MIND, THE PRESIDENT 
CALLED HIM THE SECOND MOST 
POWERFUL PERSON IN NORTH KOREA.
ONE OF THE TOP LEADERS IN NORTH 
KOREA AND SOMEONE SEEN AS AN 
ENEMY OF THE UNITED STATES.
SOMEBODY THAT WAS ON THE 
SANCTIONS LIST.
SOMEBODY WHO WAS FORBIDDEN TO 
TRAVEL TO THE UNITED STATES.
THAT HAD TO BE WAIVED TO ALLOW 
HIM TO COME HERE FOR THE 
MEETINGS IN NEW YORK AND TODAY 
AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
HE IS SOMEBODY WHO IS SEEN AS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SONY HACK A 
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.
THIS IS SOMEBODY SEEN AS A 
DANGER TO THE UNITED STATES.
HERE HE IS HAVING WHAT SEEMS TO 
BE A VERY FRIENDLY MEETING WITH 
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
A MEETING THAT LASTED WELL OVER 
AN HOUR.
BUT, YES, THEY DID APPARENTLY 
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT LETTER 
DIDN'T CONTAIN ANYTHING 
DANGEROUS TO THE PRESIDENT.
>> NEARLY AN HOUR AND A HALF BY 
MY COUNT, JOHN.
AND THEY WERE SMILING AT THE END
OF THE MEETING.
THE PRESIDENT TELLING
I WANT TO BRING IN OUR CHIEF 
GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT 
WATCHING THIS WITH US THIS 
AFTERNOON.
MARTHA, YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT 
SAY THAT NORTH KOREA WANTS 
DENUCLEARIZATION.
THEY WANT OTHER THINGS.
THEY WANT TO DEVELOP AS A 
COUNTRY.
I WAS STRUCK BY THE FACT IT WAS 
JUST A WEEK AGO THE PRESIDENT 
CANCELED THIS SUMMIT.
HE SAID, WE'RE OVER THAT NOW.
>> AND THEY GOT OVER IT IN THAT 
HOUR AND A HALF-PLUS MEETING.
THE THING I WAS STRUCK BY, 
DAVID, IS THE PRESIDENT SAID 
AGAIN AND AGAIN THIS WILL BE A 
PROCESS.
SO ON JUNE 12th, DON'T EXPECT 
THEM TO COME OUT WITH SOME 
DECLARATION THAT THEY'RE GOING 
TO DENUCLEARIZE.
PRESIDENT MADE VERY CLEAR THIS 
WILL TAKE SOME TIME AND THERE 
WILL PROBABLY BE MORE THAN ONE 
MEETING.
KIM JONG-UN THIS MORNING SAID 
SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR.
HE SAID HE WANTED A FAZED 
PROCESS IN RESOLVING THE ISSUE 
AND HOPED IT COULD BE SOLVED ON 
A STAGE BY STAGE BASIS.
THAT IS CLEARLY WHAT THEY'RE 
GOING TO DO.
OR TRY TO.
>> ALL RIGHT.
MARTHA, CARL, PACK YOUR BAGS.
THAT SUMMIT FACE-TO-FACE WITH 
KIM JONG-UN.
IT IS BACK ON.
PRESIDENT TRUMP AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE MOMENTS AGO SAYING IT WAS 
A SUCCESSFUL MEETING THIS 
AFTERNOON WHEN THAT LETTER WAS 
DELIVERED TO HIM FROM NORTH 
KOREA'S LEADER.
I'M DAVID MUIR.
WE'LL HAVE TEAM COVERAGE OF 
THESE HISTORIC DEVELOPMENTS 
COMING UP ON WORLD NEWS TONIGHT 
AND ALL AFTERNOON.
UNTIL THEN, HAVE A GOOD DAY.
>> Announcer: THIS HAS BEEN A 
SPECIAL REPORT FROM ABC NEWS.
