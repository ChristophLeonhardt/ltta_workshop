1
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:12,212
This is the first offshore wind
farm in the United States.

2
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:14,914
It's still small.
Only five turbines.

3
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:18,985
But can power about 17,000
homes on Block Island, 

4
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:22,355
about four miles away.

5
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:27,794
That guy in the orange helmet
is Paul Murphy.

6
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:29,963
He's a civil engineer who
helped design

7
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:33,800
the Block Island wind farm 
and does routine inspections,

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,869
like you see here.

9
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,938
He says this project could just
be the beginning 

10
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:40,673
of what's to come.

11
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:56,623
Onshore wind farm technician is
the fastest growing job

12
00:00:56,623 --> 00:01:00,326
in the U.S., according to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics.

13
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,796
And Mr. Murphy predicts the
trend will expand  

14
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:06,699
to offshore, sites as well 
and create thousands of jobs

15
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,568
as the industry grows.

16
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:11,204
For now, Block Island is the
testing ground

17
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:13,573
for the future of offshore
wind farming.

18
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,509
And working here, Mr. Murphy
says, comes with

19
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,945
one obvious perk.

20
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:22,082
My first thought is when I step
on the helideck

21
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,519
and you're 330 feet above the
sea looking at these turbines

22
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,488
it's a pretty awesome sight.

23
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:31,558
It's awesome because it's a
real engineering achievement.

24
00:01:31,558 --> 00:00:00,000
And I think this is a real
environmental achievement.
