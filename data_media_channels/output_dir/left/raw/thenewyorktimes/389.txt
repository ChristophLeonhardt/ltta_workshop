1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,471
North Korea best not
make any more threats

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:06,272
to the United States. 

3
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:36,736
And you know, I use
the word unpredictable.

4
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:37,937
You want to be unpredictable.

5
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:39,272
And I want to be unpredictable.

6
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:40,673
I want to be unpredictable.

7
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:48,782
The only way you convince
them is by convincing them

8
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:52,685
on the field of battle that
aggression no longer pays.

9
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:18,111
Mr. Gorbachev,
tear down this wall.

10
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:49,209
Publicly, we've been pretty clear
in our statements directed

11
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:53,780
at the North Koreans as to what
we would like to see happen

12
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,850
and to make clear to them that
we do not seek to be a threat

13
00:01:56,850 --> 00:00:00,000
to them.
