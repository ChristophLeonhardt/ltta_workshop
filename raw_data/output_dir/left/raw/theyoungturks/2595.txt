1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,389
ALTHOUGH REPUBLICANS IN THE
HOUSE AND SENATE HAVE DONE

2
00:00:02,389 --> 00:00:04,240
WHATEVER THEY CAN TO KILL NET

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,290
NEUTRALITY MANY STATES ARE NOW
STEPPING FORWARD TO REASSERT

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,130
THESE PROTECTIONS FOR INTERNET
CONTENT AND ACCESS TO THE

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,130
INTERNET.

6
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,330
THIS WEEK THANKFULLY WE ARE IN
CALIFORNIA AND WE GET TO

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,450
TALK ABOUT IT.

8
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:20,539
THE CALIFORNIA SENATE PASSED A
NET NEUTRALITY BILL OF ITS OWN.

9
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:48,990
IT'S NOT LAW YET BUT IT IS
AN IMPORTANT STEP.

10
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:49,990
THESE ARE THE

11
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,470
MOST IMPORTANT CORE PARTS OF NET
NEUTRALITY, THE PARTICULAR TYPES

12
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,890
OF CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS ARE

13
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,760
NOT BEING BLOCKED AND THEY ARE
NOT MANIPULATING THE SPEED OR

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,040
RELATIVE ACCESS YOU HAVE TWO
INFORMATION BASED ON

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:09,840
WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE BEEN
PAID BY THESE COMPANIES OR NOT.

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:17,799
THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT, BUT ON
TOP OF 

17
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:22,350
THAT Ã± THIS IS OF COURSE

18
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,780
AN ISSUE THAT HAS THE VERY

19
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,009
BEGINNING GIVEN A LOT OF
MISINFORMATION.

20
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:31,219
YOU DON'T HAVE NEAR UNIVERSAL
SUPPORT FOR NET NEUTRALITY.

21
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:33,479
YOU DO HAVE MAJORITY SUPPORT
BUT SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

22
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,969
CONVINCED THAT NET NEUTRALITY
IS A BAD THING.

23
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:48,840
I 

24
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,979
WOULD LOOK INTO WHO
THEIR DONORS ARE.

25
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:54,740
IT WILL NOW MOVE TO THE
STATE ASSEMBLY.

26
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,829
IT LOOKS LIKELY AT THIS POINT
THAT IT WILL SUCCEED BUT

27
00:01:57,829 --> 00:01:58,829
DON'T TAKE YOUR EYE
OFF THE PRIZE.

28
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:10,429
WHAT IS GREAT AS IT IS
NOT JUST CALIFORNIA.

29
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:20,930
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF
NATIONWIDE GOOD NEWS ON AN

30
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,880
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE.

31
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,209
>>THIS IS HOW STATES LIKE
CALIFORNIA WHICH ARE

32
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:28,209
PROGRESSIVE CAN MAKE A
BIG DIFFERENCE.

33
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:31,750
WHEN WE HAVE DIFFERENT ADMISSION
STANDARDS, THEN YOU HAVE TO

34
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:37,480
FOLLOW THOSE EMISSIONS
STANDARDS.

35
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:53,409
WE WOULD BE THE SEVENTH LARGEST
ECONOMY IN THE 

36
00:02:53,409 --> 00:03:02,500
WORLD IF 
WE

37
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,879
WERE A NATION.

38
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:07,140
SO MONTANA AND NEW YORK HAVE
DONE A GREAT JOB PASSING LAWS ON

39
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,379
THIS AND YOU CAN TELL IT IS NOT
A CONSERVATIVE OR LIBERAL ISSUE.

40
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:16,340
THE GOOD FOLKS IN MONTANA ARE
NOT KNOWN FOR BEING LIBERAL.

41
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:22,860
BUT EVERYBODY WANTS ACCESS.

42
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:31,709
OF COURSE WE ALL PAY MONEY
FOR INTERNET SERVICES.

43
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:37,519
SOME WEBSITES ARE NOT BIASED
TOWARDS SOME CUSTOMERS SO BOTH

44
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,250
CONSERVATIVES AND LIBERALS WANT

45
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:45,549
TO PROTECT THAT, IN THIS CASE
GREAT JOB FROM THE SENATE SIDE

46
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:46,549
OF CALIFORNIA.

47
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:49,580
THERE ARE SOME PROGRESSIVES THAT
HAVE BEEN PUSHED IN THAT

48
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,170
DIRECTION.

49
00:03:52,170 --> 00:04:02,510
THAT IS WHY IT IS ALWAYS
IMPORTANT TO PUT PRESSURE ON.

50
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,849
AND JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE BAD
GUYS IN CHARGE AT THE FEDERAL

51
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:09,840
LEVEL DOESN'T MEAN YOU GIVE UP
OR LET IT FIZZLE OUT.

52
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,450
YOU ALWAYS FIGHT AND YOU
NEVER KNOW WHAT KIND OF A

53
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,680
DIFFERENCE IT CAN MAKE.

54
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,839
>>THE PRESSURE WILL BE
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.

55
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,048
HOPEFULLY SIMILAR BILLS
AND OTHER STATES.

56
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:32,830
THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF BAD
NEWS UNFORTUNATELY.

57
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,370
WHAT WE HAVE BREWING HERE IS
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND

58
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,900
IMPENDING CONFLICT
OVER THESE ISSUES.

59
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,870
WILL THE STATES BE ALLOWED TO
ESTABLISH THEIR OWN VERSION

60
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,500
OF NET NEUTRALITY?

61
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,000
OR WILL THE SEC BE ABLE TO
ASSERT DOMINANCE OVER THE

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
ENTIRE COUNTRY.

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,650
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS ENDS UP
GOING TO AN APPEALS COURT, BUT

64
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,620
THAT FIGHT IS COMING AND YOU CAN

65
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,590
HELP INFLUENCE ITS EVENTUAL
OUTCOME BY PUTTING PRESSURE

66
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,081
ON PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AND
ACROSS THE COUNTRY NOW?

67
00:05:00,081 --> 00:05:05,970
>>AND I WAS LED TO BELIEVE
CONSERVATIVES CARE DEEPLY

68
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,199
ABOUT STATES RIGHTS.

69
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:10,000
NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN NOT AS MUCH.

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,440
BY THE WAY LET'S JUST REVIEW FOR
THE RECORD WHY THEY CARED

71
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,830
ABOUT STATES RIGHTS.

72
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,009
BACK WHEN STATES WANTED TO
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST

73
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:19,360
AFRICAN-AMERICANS, REPUBLICANS
WERE ALL ABOUT STATES RIGHTS.

74
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,199
NOW THAT STATES WANT TO LEGALIZE
MARIJUANA AND MAKE SURE THE

75
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,110
INTERNET IS FREE FROM
INTERFERENCE AND IS THE SAME

76
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:35,050
INTERNET WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD, ALL
OF A SUDDEN IT'S LIKE WE ARE

77
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,319
JUST KIDDING.

78
00:05:39,319 --> 00:00:00,000
ALL WE CARE ABOUT IS
THE MONEY LEBOWSKI.
