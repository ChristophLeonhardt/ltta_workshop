1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,610
THE PHILIPPINES, UNDER DUTERTE,
IS OF COURSE DEALING WITH SOME

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:05,610
--

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,240
VIDEO BUFFERING ñ

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:18,400
AND 
WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE SING

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,880
IT WITH ENOUGH ENTHUSIASM.

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,800
IN FACT, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES IN THE

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,230
PHILIPPINES HAS JUST APPROVED
LEGISLATION THAT WOULD GIVE

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,529
PEOPLE A FINE, OR PRISON TIME IF
THEY ARE NOT SINGING THE

9
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,719
NATIONAL ANTHEM ENTHUSIASTICALLY
ENOUGH.

10
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,640
IF THE BILL, WHICH WILL BE
CONSIDERED BY THE SENATE, IS

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,899
APPROVED AND PUT INTO LAW,
INDIVIDUALS WHO FAILED TO SING

12
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,360
THE ANTHEM WITH SUFFICIENT
ENERGY WOULD BE PUNISHABLE BY UP

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:50,059
TO A YEAR IN PRISON, AND A FINE
OF 2000 TO 100,000 PESOS.

14
00:00:50,059 --> 00:01:00,720
A SECOND OFFENSE WOULD INCLUDE
BOTH A FINE AND PERSON TIME.

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:10,430
VIDEO BUFFERING ñ

16
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:17,910
THE 
NATIONAL ANTHEM IN THE

17
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:18,930
PHILIPPINES IS ACTUALLY REALLY

18
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,850
DIFFICULT TO SING, IT IS
HIGH-PITCHED.

19
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:28,690
I AM ON SOME PEOPLE SINGING,
UNLESS I'M ON THE SHOW, THEN

20
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:33,210
I SING ALL THE TIME, BUT YEAH,
WHAT IF YOU JUST CAN'T SING?

21
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,799
AND WHO IS THE ARBITER OF
WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE

22
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:36,880
ENTHUSIASTIC ENOUGH?

23
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,010
IT GETS WORSE.

24
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,920
IT MANDATES ñ THE BILL DOES ñ
THAT THE TEMPO OF ANY PUBLIC

25
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,440
PERFORMANCE OF THE ANTHEM MUST
FALL BETWEEN 100, AND 120 BPM.

26
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,100
I WOULD IMMEDIATELY BE ARRESTED.

27
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,939
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT BEATS PER
MINUTE IS.

28
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:59,271
I DON'T KNOW ANY ñ THERE'S ñ I
COULDN'T BEGIN TO TELL YOU IF

29
00:01:59,271 --> 00:02:03,640
SOMETHING IS WITHIN 100, AND 120
BPM IS LITERALLY MY LIFE

30
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,700
DEPENDED ON IT, AND IN THE
PHILIPPINES IT MIGHT.

31
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,180
I JUST DEFINED IT FOR YOU.

32
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,250
IT'S UNTZ UNTZ UNTZ UNTZ.

33
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:16,050
HOW MANY UNTZ'S IN A MINUTE,
THAT'S LITERALLY WHAT IT IS.

34
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,610
THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.

35
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:24,050
YOU ARE SPEAKING CHINESE TO ME.

36
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:28,140
NOW, YOU MIGHT BE TENDED TO MAKE
FUN OF THE PHILIPPINES, AND YOU

37
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,190
WOULD BE RIGHT ñ AND, BY THE
WAY, NOT THE PEOPLE, BUT

38
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:34,050
OBVIOUSLY THE GOVERNMENT ñ BUT
THEY ARE NOT ALONE, IN INDIA YOU

39
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,290
MUST ALSO STAND FOR THE NATIONAL
ANTHEM, AND THEY PLAY BEFORE

40
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:44,170
MOVIES, WHICH IS NICE AND
ANNOYING.

41
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,920
AND THEY ARE NOT PLAYING, TWO
DIFFERENT INCIDENTS, THEY

42
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,980
ARRESTED 19 DIFFERENT PEOPLE FOR
NOT STANDING FOR THE INDIAN

43
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,410
NATIONAL ANTHEM IN MOVIE
THEATERS.

44
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,850
SO THEY WENT TO PRISON.

45
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,090
IN THAILAND, THE NATIONAL ANTHEM
IS PLAYED ALL ACROSS THE

46
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,710
COUNTRY, IN GOVERNMENT
BUILDINGS, PARKS AND TRAIN

47
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:04,170
STATIONS, AT 8 AM AND 6 PM.

48
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,300
PEOPLE ARE EXPECTED TO STAND AND
BE SILENT.

49
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,260
SO YOU ARE LIKE, RUSHING TO
WORK, YOU HAVE TO STAND AND

50
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,260
BE SILENT.

51
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,630
BUT THEN THEY CONSIDERED HAVING
CARS ALSO STOP.

52
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,920
AND THEN THEY WERE LIKE, THAT'S
A REALLY BAD IDEA.

53
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,640
THAT'S A REALLY BAD IDEA.

54
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,640
THAT WOULD BE MISERABLE.

55
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,150
COULD YOU IMAGINE?

56
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:27,290
8 AM, SLAMS ON THE BRAKES, ON
THE FREEWAYS.

57
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:32,190
I MEAN, WHO IS THE CLOWN WHO
CAME UP WITH THAT IDEA?

58
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,400
AND THEN THERE IS ñ

59
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,880
YOU CANNOT OFFEND THE DIGNITY OF
THE MONARCH IN THAILAND,

60
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,430
IT'S LIKE THE STORY WE TALKED
ABOUT BEFORE.

61
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,480
IN THIS CASE, NOT STANDING AT AN
ANTHEM BEING PLAYED IN A

62
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,861
MOVIE THEATER, IN 2007 SOMEONE
WAS ARRESTED FOR THAT, THEY

63
00:03:45,861 --> 00:03:50,900
FACED UP TO 15 YEARS IN PRISON.

64
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,320
FOR OFFENDING THE DIGNITY OF THE
MAJESTY THERE.

65
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,660
THE CHINESE ALSO HAVE A LAW ON
THIS.

66
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,210
DEROGATORY PROMISES OF THE
ANTHEM, BUT THEY ARE FAR

67
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:07,320
MORE MERCIFUL, YOU ONLY GET 15
DAYS IN DETENTION.

68
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,070
AND NOW, WE ARE ALL LAUGHING,
THE CHINESE, THE INDIANS,

69
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:14,090
THE PHILIPPINES, HERE IN
AMERICA WE REALIZE THE NATIONAL

70
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,470
ANTHEM, YOU SHOULDN'T PUNISH
PEOPLE FOR THAT.

71
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,269
UNLESS OF COURSE THEY PLAY IN
THE NFL.

72
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,750
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WAS GOING
TO BRING UP.

73
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,431
WE MIGHT NOT HAVE A PERMIT THAT
PUNISHES US FOR NOT STANDING UP

74
00:04:26,431 --> 00:04:30,730
DURING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, YET,
BUT WE DO HAVE A COURT OF

75
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,840
PUBLIC OPINION, AND THAT COURT
OF PUBLIC OPINION HAS BEEN

76
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,970
BRUTAL AGAINST PEOPLE WHO HAVE
USED THE NATIONAL ANTHEM IN

77
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,590
SOME FORM OF PROTEST.

78
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,350
SO, COLIN KAEPERNICK, IT HAS
BEEN MUCH DESTROYED HIS CAREER.

79
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,310
IT IS NOT JUST THE COURT OF
PUBLIC OPINION, WHICH IS

80
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,780
ALWAYS MIXED.

81
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,431
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO LOVE
COLIN KAEPERNICK, IT'S A

82
00:04:53,431 --> 00:04:55,660
MIXED BAG.

83
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,520
NO, THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY CAN'T
STAND COLIN KAEPERNICK ARE THE

84
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,580
PEOPLE WHO ARE IN POWER, THE
ACTUAL NFL OWNERS.

85
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:11,810
THEY ARE CLAIMING THAT YOU CAN
GO THREE QUARTERBACKS DEEP, ON

86
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:15,360
EACH TEAM, 32 TEAMS, AND COLIN
KAEPERNICK STILL WOULDN'T

87
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,350
MAKE ANY OF THOSE TEAMS.

88
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,930
THAT IS A PREPOSTEROUS CLAIM.

89
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:23,200
SO, IN AMERICA, IF YOU DON'T
STAND FOR THE NATIONAL

90
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,140
ANTHEM, YOU COULD LOSE MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS.

91
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,250
YOU ARE TALKING OF A COUPLE
THOUSAND DOLLARS FINE IN

92
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,400
THE PHILIPPINES, AND WE MAKE FUN
OF THEM?

93
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,500
OF COURSE KAEPERNICK WAS IN A
UNIQUE SITUATION WHERE HE

94
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,450
WAS MAKING MILLIONS, SO WE CAN
LOSE MILLIONS, BUT THAT IS

95
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,390
WHAT HAPPENED.

96
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:45,780
NOW, THIS JUST HAPPENED TO BE IN
THE NEWS, WE DIDN'T DO IT

97
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,411
BECAUSE OF KAEPERNICK, IT WAS
JUST A LAW THAT WAS PROPOSED IN

98
00:05:48,411 --> 00:05:54,740
THE PHILIPPINES RECENTLY, BUT WE
SHOULD LOOK INTERNALLY AS WELL.

99
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,550
I HAVE SAID IT A MILLION TIMES
ON THIS SHOW; I LOVE AMERICA, I

100
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,770
BELIEVE WE SHOULD NOT RUN FROM
THE IDEA OF AMERICA, THE FLAG OF

101
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:08,510
AMERICA, WE LOVE IT, AND WE FEEL
LIKE WE SHOULD LIVE UP TO

102
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,510
THAT IDEA.

103
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:13,800
BUT THE BEAUTY IS THAT EVERYONE
HAS THEIR OWN OPINION, AND YOU

104
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,720
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SING THE
NATIONAL ALBUM, OR STAND FOR THE

105
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,330
NATIONAL ANTHEM WITH THE SAME
FERVOR THAT YOU DO, SO DON'T BE

106
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:25,461
A WEIRDO DICTATOR WANT TO BE, OR
A MONARCH WANT TO BE, WE

107
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:28,420
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE A FREE
COUNTRY.

108
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,590
SO, AS MUCH AS I WOULD SAY TO
THE KING OF THAILAND, AS THE

109
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:37,740
CLOWN IN THE PHILIPPINES,
DUTERTE, I WOULD SAY

110
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,740
EQUALLY TO THE NFL OWNERS, YOU
SHOULD ACTUALLY BELIEVE

111
00:06:41,740 --> 00:00:00,000
ENOUGH IN YOUR COUNTRY THAT YOU
HAVE TO MANDATE PATRIOTISM.
