1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
there's no patent for marijuana right

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,780
it's a plant it's already out there the

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,069
same way that big firm will probably

4
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:07,440
won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> profit off if MDMA or LSD becomes</font>

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,510
legal for drugs as a psychotherapy

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,889
because the patents already there so

7
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:12,660
they can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really make money out of it</font>

8
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,130
in the same way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they you know</font>

9
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:25,170
create vicodin<font color="#CCCCCC"> and these other drugs hey</font>

23
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,239
do it it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be great yeah either way</font>

24
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,719
here's Jake who's<font color="#E5E5E5"> calling us on skype</font>

00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:56,309
Amy oh thanks for<font color="#CCCCCC"> having me hey Jake</font>

26
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:59,010
how's it going really well um so the

27
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,539
issues that you brought up you know

28
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,899
banking tax issues rescheduling it seems

29
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the marijuana industry has yet to</font>

30
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,890
gain any traction on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a federal level</font>

31
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,080
with this despite their lobbying efforts

32
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,030
is there any sense from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> industry of</font>

33
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">when this might tip or who necessarily</font>

34
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,280
is working against this so it's kind of

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,530
I guess my impression is that it's less

36
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,920
a single senator or House Rep that's

37
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,270
working against us but it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

38
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,400
kind of the policy priorities of what's

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,579
going on in Congress so until<font color="#E5E5E5"> making you</font>

40
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:31,740
know access to banking you know easier

41
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,720
for marijuana businesses or rescheduling

42
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,520
marijuana from schedule<font color="#CCCCCC"> one to schedule</font>

43
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,770
to ultimate will make it a lot easier as

44
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,140
well nothing is going to change so it

45
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,640
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get that traction in</font>

46
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,560
Congress overall or<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything is going</font>

47
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,170
to continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be somewhat terrible</font>

48
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,240
right um so in your report you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked</font>

49
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,890
with andy williams of<font color="#E5E5E5"> medicine man and</font>

50
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,479
he kind of talks about always having

51
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,970
another branch to reach<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to in terms</font>

52
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,560
of banks because inevitably they're

53
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,780
going to get booted out what are kind of

54
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of the creative workarounds that</font>

55
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:02,430
businesses<font color="#CCCCCC"> are using for 280e because</font>

56
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,880
tax code is a lot harder to circumvent

57
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,399
right now absolutely 280e is very

58
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,310
complicated it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little boring but it</font>

59
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:11,830
is the

60
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,930
is a very important part of what's going

61
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">on here so just to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

62
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,510
background<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a te bars any marijuana</font>

63
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,280
business from being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to write off</font>

64
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,650
there you know what they buy for their

65
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,180
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if they buy these super</font>

66
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,590
expensive lights for their<font color="#E5E5E5"> groves they</font>

67
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,790
can't write<font color="#CCCCCC"> that off so they end up</font>

68
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,200
eating a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those costs they don't</font>

69
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,760
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the same kind of business</font>

70
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,040
write offs that normal businesses do so

71
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,290
really I you know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to people</font>

72
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,880
the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that seems that people are</font>

73
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,100
getting around it is being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to make</font>

74
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,470
their brand very attractive to draw in a

75
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,300
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> capital so they can circumvent</font>

76
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,120
those costs that is really challenging

77
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,580
so you know it's it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult</font>

78
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,090
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get around that right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um kind of</font>

79
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,590
touching on the marijuana investors

80
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,150
summit which was a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fun this year</font>

81
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,530
it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> really impressive they bring in</font>

82
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,540
you know experts from shark tank for

83
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,850
example but then you kind of have an

84
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">Rosenthal which is almost a cult hero</font>

85
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,380
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of in marijuana circles giving a</font>

86
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,570
presentation that<font color="#E5E5E5"> frankly I didn't feel</font>

87
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">like moved investors at all yeah we're</font>

88
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,250
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of old-school</font>

89
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,000
marijuana people without any real stake

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,269
in the market<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they fought to create</font>

91
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:21,190
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean again is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what we saw at the</font>

92
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,840
marijuana investor summits was just

93
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,209
suits you didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> see people there</font>

94
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:27,970
who had been growing for years um so

95
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,160
yeah the market is really it's really

96
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,019
buttoning up again because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is really</font>

97
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:33,489
capital intensive there are certain

98
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:35,440
barriers in the way that that you know

99
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">create a space where you have to have a</font>

100
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:39,100
lot of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the license to</font>

101
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,720
follow all these state rules so yeah

102
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,890
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we saw is really the</font>

103
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,989
traditional you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know mom and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pops that</font>

104
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:46,780
you think of you aren't really we're in

105
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,950
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same space as the marijuana</font>

106
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,980
investors interesting hey I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

107
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,510
there are investments being made right

108
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,390
now you know you have art view weedmaps

109
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">High Times announced their big fun are</font>

110
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,350
there any early success stories that

111
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">these you know investors are pointing to</font>

112
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,250
and saying you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know cure people that you</font>

113
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,870
know perceived a little bit of capital

114
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,160
and this is what they've done with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

115
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,430
and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what sectors are those in yeah</font>

116
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,920
so you know what we saw that is any

117
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,510
business that's directly touching the

118
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">plants so actually growing it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

119
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,228
like that that's more risky so you have

120
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:19,540
you know investors might not necessarily

121
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,459
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be near</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but a big thing</font>

122
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:22,760
that's really happening is

123
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,280
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual technologies so any kinds of</font>

124
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,850
lights or anything else<font color="#CCCCCC"> that say if</font>

125
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,080
something you know out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the norm</font>

126
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,270
happens in marijuana is completely you

127
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,560
know kicked off the table is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

128
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,790
to be a Bible business those

129
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,200
technologies can be applied to

130
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,420
agriculture and other things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

131
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,100
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that we've been you</font>

132
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,420
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen kicking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

133
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,090
are investing in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and Andy</font>

134
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,560
Williams also talked about how he

135
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">wouldn't want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get involved in legal</font>

136
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,420
cannabis in Colorado and not as a kind

137
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,100
of protectionist thing but just he feels

138
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,720
like there are other markets that have

139
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,910
more potential what are what are those

140
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,860
markets right now so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the markets</font>

141
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,660
that are coming online so you see even

142
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,250
Andy Williams of medicine man said that

143
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">his his company so his consulting</font>

144
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,590
company medicine man technologies is in

145
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,480
Oregon right now helping businesses to

146
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,030
sort of start up so that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

147
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,950
is going to be you know really

148
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,480
interesting is seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the markets where</font>

149
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,220
first started to obviously Colorado and

150
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,360
seeing how the cove a pen thank you is

151
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,590
there another now you do that I'm just

152
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,470
get it and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of seeing how the</font>

153
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,880
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've really done at first</font>

154
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,140
how they're exporting their knowledge

155
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,520
and making<font color="#E5E5E5"> money off of it in different</font>

156
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,700
states interesting and then what's going

157
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,770
on on the science front I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind</font>

158
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">of testing facilities are coming up</font>

159
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,340
there's gene projects is that an area

160
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">where you're seeing a lot of investment</font>

161
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,990
potential yeah I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

162
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,470
until it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> scheduled to schedule</font>

163
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">to we might not see as much testing as</font>

164
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,240
we want especially making it a

165
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,220
legitimate medicine federally regulated

166
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,950
but we are seeing a huge trend<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

167
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,070
edibles and that's kind of coming up on

168
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,230
the market in Canada Supreme Court just

169
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,150
said that they're now allowing you know

170
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,890
edibles and oils to be you know

171
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,840
federally legal so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going</font>

172
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">to see American investors investing in</font>

173
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,220
that space too because Canada so far has

174
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,260
only been plant has been federally legal

175
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,920
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to come up and</font>

176
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">then final question did you get a</font>

177
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,890
contact high when you were at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

178

180
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,700
because I'm from Vancouver so my goal

181
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,290
every day is a cannabis cup in Vancouver

182
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">Canada but the cannabis cup scared me</font>

183
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,730
straight a little and for the record I

184
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,770
didn't smoke it all in Denver so I got

185
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,680

199
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,910
America until it becomes federally legal

200
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,620
the way it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is right now is you can't</font>

201
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">even move it over state lines where you</font>

202
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:15,030
are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it being exporting is</font>

203
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,680
in Canada because it is federally legal

204
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,199
and we know that it's definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

205
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,160
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up where they're going to be</font>

206
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,500
trading with other countries that also

207
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,720
have legal marijuana so until it is

208
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,400
federally legal and rescheduled in the

209
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">US you're not going to see it but when</font>

210
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,699
that day comes i'm sure the markets

211
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,699
going to blow up cool so until that day

212
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:35,789
and let's talk to Magnus Magnus is in

213
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:39,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sweden is is weed legal in Sweden Magnus</font>

214
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,620
sorry is one illegal<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Sweden it is not</font>

215
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,889
if they're considered wrong in Sweden so

216
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:49,110
how readily available is it is it

217
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,789
difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get is it just like any</font>

218
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:55,440
other black market or yeah well I would

219
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,240
say it's like any other black market if

220
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,430
you know where to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look you for the fine</font>

221
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:03,150
is about everywhere here as well oh hey

222
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,919
anyway I bet you had some questions

223
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:08,729
vanilla don't you yeah I do I do my

224
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:11,039
question was actually about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this smaller</font>

225
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,620
businesses and smaller growers in Denver

226
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,780
right now like with them with the

227
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,139
current<font color="#E5E5E5"> structure are they able to stay</font>

228
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:20,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">a stay in business or is it just for the</font>

229
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,039
big corporations<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the future yeah I</font>

230
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean we've definitely seen that what is</font>

231
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,330
the businesses that are doing the most

232
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,340
in or doing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best in Denver are</font>

233
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,289
definitely the larger you know

234
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:32,820
large-scale marijuana businesses that

235
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,860
have a lot of capital they have multiple

236
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,570
stores and things like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

237
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">very recognizable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> brand something that</font>

238
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,169
sets them apart from the hundreds of

239
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:42,690
other dispensaries in the state<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in</font>

240
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">the city but I think there's definitely</font>

241
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,990
going to be a place for those

242
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,970
mom-and-pop shop

243
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:51,620
in the future okay good I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> my I've</font>

244
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,970
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> you show it was about the</font>

245
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,300
protection side of things is everybody

246
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,399
able to afford protection or is the

247
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,620
smaller distances having to protect them

248
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,720
elsewhere than armored trucks in and

249
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,060
security guards oh yeah so when you're

250
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,100
talking about security it's it's

251
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,990
mandated by the state so every state is

252
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:09,920
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something a little bit</font>

253
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,779
different because it's not federally

254
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:13,189
legal so it's up to the states to decide

255
00:09:13,189 --> 00:09:16,430
what the rules are so in Colorado every

256
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,339
state has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minimum security</font>

257
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:21,980
requirement so the ones that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

258
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,120
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it are the ones that have enough</font>

259
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,160
money to fund it it's super<font color="#CCCCCC"> capital</font>

260
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">intensive we spend a day with a security</font>

261
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:29,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">company just for them to show us what</font>

262
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:32,269
necessary<font color="#CCCCCC"> security is you know has to be</font>

263
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:35,329
in a grove versus a dispensary and some

264
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:36,350
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are paying up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a million</font>

265
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,209
dollars in start-up costs just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

266
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:40,220
security alone so you have have to have

267
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,120
a ton of cash the way it is yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

268
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,709
promise if you don't have to if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

269
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:47,240
don't have the right backing you would

270
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,180
be on you stay in business exactly yeah

271
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,309
rikku something exactly yeah you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

272
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:53,899
you have to trick a suit or you're out

273
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:57,259
of the business basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's it</font>

00:09:57,259 --> 00:10:00,319
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> though yeah and just I just</font>

275
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,870
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um I mentioned a</font>

276
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,220
little bit but I think the place where

277
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,170
small you know mom and<font color="#E5E5E5"> pop grows are</font>

278
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,550
going to be is their kind of they're

279
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,110
going to become kind of the microbrews

280
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,389
that we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> in beer and you know they're</font>

281
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:13,220
really like fine wine industry I think

282
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's where mom pops are going to be</font>

283
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,829
because people are going to want like

284
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:18,139
Special Reserve marijuana the same way

285
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:19,730
they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> Special Reserve beer and wine</font>

286
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,500
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where we're going to</font>

287
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,769
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> them yeah yeah exactly those photos</font>

probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a better selection of</font>

293
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:38,059
other people want something specific and

294
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:39,980

Scottsdale Arizona hello what's

<font color="#E5E5E5">course what we'd problems can i solve</font>

317
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,610
for you sir um actually I was kind of

318
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:31,460
curious based on the you know increasing

319
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,680
investment you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the marijuana</font>

320
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,560
industry how long before companies like

321
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,850
Monsanto get involved in genetically

322
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,890
engineering and patenting you know

323
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,390
strains of marijuana for widespread

324
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,000
cultivation and sale yeah that's a good

325
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,580
question i mean to an extent<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is it's</font>

326
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">already happening you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have companies</font>

327
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,480
that have patented the strengths that

328
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,640
they have and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have been doing well</font>

329
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,870
and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of creating these</font>

330
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,640
consulting companies and they're going

331
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,380
to states that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are newly coming on the</font>

332
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,270
market and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of exporting knowledge</font>

333
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,680
and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so to a degree</font>

334
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,780
that's that's already happening but we

335
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,490
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have a monsanto of wheat or</font>

336
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,530
anything terrifying just<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet but yeah</font>

337
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,940
people already already patting what

338
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,680
they're up to and you know helping new

339
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,590
businesses yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome thank you hadn't</font>

340
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,630
kind of following<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with that then you</font>

341
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,060
mentioned terrifying and it is but at

342
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,340
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> arise on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> flip side would</font>

343
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know the potential interests from</font>

344
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,110
large companies like Monsanto be kind of

345
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,280
maybe perhaps good for the industry

346
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,840
maybe they could use their lobbying

347
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,670
efforts at the federal level to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

348
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,470
push forward like marijuana friendly

349
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:33,230
legislation and things like that yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

350
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that you know teaming up with big</font>

351
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,570
agriculture at the federal level or kind

352
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">of coming together I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

353
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,870
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to happen until marijuana</font>

354
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,670
becomes rescheduled until it becomes

355
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,520
federally legal so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't seen big AG</font>

356
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,140
reach out and say anything about

357
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,870
marijuana just<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet but I think that if</font>

358
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,670
they're going to kind of combine and

359
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,340
join forces there it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

360
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,780
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> marijuana is already federally legal</font>

361
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,640
well we saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean a lot of the growers</font>

362
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we met in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Canada and in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> States</font>

363
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,930
as well the head growers were often

364
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,610
people that used to manipulate tomatoes

365
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,290
and alfalfa and different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and</font>

366
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,870
then now there

367
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,790
marijuana so it's kind of cool you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

368
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,350
that the skills transfer over but the

369
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,060
two industries haven't really combine

370
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,940
just yet Asha<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that you just kind of</font>

371
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,380
mention it those<font color="#E5E5E5"> those couple guys that</font>

372
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,510
from like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Montana I think they grew</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

373
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,520
alpha and then they<font color="#E5E5E5"> switch to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> growing</font>

374
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,860
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pot you know as we've seen with</font>

375
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,050
corn and ethanol subsidies you know

376
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:29,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically giving economic incentive for</font>

377
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,880
farmers especially in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> large scale to</font>

378
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,490
divert more of their land to corn and

379
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,680
other you know cash crops if you will at

380
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,260
this point do you see in states where

381
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,360
you know growing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is legal that happening</font>

382
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,460
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a widespread level diverting a</font>

383
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,570
foreign land from other crops to

384
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">marijuana no I don't really see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

385
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening one because agriculture is</font>

386
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,740
having its own issues I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we're</font>

387
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about right now agriculture is</font>

388
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,589
having its own issues right now with the

389
00:13:53,589 --> 00:13:55,029
drought and having enough water for its

390
00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:57,520
own<font color="#CCCCCC"> resources so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're kind of</font>

391
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,380
locked in their own battle and but then

392
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,680
also most marijuana grows our indoor so

393
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,930
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily need to be you</font>

394
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,160
know in a place with certain amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

395
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,980
rainfall or things like that this can

396
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,210
really be grown anywhere with the right

397
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,560
technology so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't necessarily need</font>

398
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,990
any kind of land so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

399
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,459
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to divert it from agriculture to</font>

400
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:18,250
marijuana I don't and then finally um

401
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,339
you know we touched on big AG what about

402
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:23,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">like Big Pharma has have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you seen or</font>

403
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,610
heard anything in terms of them like

404
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,250
mobilizing to you know because there's

405
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,570
basically a prescription drug out there

406
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,560
that's out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their hands at this point</font>

407
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,230
so like Merck Pfizer Bayer have any of

408
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,180
them kind of is there been a<font color="#E5E5E5"> groundswell</font>

409
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,370
for them to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in market no</font>

410
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,140
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> again it's because marijuana is</font>

411
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">still scheduled one so the way it's</font>

412
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,470
scheduled it the federal<font color="#E5E5E5"> government says</font>

413
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,760
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't have any medicinal</font>

414
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,529
applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> whiff it gets rescheduled</font>

415
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:46,390
to schedule<font color="#CCCCCC"> too it'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go through testing</font>

416
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,029
go through FDA approval and then that is

417
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:50,950
maybe where you might see big firm we're

418
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,209
talking to them but at the same time

419
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:54,670
they probably won't and the reason is

420
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,980
because there's no patent for marijuana

421
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,510
right it's a plant it's already out

422
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,790
there the same way that there's um you

423
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,709
know Big Pharma probably won't profit

424
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:05,320
off of MDMA or LSD becomes legal for

425
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,330
drugs as a psychotherapy because the

426
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,410
patents already there so they can't

427
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">really make money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out of it in the same</font>

428
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,400
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they you know create vicodin in</font>

429
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,060
these other drugs so probably not<font color="#CCCCCC"> idono</font>

430
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,180
hey that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> two layers that's okay I hey</font>

431
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,710
listen I appreciate that's all I have

432
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:23,110
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks again awesome thanks so much</font>

433
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:26,440
yeah thanks Joseph<font color="#E5E5E5"> Michael hey what's up</font>

434
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,380
hi do we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some fun and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show</font>

435
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,390
the clip of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to alfalfa growers at</font>

436
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,710
the Cannabis Cup yeah I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess we</font>

437
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,090
could do that why don't we when we take

438
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:37,210
a look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at that cool after 40 years of</font>

439
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,010
cannabis commentary High<font color="#CCCCCC"> Times has</font>

440
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,300
stepped off the sidelines with a

441
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,010
multimillion-dollar growth fund to

442
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,660
invest directly in marijuana related

443
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,400
businesses these are the guys from

444
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,390
elemental seeds Tony<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Jason I</font>

445
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,800
discovered these guys dance guy did all

446
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,690
right in Montana there are a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

447
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,820
farmers wheat and alfalfa farmers in

448
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,280
Montana guys are master growers would

449
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,960
you want to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to farming alfalfa</font>

450
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,810
are you you<font color="#CCCCCC"> SAT with marijuana like that</font>

451
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,210
canvas<font color="#E5E5E5"> commit I think cannabis is it you</font>

452
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,380
know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean there's no medicinal</font>

453
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:11,650
benefits in yes I mean these guys were

454
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,810
obviously a lot happier in pot fields

455
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,670
and they were in alfalfa fields and as

456
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,290
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> the head grower at her ganna Graham</font>

457
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:20,020
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> moncton he also was a tomato grower</font>

458
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,240
and is now the head grower to organogram

459
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,100
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Canada so you see people transferring</font>

460
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,020
over and its people in these industries

461
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,630
that are like biotech and AG and are now

462
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,640
near marijuana so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was kind of cool to</font>

463
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,680
see so people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are happier growing pot</font>

464
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,390
than their alfalfa it's just a plant

465
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,800
Michael I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know to tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you it's</font>

466
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,630
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a plant I wonder why I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

467
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,550
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> strange to me but you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know we</font>

468
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,170
were just talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> big industry and</font>

469
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,430
we got this tweet that I want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

470
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a look at from a llamar de spouter</font>

471
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">I hope I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pronouncing that correctly</font>

472
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,180
and Lamar wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if prohibition</font>

473
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,010
is lifted do you think the tobacco

474
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,230
conglomerates will have a say in how

475
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:56,910
cannabis is regulated and distributed

476
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,950
huh I don't know that's a tough one I

477
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,890
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that marijuana might compete with</font>

478
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,950
tobacco I take a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of marijuana and</font>

479
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">tobacco users I think there's a little</font>

480
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,579
crossover in that Venn diagram of who

481
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:13,030
uses what but they might I mean if if

482
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,800
they can see a way to profit off of it I

483
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't see why not i mean money is money</font>

484
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,810
I mean money is money and money is green

485
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,420
Michael and so's marijuana and

486
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,410
Courtney's not green though and she

487
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,839
sends skype a seder so weird that way hi

488
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:30,430
Courtney hello thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me um</font>

489
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,500
my first question is related to kind of

490
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,720
the on-the-ground social consequences of

491
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,850
the change of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the law because I think</font>

492
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,070
it's interesting that you know here

493
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,750
numbers that so much money has been

494
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,190
pumped into the education system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

495
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">these positive things and so I wonder</font>

496
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">just from someone not in Colorado how</font>

497
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,820
the feel is actually on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ground is</font>

498
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,620
there pushback from people who are

499
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,990
conservative in Colorado or you know

500
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,210
what is the reason why more<font color="#CCCCCC"> coloradans</font>

501
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,710
aren't saying hey this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> working for us</font>

502
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,270
and let you know everybody should be

503
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing this yeah I mean the people that</font>

504
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,950
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked to you doesn't seem like there</font>

505
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,620
is a lot of opposition anymore and I

506
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,050
think that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing that you know</font>

507
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,790
all the all the taxation from the

508
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,860
marijuana industry and where the taxes

509
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,059
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to schools and other public</font>

510
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,520
entities so that's been great I don't

511
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,920
know why Colorado is more you know

512
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,520
liberal than than other states but it's

513
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,140
been cool to see people really getting

514
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">on board in that state yeah so kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

515
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:30,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">going along that that vein with the this</font>

516
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:33,200
idea of kind of like it being<font color="#E5E5E5"> a stigma I</font>

517
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,050
wonder if any of the dispensaries are

518
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,670
thinking about partnerships with I'm at

519
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">the top of my head I'm thinking like the</font>

520
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,360
NFL<font color="#E5E5E5"> or professional athletics because</font>

521
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,370
you know they've been traditionally been

522
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,750
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> the NFL pretty conservative</font>

523
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,700
about their their drug rules but they've

524
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,320
had pretty negative press recently so

525
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,480
you know just are they thinking

526
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,920
strategically about who they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

527
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,140
partnering with<font color="#E5E5E5"> whenever maybe the</font>

528
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,690
federal laws do change and because

529
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,100
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of money positively to be</font>

530
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,100
made yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it that stopped I mean</font>

531
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,800
we necessarily approach people with but

532
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,870
I'm sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are doing things that</font>

533
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,040
are off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> record and they don't want</font>

534
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">to tell us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who they're partnering with</font>

535
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:10,280
just yet but yeah definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

536
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,720
anything that's going to increase their

537
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,640
brand and visibility because you go to

538
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,440
you go to Denver and there's you know

539
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,270
more dispensaries in coffee shops so you

540
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,830
have to differentiate your your yourself

541
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">somehow so I'm sure they're they're</font>

542
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,950
gonna do that just so that they can kind

543
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">of elevate their brand yeah and along</font>

544
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,080
those lines do you see it becoming kind

545
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,120
of just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a traditional</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> American</font>

546
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,010
industry at any point when the laws do

547
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,840
change as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as like advertising goes</font>

548
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people see commercials and and</font>

549
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,050
things like that

550
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,910
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean yeah I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll probably</font>

551
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,280
be a traditional business if we can get

552
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,620
it rescheduled if we can change the tax

553
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,480
laws of access to baking I think it'll

554
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,430
function just like any other business

555
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,500
but I don't know I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> never actually</font>

556
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,600
thought about marijuana ads but I think

557
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,370
they would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

558
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">were definitely not run on prime time at</font>

559
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,060
all i think they would run like liquor

560
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,070
ads and other ads that only run with

561
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,620
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> brands for example but yeah it's</font>

562
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,330
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> its going to take a huge overhaul</font>

563
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,890
it's got to happen at the federal level

564
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,020
and state set like states like

565
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">California where it's this really</font>

566
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,740
confusing weird mess and<font color="#E5E5E5"> gray area of</font>

567
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,570
what you can do what you can't do that

568
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,250
needs to be sorted because until there's

569
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,350
a you know there's a black and white of

570
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's legal what's not investors aren't</font>

571
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,920
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to invest in anything</font>

572
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,280
directly in the plant totally yeah and

573
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,890
so you mentioned earlier to that unless

574
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,750
you have a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money to invest it's</font>

575
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">really hard to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into this so it the</font>

576
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,040
question in my mind is is there any

577
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,620
avenue for people who were selling on

578
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,240
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> black market before who may have</font>

579
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,850
like you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> untraditional expertise</font>

580
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,550
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved maybe as growers or</font>

581
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,570
things like that are those the people

582
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,870
who are doing those jobs yeah I mean as

583
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,780
long as you don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a record</font>

584
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,590
absolutely those people are doing those

585
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,780
jobs I mean when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to Andy</font>

586
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,150
Williams of medicine man his<font color="#E5E5E5"> brother was</font>

587
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,970
going weed in their basement and under

588
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,620
like the compassion<font color="#CCCCCC"> act where he could</font>

589
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,320
for you know so many people you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

590
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,880
under the medical laws but yeah those

591
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">people you know they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn</font>

592
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,960
somehow right and there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> always been a</font>

593
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,400
black market or like a weird<font color="#CCCCCC"> gray</font>

594
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,500
medical market so yes those people are

595
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,360
involved but again if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> had any</font>

596
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,090
kinds of charges on your record a lot of

597
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,700
the state regulations stipulate that you

598
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,200
can't get<font color="#CCCCCC"> involved if you have these</font>

599
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,300
possession charges so it makes it

600
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">difficult gotcha I don't think about</font>

601
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> makes sense I just have one</font>

602
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,190
more question it's about him when you

603
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">were down there did you come across any</font>

604
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,960
conversations about growing hemp kind of

605
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,510
in an industrialized way to replace you

606
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:39,500
know cotton or for textiles were you

607
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,330
know nutrition supplements or things

608
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,250
like that yeah that's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

609
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,110
heard a lot from the vendor so at the

610
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,240
Cannabis Cup it wasn't just a giant pot

611
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:47,850
party

612
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,650
it kind of was<font color="#CCCCCC"> but then there is also</font>

613
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,660
all these vendors and booths of

614
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,240
different people kind of promoting their

615
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,280
product and there were<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few hemp boots</font>

616
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,110
and people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talked to so yeah</font>

617
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,059
that's definitely a big market that we

618
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:04,650
might see cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you of cornice it's</font>

619
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,049
a cool documentary thanks i had 10 years

620
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:12,570
of research so is ready to go cool not
