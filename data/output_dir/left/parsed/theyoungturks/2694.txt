SO WE TOLD YOU HERE ON THE YOUNG
TURKS THAT THE TAX BILL WAS FOR
THE RICH AND FOR LARGE
CORPORATIONS.
84% OF THE BENEFITS WENT
TO THE TOP 4%.
BUT THE POWERFUL WHO GIVE
DONATIONS TO POLITICIANS.
LET'S MAKE IT DOUBLY CLEAR.
THEY TALK ABOUT THE CORRUPTION
BECAUSE THEY ARE PART OF THAT.
BUYING OTHERS SEE THE ADS WORK
FOR THE KOCH BROTHERS AND THE
MERCERS.
SO WHAT WILL THEY DO?
JUST TO THEIR CORRUPTION
OUT 
IN THE OPEN.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT IT.
IBTIMES REPORTS.
I LIKE HOW THEY
DIDN'T BOTHER WAITING.
I'M SORRY HERE IN AMERICA WE
HAVE LEGALIZED BRIBES SO NONE
OF THIS IS ILLEGAL.
THE KOCH BROTHERS CAN GIVEAS
MUCH AS THEY WANT.
BUT THIS THEY WANT TO RUB IN
YOUR FACE A LITTLE BIT.
WE ARE NOT ANYWHERE NEAR DONE
WITH THIS STORY.
LET'S GIVE YOU MORE DETAILS.
IN THE PAUL RYAN PACK ALSO GIVES
MONEY TO POLITICIANS AS WELL.
WHAT DO THE KOCH BROTHERS WANT?
THE TWO BROTHERS HAVE A COMBINED
$100 BILLION.
IF ALL THEY DID WAS RECEIVE 1% 単
ON CORPORATE TAXES ALONE IT
IS A GIANT SAVINGS.
THEN YOU HAVE YOUR INCOME TAX
AND THE PASS-THROUGHS.
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE
ESTATE TAX.
SO $500,000 TO BUY PAUL RYAN IS
LIKE NOTHING TO THEM.
THIS IS HOW THEY BUY ALL THE
POLITICIANS.
IT IS GROSS.
GET ALL THE MONEY OUT.
WOLF 単 PAC.COM.
NONPARTISAN, GET THE LEFT WING
YOUNG MONEY OUT, THE RIGHT
WING MONEY OUT, ALL OF IT.
IF WE ALLOW PRIVATE FINANCING
THEY WILL WORK FOR PRIVATE
INTERESTS.
DO PUBLIC FINANCING SO THEY WORK
FOR PUBLIC INTERESTS.
BROTHERS
ARE?
OIL AND GAS INVESTING.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT ONE OF THE MAIN
LINES OF WORK FOR THE KOCH THEY
ARE LAUGHING AT YOU.
WE ARE NOT DONE.
THERE'S A LOT MORE WHERE THAT
CAME FROM, ALL THE RICH
FAMILIES.
THE FIRST TIME THAT A
BILLIONAIRE OR CORPORATION GIVES
MONEY TO A POLITICIAN YOU CAN
STAY THEY COULD JUST TAKE
THEIR MONEY AND VOTE
THE 
OTHER WAY.
THE SECOND TIME IT CORPORATION
GIVES MONEY TO A POLITICIAN,
THAT MEANS THEY GOT A GOOD
RETURN ON INVESTMENT.
THAT MEANS THAT GUY IS NOW
WORKING FOR US.
GIVE HIM MORE MONEY SO HE GIVES
US BILLIONS IN RETURN.
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT
PAUL RYAN IS.
HE IS A PATHETIC ERRAND
BOY FOR THE RICH.
SORRY FOR THE TERRIBLE
PRONUNCIATION THERE.
SO THE BROTHERS AT LEAST WAITED
13 DAYS.
THE MEDIA NEVER REPORTS ON
THIS IN ITS ENTIRETY.
ALSO YOU TO 
THE MONEY AS IF IT
IS SOMETHING GOOD.
PAUL RYAN IS DOING TERRIBLY AND
GOT BRIBED $5 MILLION.
THE REPUBLICANS HAVE QUARTERED
THE MARKET ON THIS CORRUPTION.
TALK ABOUT A RIGGED SYSTEM 単 ONE
MORE LITTLE THING TO RUB IT IN.
HE SAYS UNDOUBTEDLY WITH A SMILE
ON HIS FACE, SMALL BUSINESS
OWNERS 単
KOCH INDUSTRIES IS THE LARGEST
PRIVATE INDUSTRY THERE IS.
CHARLES AND DAVID KOCH JUST TWO
PEOPLE HAVE $100 BILLION.
WHAT SMALL BUSINESS ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
LET'S GO TO THE PROPAGANDA REAL
QUICK.
THEY SPENT ALL THIS MONEY TO
EDUCATE THE MASSES.
BUT THEY CAN JUST RELY ON NOT
ONLY BUYING TELEVISION ADS BUT
THROUGH THOSE ADS GETTING THE
HOST TO SHUT UP.
THEY USED TO HAVE A LOCKDOWN
ON THAT STUFF AND THE USE TO
BE FRUSTRATED.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HATE THIS
BILL SO WHAT DO THEY NEED?
MORE EDUCATION IN OTHER WORDS
BRAINWASHING.
LOT OF TIME 
THEY 
TAKE THOSE
CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AND THEY
BUY MORE AND MORE ADS.
THEY KNOW THAT OVER 80% OF THE
BENEFITS ARE GOING TO THE TOP
1%.
THE 
REPUBLICANS HAVE THEIR BEST
INTEREST IN MIND.
THAT IS HOW THIS GAME IS PLAYED
AND THAT IS HOW THEY RIP ALL
OF US OFF.
