FOLLOW US AT NEXTREVFNC. HERE TO DISCUSS ALL OF THESE SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS TEZLYN FIGARO AND CHARLIE HURT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US INSTEAD OF BEING IN THE ELITE. I NEVER HAD A BETTER EXCUSE TO SKIP THE CORRESPONDENTS DINNER. WE'LL GET TO THAT. STEVE: A LOT HAPPENED THIS WEEK. LET'S START WITH THE SERIOUS STUFF. THE FOREIGN POLICY ASPECTS. THERE ARE THINGS WE SAW THIS WEEK CREE WEEK KREE WEEK KOREA HAS BEEN WIDELY COMMENTED ON. ALSO THE WAY HE MADE PROGRESS ON THE IRAN ISSUE WITH WHEN JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO THEY WERE SAYING HANG ON A SECOND. HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. THEY ARE COMING AROUND TO HIS POSITION. THEY CAN'T GIVE HIM CREDIT, CAN THEY. NO, I DON'T THINK THEY WILL GIVE HIM CREDIT. IT'S NOT THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF FELLOW HUMANS BUT THE NOBEL PRIZE COMMITTEE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE HIM A PRIZE. IT'S AMAZING. WE TALK ABOUT DOMESTICALLY WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS MEANT. AROUND THE WORLD, DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY. MAYBE IN SOME CASES DOING THING WORSE THEN THE WAY ESTABLISHMENT WAS DOING. IT'S A BREATHE OF FRESH AIR. WE HAD DECADES OF FAILURE BUT DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT IS THE FIRST STEP TO FINDING THE RIGHT SOLUTION. THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS HE SAID. I'M NOT GOING TO BE THE USUAL KIND OF THING PEOPLE GOT USED TO. HE WILL SHAKE THINGS UP AND DOING HIS WAY. ALL OF THE EXPERTS SAID IT WOULD BE A DISASTER. WRECK THE WORLD AND IT WILL BE A DANGER TO US. IT'S NOT TURNING OUT LIKE THAT. HIS PRECEPTIAL IS P.R. PRESIDENT TRUMP HASN'T CHANGED WHO HE IS. THE BIGGER THING IS PEOPLE DON'T EXPECT YOU TO BE THE SAME PERSON AND THINK YOU WILL DO IT. PEOPLE SAID HE WILL CHANGE WHEN HE GETS IN. HE WILL BE PRESIDENTIAL. WHEN YOU GET MARRIED IT'S NOT ABOUT ONCE WE GET MARRIED IT WILL BE DIFFERENT. HE IS WHO HE IS. PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT. THEY TALKED ABOUT AT THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT DINNER THIS IS WHO YOU WANTED AND PUT IN OFFICE. HE'S BEING CONSISTENT WITH THAT. I'LL ALSO SAY I'M SURE HE'S LISTENED TO SOME COUNCIL AROUND HIM. HIM NOT DOING FOREIGN POLICY BEFORE. WE CAN'T ASSUME HASN'T TAPPED INTO HIS RESOURCES. WHETHER IT'S GOOD OR BAD OR WHATEVER IT IS PEOPLE WILL REMAIN CRITICAL BECAUSE HE CONTINUES TO GO OUTSIDE OF THE BOX AND NOT DO WHAT WE ARE USED TO SEE A PRESIDENT DO. WHAT DOE YOU MAKE OF THE KANYE WEST THING, AGAIN WIDELY DISCUSSED THIS WEEK. WHAT WAS INTERESTING TO ME WHEN YOU SAW THE BACKLASH FROM THE LEFT HE WASN'T REALLY BLACK ANYMORE, HE WAS RICH. IT'S INTERESTING TO ME THE WAY THE RESPONSE CAME IN. THERE ARE TWO PROSPECTIVES. ONE I'M A POET AND HIP-HOP HEAD. I'M NOT SPEAKING FOR ALL AFRICAN-AMERICANS. YOU MADE A INTERESTING POINT ABOUT BEING RICH. HIP-HOP HAS A PROBLEM WITH PEOPLE BEING RICH. MOST OF YOU ARE MORE REPUBLICAN THEN YOU THINK. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT GETTING IRISH OR RIISH OR RICHH OR RICH OOR RICH ORR RICH OR ALREADY RICH. KANYE CAME FROM A POET AND TURNED INTO A RAPPER AND SPOKE ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS. ONCE YOU ARE DEEMED AS BAD FOR THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. I GET CRITICIZED FOR COMING ON FOX. IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE FOX HAS BEEN DEEMED EVERYTHING THAT'S HELPFUL MORE ME AND MY PEOPLE. FOR KANYE TO STEP OUTSIDE OF THAT AND SAY I WANT DO BE A FREE SPEAKER. I TELL PEOPLE ALL OF THE TIME SOMEONE HAS TO GO TO FOX. SOMEONE HAS TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION. BECAUSE HE CAME OUT AND DID SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND SAID LET'S HAVE THE CONVERSATION IS WHAT HIP-HOP AND AFRICAN-AMERICANS. HIP-HOP STARTED ABOUT TALKING ABOUT THE STRUGGLE. FOR HIM TO TALK ABOUT CAPITALISM AND FREE CAPITAL AND TALKING ABOUT SECOND AMENDMENT AND ALL OF THE THING HIP-HOP PREACHES ON A DAILY BASES. IF YOU TALK ABOUT TRUMP WHO IS ABOUT BUSINESS OWNERS. ROLLING IT OUT THAT WAY AS OPPOSED TO I'M WEARING A HAT AND MAKING IT A GIMMICK IS THE PROBLEM WITH WHY IT WON'T BE PRESERVED. STEVE: THAT'S A GREAT POINT. WE HAVE TO COME BACK TO THE AGENDA HE RAN ON AND WHETHER OR NOT HE'S DOING IT. IT'S INTERESTING WHAT HE WAS SAYING THERE. HE PICKED UP ON WHAT KASICH IS SAYING. THIS POLARIZATION AND ANGER. HE'S REACHING OUT AND TRYING TO GET OUT OF THE BOXES AND HAVE A CONVERSATION. THAT WAS THE STRANGE THING ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN. IF YOU HEAD THE MEDIA IT'S THE MOST POLARIZING CAMPAIGN. THERE WAS A LOT GOING ON. TWO THINGS DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN WAS THE MOST ISSUE ORIENTED CAMPAIGN I EVER COVERED. THAT GOES BACK A FEW YEARS. SECOND THING IS THE ISSUES AS YOU POINTED OUT WERE UNIFYING ISSUES. THEY SPOKE ABOUT BREAKING DOWN THE BUREAUCRATIC BARRIERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. ALL OF THAT, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT COLOR YOU ARE THESE ARE POPULAR MESSAGES. THE FINAL MESSAGE, YOU KNOW, ALL OF THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT BEEN GOOD TO ALL OF THE COMMUNITIES IT'S CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN GOOD TO. THAT'S THE MESSAGE THAT HE DELIVERED TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS. LOOK, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE WAS A PROFOUND MESSAGE. STEVE: WE COULD DEBATE ALL OF THAT FOR A LONG TIME. I KNOW THERE IS A RISK WE MAKE TOO MUCH OF IT. THERE IS SOMETHING INTERESTING HAPPENING HERE. THE WAY THE KANYE WEST
