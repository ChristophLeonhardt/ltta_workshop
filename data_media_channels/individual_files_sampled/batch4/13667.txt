as everyone knows it's very bad to engage in what about ISM what about ISM is when your enemy accuses you of doing something immoral and you respond by saying well what about that time you did something even worse this is very wrong for instance when the news media reports some scandal about Donald Trump and Russia I don't want to resort to what about ISM and point out that there's a double standard in the press geared toward hobbling Republicans and empowering Democrats so that only leftist policies will be put in place and the country will be transformed into a socialist monstrosity I'm not sure why I don't want to do that people keep saying I don't want to so I must not want it but who knows maybe I do want to try it find out the Washington Post broke the story yesterday that Donald Trump had a second secret meeting with Vladimir Putin during the g20 summit the meeting was also attended by several sinister communists including the sultry Russian spy xenia onatopp from the James Bond movies the ghost of Joseph Stalin and the editors of The Washington Post no I'm joking Trump and Putin sat at the same dinner table in front of a lot of other people but according to our friends on the left this proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Trump campaign colluded to help the Russians disturb our political process to a diabolical plot to make journalists hysterical over Russia stuff they never cared about before so let's do some what about ISM what about while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State her pseudo husband bill received half a million dollars for a speech he gave in Moscow and was paid by a company with ties to Russian intelligence what about the Clinton Foundation receiving something like a million and a half bucks from cronies and Vladimir Putin and that some of those payments may have been connected to Hillary Clinton's decision to sign off on a deal that transferred some twenty percent of our uranium into Putin's hands what about Hillary's campaign manager John Podesta failing to disclose his interest in Drule unlimited an energy company financed by the Kremlin and of course what about President Obama getting caught on a hot mic offering to weaken America's missile defense systems in places Putin wanted to intimidate and possibly conquer and what about the fact that Russia is financing many Democrats supported environmental groups whose purpose is to weaken American energy production so to protect Russian Petro dollars Putin's main source of income and what about the fact that after eight years of Obama appeasing Russia on every front President Trump has confronted Putin by freeing up our energy development and attacking Russia's allies in Syria now none of this is meant in any way to excuse any actions by Donald Trump or his associates because that would be what about ISM which is wrong I forget why I'm sure there's a reason and maybe not trigger warning I'm Andrew Klavan and this is the Andrew Clavin show

and type in clayvin oh good question this que la vie is in Victor aan that's stamped com enter Clavin you never got to go to the post office ever again so every time I talk about health care I get slammed I mean and it's always the same it's that same tone of voice you know you why do you compromise why don't you fight why are you giving in and all this stuff and on to me it's all about it's all that realism and politics it's all about what's really happening and how and whether or not you're being played because it think about this for a minute if you listen to an anti-trump er he's going to tell you the trumps to blame for the failure of the Republican health care bill if if you listen to a conservative he's going to tell you the moderates a lied to you all that time that they said they were going to repeal it they weren't really going to repeal it and of course if you listen to a moderate they tell you that the Conservatives are to blame for not compromising in order to win a fight I mean like put it this way let me put it to you in terms of my experience in life all right I've written novel that's mostly what most of my life but I've also written a lot of screenplays and for a period of time before my politics became known it was actually quite a successful screenwriter in the sense that I sold a lot of my screenplays although not a lot of them got made into films but that's that's how a lot of screenwriters make a living is to selling screenplays there are many differences between writing books and between writing screenplays but that's not the point the point is when you write a novel you are basically in complete control of what goes into that book you may get I've never had a really bad editor or just an editor who try to insist that something going to the book when an editor makes a suggestion you have the right to pull the book and take it somewhere else if you don't like it you have the right to just say no it's my name that goes on the book basically the editor is going to let you put into that book what you want so you can negotiate you can talk you can argue you can do whatever you want and most editors I like I said are really great almost all my editors have been really helpful and good and I'm happy to take suggestions and make the book better but I have the power I have the power and so I deal with that situation in a certain way when you weight a screenplay you have zero power you have no power whatsoever so if you're trying to keep your screenplay that's going to have your name on it from becoming a piece of garbage you really have to fight in a totally different way because they can fire you off your own project okay and a lot of people don't know this I write a screenplay at Batman was revenge and I send the screenplay in and they love it and they say it's great and they hire a director and I and he's director says I want to make Batman female and I go that's ridiculous they can fire me and keep my name on the screenplay and I you know I can pull it off the screenplay but I lose all the money that I would get from making the movie so you're in this situation where you have zero power and can be fired at any minute and anybody can change your script and any way they want especially the director you have to fight in a different way you have to make friends you have to get US allies you have to compromise you have to know when you can't win and give in you have to be ready to quit you have to be ready to resign I resigned from several films because I felt they were turning it into garbage and I didn't want to be the guy who did that job I didn't want to be the guy who made the script horse you just have to fight in a different way and my point about entitlements is that those of us who feel that entitlement SAP are free and we want there to be as few entitlements as are necessary to take care of only the poorest of the poor and everybody else should be given a hand up by their communities and by their churches and by the people nasa is safer we are in a tiny minority we are not the Republican Party we are the tail on the dog that is it you know and we can try as hard as we would like to wag that dog but we can't do it and you know let you know I was picking on Rand Paul yesterday I mean let's go over Rand Paul for just a minute okay Rand Paul has been the big voice of integrity you know we've promised to repeal why don't we repeal let's go back into the Wayback Machine for a minute six months ago right six months ago six months seven months January in January they the Senate had to pass certain budget regulations a budget resolution that would begin the repeal process okay every senator was for this because there was no political consequences at the time every senator was for except Rand Paul okay so this is the first let me get my Cutlass this is the first Rand Paul cut number three as a physician probably nobody is offended by or is against Obamacare more than myself I've seen it up close I've seen it firsthand I'll do anything to get rid of it however I don't want to have to vote for a budget that never balances and a budget that adds nine point seven trillion dollars in debt in order to get to it what I've told my colleagues is why don't we introduce a good budget one that balances write and then repeal Obamacare the way the rules of the Senate and the Congress are you cannot repeal it until you pass a budget why does it have to be a bad budget okay so the one senator he was not he was not for it he wasn't going to do what needed to be done to pass Obamacare because they passed repeal of Obamacare because the budget just wasn't good enough okay then three months ago they started talking about just repealing it and Rand Paul that was no good it had to be repealed and replaced here's the second cut this three months ago well actually I don't want to delay the repeal I'm all for the repeal as soon as we can get to it but we should vote on replacement the same day and I'm putting together a bill that will be out this week there will be a consensus replacement bill okay now they bring in peel and replace and it's just not good enough for Rand Paul this is right before the boat collapsed well you know what I've suggested to the president and I talked to the president again you know when he was in Paris just this last weekend or I guess on Friday and I've told him I think we can still you know if this comes to an impasse I think if the president come jumps into the fray and says look guys you promised to repeal it let's just repeal what we can agree to and then we can continue to try to fix replace or whatever afterwards so so it's never any good and every time he speaks as always I I won't repeal more than anybody else but you know and you know the old expression everything that comes before but is nonsense right I won't repeal but that there's never good enough and all I get is yes no you you attack Rand Paul but he's a man of principle he's a man of principle now here's Jonah Goldberg one of the smartest political observers out there in my opinion from National Review and he is no anti Rand Paul guy and he's always very reasonable about about Paul's positions he says I found many he asks the question is Paul really operating on principle here's what Jonah says I found many of Paul's arguments and complaints entirely persuasive on the merits but there have been times when I had to wonder if the merits were all that was driving him was just a coincidence that the bill was terribly unpopular in his home state of Kentucky where more than one in five Kentuckians are on Medicaid now that's the big cut that's the big reform everybody kept saying everybody who's for the bill kept saying this is the biggest reform basically in a quarter century if not more and reformers on Medicaid so one in five of his constituents are on Medicaid and Goldberg goes on this is the problem when touting your principles is a politically expedient way of avoiding accountability it's hard to tell whether principles or expedience are in the drive is in the driver's seat but it's not impossible to tell Paul learned politics on the knee of his father Ron Paul a longtime Texas congressman and irrepressible presidential candidate in the house the elder Paul earned the nickname doctor no because he voted against nearly everything on the grounds that it wasn't constitutional or Batarian enough but Ron Paul loved earmarks this is where you pick you put in stuff in a budget that's going to go right to your constituents of it you can brag about all you got for them he'd cram Ron Paul would crammed pork for his district into must-pass spending bills like an overstuffed burrito and then he would vote against the bill in the name of purity often boasting that he never approved an earmark or a spending bill so in other words he knew the bill at the past he'd stuff it full of earmarks and he'd vote against it because it had earmarks in it knowing it was so passed in 2006 Republicans proposed legislation to slow the growth of entitlements by 40 billion dollars over five years Democrats as usual screamed bloody murder about Republican heartlessness and voted against it so did Ron Paul on the grounds the reform didn't go far enough forty billion dollars cuts he votes against it because it didn't go far enough and Jonah adds man that sounds familiar now I can't say for sure this is Jonah again that Rand Paul is carrying on the family tradition he is different from his dad in many ways and yet every time health care proceedings moved one step in Paul's direction he seemed to move one step back senator Ted Cruz offered an amendment it would open up the market for more flexible and affordable plans like Paul wanted you no good Paul told fox's Chris Wallace those plans would still be in the context of the Obamacare mandates my idea always was to replace it with freedom legalize choice legalize inexpensive insurance allow people to join associations to buy their insurance Paul said which sounds good except a provision for exempting associations from Obamacare mandate was all ready in the bill what are you trying to get what can you get what that's those are the questions you've got to know you got to know what you can get and what you want to get and what the path is to getting what you can and if Ron Paul is always against everything he can bang his chest and say these four principles but essentially he is doing nothing now I know what you're thinking at this point you're thinking man this guy looks great I can barely concentrate on what he's saying because he's just so fit and the reason his workout how is that how is that for a segue hey work out conflicts here's the thing about working out okay when you're young you have this the reason you work out you want to look great you want you know the opposite sex to like you and all that stuff and

everybody wants to sell you something everybody wants to say is the other guy's fault everybody wants to sell you look we know the left sells virtue that's what they sell hey so you're a caring guy you're a nice guy just give me a little bit more power just give me just have a little less freedom and then you can go around and tell your friends yes I voted for that tax like yes I voted for that plan it doesn't matter it you know we on on the right keep saying look your cities are on fire you know black people are being murdered in Chicago and in Baltimore and before they're trying to have an on a murder free weekend and their slogan is donut you created don't anybody kill anybody it's like why didn't we think of this before are we going - just say no - blowing somebody else away and of course you know if a cop kills him I'm going to talk about that that Minneapolis story a little bit later but you know if a cop kills somebody then suddenly he's crucified so the cops don't want to police and they wonder why Democrat cities go up in flames but we know they sell you virtue on the right I keep telling you this they sell you outrage and anger why are you you betrayed this country yeah it was treason you promise this is probably all I want us to get stuff done that makes me more free that is what I want I am I am playing the game of Thrones and the throne to me is freedom I can't get all the freedom I want because I know freedom is a minority position even a lot of people who sit around and talk about freedom and where the maggots wave the flag they want those entitlements they want that help when it when things go wrong I want their government program that's what Bill Maher is saying that's we heard him yesterday saying it's already a socialist country that's nonsense but but there are socialist programs that people like and it's hard to take them away and that is true with health care Trump I think as we speak Trump is meeting with the Republicans he's meeting with the entire Republican Senate I don't know what they expect to come out the latest thing Trump has been saying is that he just is going to let Obamacare die and then the Democrats will come and help negotiate here is talking about that we've had a lot of victories but we haven't had a victory in health care we're disappointed I am very disappointed because again even as a civilian for seven years I've been hearing about health care and I've been hearing about repeal and replace and Obamacare is a total disaster some states had over 200% increase a 200% increase in their premiums and deductibles are through the roof it's an absolute disaster and I think you'll also agree that I've been saying for a long time let Obamacare fail and then everybody's going to have to come together and fix it and come up with a new plan and a plan that's really good for the people with much lower premiums not much lower cost and much better protection I've been saying that Mike as Nick you'll agree for a long time let Obamacare fail it'll be a lot easier and I think we're probably in that position where we'll just let Obamacare fail we're not going to own it I'm not going to own it I can tell you the Republicans are not going to own it will let Obamacare fail and then the Democrats are going to come to us and they're going to say how do we fix it how do we fix it or how do we come up with a new plan so you know I don't think the Democrats are going to give anybody hell I think they're just going to do everything they can to obstruct and by the way I don't actually blame Democrats for obstruction obstruction is what the opposition does the minority does in America is what you have to do it's a shame that we have lost largely through Obama largely through the work of Obama we have lost the ability to reach across the aisle at all and so it's so frozen that we need these big majorities to get anything done I definitely think mitch mcconnell's should throw out the filibuster because guess what guess who will throw out the filibuster the minute they have a majority so it might as well be us if it's going to be them is trump bearson blame yeah he does he does bear some blame and I don't say that just to point the finger at him I say it because of this Trump has really impressed me with his ability to learn stuff he I know he still goes off on Twitter sometimes he loses it and goes off but he does it less he does it less than he did and he's a little bit more circumspect I think the way he has treated foreign leaders has gotten better I think he is a guy who pays attention and learns what he's doing his weakest point obviously is hurting the Congress congressional cats toward legislation in order to do that I mean Barack Obama had this vision as I said yesterday had a vision of the socialist America he went out there to push it he made over 30 close to 40 speeches about Obamacare explaining to people how great it was if you want to keep your doctor you can keep your doctor he was lying through his teeth but he went out and he did it and Trump didn't and Trump as a guy who just kind of wants to put it he says basically I'm sitting here with a pen put something in front of me I'll sign it you know somebody ought to just give him a check and see if that's I met the opposition of course is playing this for all this worth I love I love the reaction to from Chuck Schumer we have the usual structure reaction here chuk chuk calm down here's Chuck Schumer in this in the Senate explaining this and careful you know single syllable words so his constituency can understand it what's wrong with letting Obamacare die in fact passing repeal and having it go into effect two years later is in many ways worse than the Republican health care bill that was just rejected by my Republican colleagues it's like if our health care system was a patient's who came in and needed some medicine the Republicans proposed surgery the operation was a failure now Republicans are proposing a second surgery that will surely kill the patient medicine is needed bipartisan medicine not a second surgery we urge our Republican colleagues to change their to passing repeal now is not a door to bipartisan solutions as the majority leader suggested this morning rather it is a disaster the door to bipartisanship is open right now not with repeal but with an effort to improve the existing system I love the logic of this they scrub you know health care before Obamacare had problems but it was basically working pretty well I mean it was working pretty well they made a crisis of it because they want to get that socialized health care in there so they can control your choices just like they're doing in Britain with baby guard they want to be able to decide who lives who dies who gets the health care who gets what you know what you have to do whether you can smoke all that stuff they want to be in your face they would like eat you to get up in the morning open the kitchen cabinet and a Democrat pops out and tells you how to live that is the whole point of doing this so they put this crap thing together this absolute piece of garbage together it's causing people suffering and they say and now and now the evil Republicans want to kill it killing it would be a mercy it would be a mercy to human beings the Cory Booker was even worse and this is this is just I play this only because it illustrates the the perfidy of the press why we need a better news media I mean that's not just cynical it's actually sinister here is a guy that promised consistently that he was hey only I can fix this that I'm picking on the guy that I'm going to make health care for everybody I'm going to get affordable oh it's going to be I think the word he used was terrific well he's completely abdicated that responsibility that completely broken that promise he outsource this health care process to people like Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan and didn't even try to reach out to one Democrat in the Senate nah we can call one Democrat didn't call us up to the White House to try to work with us a great deal maker failed to make a deal yeah and so now he's just saying that I'm going to imperil 30 million Americans if Obamacare fails it's not just people going to say hey policy doesn't just fail that means Americans will get hurt badly and you'll see very devastating things happen so that's not just a cynical way that's violating his promises that's sinister it is in and it's evil to plot against Americans like that it's evil to let their crummy program die cause they did this and only only at on CNN which is all the news media which is just representative all the news media guy get away with that without somebody saying two more wait you did this is your program they're just trying to fix it you know I just want to mention this briefly I always hate to talk about developing stories because it seems to be on a podcast there's no point you know you want to find out what the story is before you can talk about it but I do have to mention the story in Minneapolis really briefly and then we get to the mailbag where a Somali Muslim cop one of the few remember they had the schema flux of Somali Muslims where Obama was throwing them down anywhere he could get them going and he was tossing them into Minneapolis where there's already big where there's big Muslim community that's no no I'm sorry I'm sorry he was just putting them into Minneapolis st. Paul so now Mohammed nor became a cop two years ago he's called by this absolutely lovely Australian woman who was like a yoga teacher she was about to get married there's a video online of her rescuing little ducklings I mean she's just as absolute a nice person she called in a saying she was being harassed she came up to the car and Noor shot her through the car window across his partner she came up to his partner and shot and nor will not talk to investigators so we don't even know what his side of the story is I have to mention this because I want to see how it's played The Washington Post ran a huge story about this without mentioning the guy's name or that he was a Somali or that he was a Muslim so you can tell the bigotry of the left is completely inflamed I mean leftism is bigotry they regard everything is racial we had no idea whether any of that played into this we have no idea what this story is about do not listen to people saying you know this story doesn't hold together because we don't have enough of the story for it to hold together or not but it's going to be interesting I want to cover the way that it's covered as the truth comes out which the truth I believe ultimately will it's a very it's a it's a strange story so far but we know so little about it it's hard to know what it's all about the mailbag this is a beat there we have all right hi Andrew I often hear that people on the Left view human nature is being inherently good while people on the right view human nature's being inherently not good meaning capable of evil on their own in Genesis we read that God saw all that he had made including humanity and it was very good how then can Christian conservatives reconcile these two seemingly opposite understandings of humanity which seemed to be true thank you for all your hard work Levi I think he may have stopped reading Genesis before you got to the good part you know Christians believe that man is fallen that he dissipate God and went his own way in the garden and therefore he is a broken piece of godliness he is not evil he is not good he is flawed and fallen he is steeped in sin but still retains the mark of God on him so he still retains his mark of eternal goodness on him and he's capable of salvation through our old friend Jesus Christ you know it's a it's a fascinating I've said this before but Genesis the story of the Fallen Genesis is one most profound pieces of literature anywhere anywhere is such an incredible always all you arguing about whether it's literally true or a myth for me as as a myth it is actually more profound than if it had been literally true that you know if there were a guy named necessarily named Adam who necessarily talked to a serpent you know in his wife Eve talked to us up in an Eden Apple that is less interesting to me than what this story is saying because it's really really strange I mean the sin that they commit is that they eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and God says then he will be like us and it's obvious that he is somehow that they're somehow usurping God but why would God not want us to know what's good or what's evil the the theory that I work on at the at the moment is that you know the great revelation of almost any religious revelation anytime you have a religious revelation one of the things you realize is that everything is good everything is exactly as it is supposed to be that is one of the things that happens when people have mystic revelations that's the feeling they almost always describe and what I suspect is that if you can see the world from an eternal standpoint from God's standpoint it is very good if you live as we do in time where you can't imagine for instance how the suffering of a child can ever be redeemed we can't imagine how anything good could ever come from the suffering we see in the world because we have limited imaginations we don't have eternal imaginations we see things we see everything in time and there is no way that the suffering of a child of the Holocaust can be redeemed in time it can only be redeemed in eternity and we trust that in eternity all of the evil of the earth will be redeemed and it seems to me that what one of my theories is that that man had at some point the capacity or was made with the capacity to see the world in that way and then lost it because he decided to take on the power of judgment for himself and when Jesus comes one of the things he does is he keeps saying I'm the light of the world you can see things while I'm here that you won't be able to see later and what can you see you can see the disease goes away basically a word he wills it and it goes away you can see that the storms can be calmed you can see that the world is good it is actually a working good thing but only as we see it does it have good and evil in it and so I I really do believe that there's a form of vision that we lost and that is the nature of sin anyway that's the answer to why Christians can believe that people are not not inherently bad or inherently good they are inherently broken there's something wrong they have fallen and I think that that is literally true that is absolutely true Sean why do some people vote liberal but at conservative in their personal lives almost all of them almost all upper-class liberals are conservatives in their personal lives and this is what makes me feel you know you don't like to impugn want to impugn the motives of the opposition I just want to argue with their arguments but I do know so many liberals who just live they're faithful to their wives but they talk you know knowingly they make jokes about you know how how you know wild sexually they are in their minds basically you know it is a very strange thing charles murray calls it a the sociologist calls it a failure to preach what you practice and i think that it feels judgmental and pompous and unhip to say hey you know what i we do go to church you and we do stay faithful and we do have children in wedlock instead of out of wedlock and that helps us advance in life and it gives us a better life you know to say that is to put yourself up as a you know post yourself as a moral example which is uncomfortable makes you feel like maybe you're not a hip cool dude who's doing all the crazy things that the millennials are supposedly doing and probably not doing but they're doing in the newspapers and so I think that that's it I think there's a sense of virtue that you get from not from not displaying your good choices to other people and you've got to find a way around that because I think you're doing the disservice to the people who are destroying their lives because they haven't learned some of the stuff you have learned supreme overlord Clavin did God know that Adam and Eve another fall question but God know that Adam and Eve were going to eat from the tree of life the tree of the knowledge of good and evil stay sexy okay Jeff I will uh you know that's one of those questions I think that actually misunderstands how vastly different God's perspective is from ours you know I don't think God lives in time I think all things are simultaneous to God and even that I think as a metaphor that tries to way of trying from my limited mind to understand a mind that is so far beyond mine that I really can't understand it so the point of whether he knows something is going to happen but you know for instance I think that when I read the book of the Gospel of John I think that Jesus learns how distance he is from humans during the course of that gospel but if God always knows he they God the Father always knows because he has already lived through that time it doesn't at that time doesn't come to him it is always there so I think that he does he know he knows everything it was the whole deal but he doesn't he possibly doesn't see it in time the way we do so it's not a question it's all one great design to him that would be my my guess but of course you're talking about something you can't possibly imagine from Warren dear overlord Clavin of the high universe whose head shines like a thousand suns that's just a little uh keen I think I am a Christian and believe in the Bible if the Bible is truth what exactly happened to the dinosaurs why do all those fossils mean and why would God destroy a species we've created I wonder sometimes if these are from real Bible people you know the the question of the fossils is a question that was devised because somebody took all the generations in the Bible and strung them together and added the numbers together and decided that the world was like six thousand years old the world is millions of years old there's been things have evolved species have come and gone and the dinosaurs seem to have been one of them you know they seem to they were remember the dinosaurs were before the development of the larger mammals probably because the mammals were hiding under rocks going dinosaurs out there you know and it was only when the dinosaurs died possibly one Theory's because of a meteor strike that when the dinosaurs died they that was when the mammals came out and we could could develop there's nothing to me there's nothing in the Bible that says there can't be dinosaurs I mean I that adding up the generations that happen to be listed in the Bible is just not a very secure way of dating the earth I think there are better ways of taking the earth than that all right dear mr. Clavin I've been in denial for years but I can deny it no longer I'm going bald please help me ha ha ha I give although I need you to tell me how you overcame the inner struggle with self and body image so I can be as strong as you and all my hair is gone sincerely ben is that Shapiro writing for me uh no um she T that you know that's an interesting question a it didn't wait the thing that bothered me when I was going bald was that it was really hard it was before it was before people really started shaving their heads so I would go to the barber and I said whatever you do don't give me his comb comb over because I didn't want to be fake I thought I'm losing my hair I can live with that and they would do it anyway and you couldn't get him not to do it I mean that is why I started clipping my own air I finally took a buzzer and busted down so low and then I would just go to the barber every week or so and just ask him to buzz it over again and finally I worked up the courage to just do it all myself you know my brother always told me that every man gets a certain amount of testosterone and some wasted growing hair I feel like this is a power thing you know look all I can tell you is the only reason you know I always remember that when Rogaine came out you know Rogaine was supposed to make your hair grow back and they said one of the side effects was that it made you impotent and I thought if you're into dude why do you care the only reason if you really care about the way you look is because you want women to like you try liking them you know that will really go that'll really go far because women actually don't care so much about whether you have air or not they just care whether you're nice and actually like them as who they actually are as opposed to who they're supposed to be you know live with the dude I mean these are the vagaries of life one day one day hopefully long long long in the future you're going to look in the mirror and think oh there's a genetic one I mean heck I'm dying things really bad things happen losing your hair is no really one of them it really isn't I mean it's it's not it's not something you want to worry about too much I don't know if I can help you with that I mean that's something you're gonna have to learn from yourself today is a big day for me I have to say today is a big day for me because I ordered some wine from wink and it hasn't arrived yet so I'm not going to plug the line to how good it is but the thing about wink is wink is not only an online wine club they are actually wine manufacturers and I look I'm a big wine Victor I mean I I love wine obviously you know at the end of the day I like to have a scotch I like to have a whiskey but with food wine just makes everything taste better it's lighter than whiskey you can't drink a lot of whiskey or will you know you can't you shouldn't drink a lot of wine either but you can drink a little bit more because it has less alcohol is less poisonous it really it makes everything better it makes life itself better I mean it's in the Bible remember Jesus drinks wine in the bottle he turns water to wine and and it's this this Club what they do is they give you a questionnaire so questionnaire so you know so they know what kind of taste you have and what you like and then they start sending you wine and making suggestions and they even have suggestions for recipes to go with the wine one of my favorite scenes in all movies is is James Bond and From Russia With Love he I think it's Robert Shaw he realized he's a Russian spy because he orders red wine with fish so like he beats them up busy I ordered wine with red wine with fish people get very nervous about not knowing which wine to drink with what and you can learn that from belonging to winking because they will send you meals to go with the wine and you can taste and see why these wines go together so you're not only getting good wine you're actually learning stuff and they make the wine themselves so they have all kinds of they go all over the world get the grapes make the lines themselves so you're going to taste wine you've probably never tried before really expand your knowledge while drinking wine which is the best way to expand your knowledge right now wink is offering listeners 20 bucks off your first order when you go to try wink calm slash Andrew let me repeat that it's t ry WI mc.com it's not W I call it wink but it's winc just T ry WI MC come / Andrew you get $20 off your first order now plus complimentary shipping try wink calm try wink calm / Andrew and bye - the next time we have that add-on I will have tried the wine and will be able to tell you if it's good or not and I will stuff I like politically incorrect masterpieces we've been doing and this is one you may not know because it's so old or if you do know what you do know it from a terrible terrible remake with Madonna in 1974 Lena Wert Muller a radical filmmaker where she was a feminist I think she was an anarchist it was probably a communist as all this stuff she made a film called swept away was called swept away by an unusual destiny in the blue sea of August and they brought it out in America swept away because they didn't think that Americans would pay attention to put Giancarlo Giannini one of the great comic actors and mariangela melato and the story is basically this a rich woman on a yacht trip who is kind of snobby and abusive to the hands on the ship gets shipwrecked with one of the hands on the ship and they are lost on this island and so they are from going from a rich lady to a working-class guy they suddenly just become man and woman in the very in the most basic sense while the feminists flipped out but the thing about it is is you I wanted to point this out it reminds me of German all German all is a novel by Emile Zola who about a coal strike an email Zola claimed to be a socialist but he also was a great great novelist so he told the truth and if you read German all which is a terrific book by the way really just an entertaining read you will see this is the most anti socialist it really shows you exactly what socialism does to people and in this it's not you know the feminists went nuts because as they're reduced to just a man and a woman of course the man becomes the more powerful over the woman and all this and the woman shows a desire to have a powerful man in her life in very very graphic and an entertaining and sometimes shocking ways but the this movie is much more complicated than that and the ending is genuinely genuinely moving and kind of shocking and says a lot about men and women it is politically correct it's in Italian I'm not going to play why brought in a dubbed version but it's too silly the dubbing makes it just seem silly it's the original Italian is really fun it is funny and it says more you will learn more about men and women watching this movie than you ever will from listening to a leftist because you'll learn nothing that way except timeout left ISM all right one more day in the Clavin week oh and tomorrow we have Roger Kimball you know we cancelled Roger Kimball last time because of all the technical glitches we're having but we will have him on one of the most brilliant men in the country runs you know magazines and publishing houses and well and yet and yet a very highly educated guy so highly educated he sometimes wears a bowtie that's how advocated he is I know yeah you got to be educated but a big big trump supporter so we're going to talk to him about that and where he thinks the culture is going be there I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show and we'll see you again tomorrow
