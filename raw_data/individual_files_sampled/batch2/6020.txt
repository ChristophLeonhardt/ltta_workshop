an FBI agent is being investigated by authorities in Denver following an incident where he accidentally discharged his weapon now this all took place at the mile high spirits bar in Denver he was off duty at the time the video that you're about to watch is kind of amazing but with that said take a look so that is all right he's having fun pretty good actually gun Falls Oh No yeah so he does the flip and the gun Falls as he does the flip and then when he attempts to pick it up he accidentally fires the gun one person was struck in the lower leg but is expected to survive local authorities are looking into this case because they want to determine whether or not charges should be filed against him so far no charges have been filed and they're specifically looking into whether or not he was drunk at the time of the incident I mean he's at a bar just what but why why did you have the gun and you're they just do the back flip with the gun in a different place like in a safe secure place not in your pants instead of got in your pants are you happy to see me all right so look the whole story was super fun there at a place called mile-high spirits and their spirits were a mile high he was not on duty so I don't have any problem with him drinking he's at a bar and admittedly those moves were pretty good they were very good yeah I don't have that at me okay so bless his heart on that see me dancing at your wedding yeah I did that's why okay this is the stuff I have to deal with it all right anyway so but this is why we tell you guns do kill people now thank God it only hit her in the leg and there's a second story lesson in this story but he's not a bad guy I mean as far as we can tell other than being reckless with a gun which is bad right and there should be definitely be consequences for that accountability for that but it's not always a bad guy who shoots you right oftentimes it's an accident in fact if that happens over 500 times every year it actually happens way more that it happens thousands upon thousands of times 500 times somebody dies through accidental shootings yeah that's why I know everybody loves to keep their guns everywhere and I'm gonna be safe well when you're doing a back flip at Mile High spirits you're not safe and and so by the way the second story sorry second moralists Ariana is that it's never the first problem it's like people always get themselves in bigger trouble when they respond poorly to something they did wrong right it's okay just take a moment like you what you did wrong was you had the gun on you and when you did the bank flip it came out don't panic he patted you over to pick it up and that's when it fires yeah it didn't fire when it landed fired when he picked it up yeah and and the one thing that I want to kind of point to is that when it comes to those who lawfully purchase their guns they're good people they're not trying to cause any problems I think the biggest issue is the frame of mind that we have in the country where we treat guns as if they're harmless objects right and so that whole phrase of guns don't kill people people kill people I think that that kind of messaging just lets makes people think hey this is just a gun I don't need to take precautions to make sure that this weapon is secure or secured so I don't accidentally shoot someone you know it didn't cross his mind because we have this ridiculous like I don't know nonsensical cavalier attitude yes cavalier is a perfect word for it and so think about it this way so guns are designed to kill things including people so are other things for example a hand grenade now have you ever heard anybody say hand grenades don't kill people people kill people no cuz the whole point of a hand grenade is you throw it in you kill people it would be a lot more careful with a hand grenade right that's exactly where I was going with it if you had a hand grenade in your pocket you would not do a back flip okay you wouldn't you probably be panicky right yeah your back black dude you'd be very very careful and you should be just as careful with a gun because it is actually easier to go you have to actually take the pin out in a hand grenade you see there in the gun all he was doing was picking it up and then boom it went off but we because of the propaganda of the NRA and the gun manufacturers think about guns are no big deal no big deal no they're a big deal they're a killing machine that is what they are designed to do so be incredibly careful with them and finally Trump saw this was like what did I tell you about the FBI as far as we know he has nothing to do with the special counsel okay but probably will be used as propaganda yeah they'll turn it around they'll do a back flip on it and I like the CNN described him as doing a torrent of dance fair enough yes tip of the hat to CNN on that one two easy ways follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber
