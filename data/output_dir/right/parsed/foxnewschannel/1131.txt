ARE WORKING HARD TRYING TO
PROVIDE YOU GOOD INFORMATION
AND TRYING TO PROVIDE THAT
SAME GOOD INFORMATION TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
>> Harris: YOU KNOW,
SPEAKER, THERE HAS BEEN TALK
RECENTLY ABOUT WHETHER WE EVEN
NEED WHITE HOUSE PRESS
BRIEFINGS EVERY DAY.
THAT MAYBE SOME OF THEM SHOULD
BE IN AN OFFICE AND NOT ALL
TELEVISED BECAUSE IT LOOKS
LIKE SOME OF THE REPORTERS
MIGHT BE DOING GRANDSTANDING.
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE THAT.
>> Newt: LOOK, I ADVOCATED
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE
ADMINISTRATION THAT THEY GET
RID OF THE WHOLE THING.
>> Harris: REALLY?
NOT EVEN OFF THE RECORD?
I WAS DRIPPING WITH SARCASM
WHEN I SAID I COULDN'T IMAGINE
IT.
>> Newt: HERE IS WHAT I MEAN
TO GET RID OF THE WHOLE THING.
YOU HAVE A RELATIVELY SMALL
NUMBER OF REPORTERS WHO ARE
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY ARE IN
THE WHITE HOUSE.
THEY ARE PRESSURE.
THEY SIT AROUND AND TALK TO
EACH OTHER ALL DAY.
DEEP DOWN THEY RESENT THE FACT
THAT THEY ARE VOYEURS.
THEY ARE AT THE BECKON CALL OF
THE PRESIDENT.
>> Harris: HAS IT ALWAYS
EXISTED OR JUST NOW?
>> Newt: EXISTED SINCE AT
LEAST KENNEDY.
THE RISE OF TELEVISION.
MY POINT IS JUST THERE ARE A
THOUSAND WAYS TO COMMUNICATE
WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
YOU DON'T OWE THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE HAVING 50 OR 60 -- YOU
HAVE THREE OR FOUR CLOWNS WHO
INSIST ON GETTING IN FIGHTS
WITH HER.
AND THEY ARE ONLY IMPORTANT
BECAUSE THEY GET IN FIGHTS
WITH HER.
>> Harris: CLICK BAIT ON
SOCIAL MEDIA BECAUSE THEY CAN
CLIP THAT PIECE OF VIDEO AND
IT'S CLICK BAIT.
LOOK, IF ANYBODY DOESN'T THINK
THAT IS HAPPENING CHECK OUT
THE TWITTER FEEDS.
>> Kennedy: I UNDERSTAND
THAT EVERY POLITICIAN WANTS TO
GET THEIR SIDE OF THE STORY
OUT.
THAT IS A NATURAL INCLINATION.
I ROLLED MY EYES WHEN HILLARY
CLINTON DID IT.
I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY
HERE TO HAVE A WEBSITE FOR
THAT.
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN VERY
ADEPT AT USING TWITTER FOR
THAT.
HE HAS OVER 50 MILLION TWITTER
FOLLOWERS AND HE DIRECTS THE
MEDIA WHERE HE WANTS THEM TO
GO.
I LIKE THE EXCHANGES.
I LIKE ANY SORT OF AN OPEN
FORUM WHERE THE IDEA CAN GET
OUT.
I ALSO LIKE -- I THINK SARAH
SANDERS DOES A VERY GOOD JOB
AT KEEPING THINGS TIGHT AND
SWATTING PEOPLE DOWN.
SHE HAS GOT AN INCREDIBLY
DIFFICULT JOB AND IT IS EASY
FOR PEOPLE IN THE ROOM TO GANG
UP ON HER.
HER COMPORTMENT IS BETTER THAN
SOME OF PEOPLE WHO PRECEDED
HER.
NOT JUST IN THIS
ADMINISTRATION BUT OTHERS.
>> Abby: THE REASON SHE IS
THERE THAT LONG SPEAKS TO HOW
GOOD SHE HAS BEEN.
THE REPORTERS HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO ASK ABOUT CERTAIN QUESTIONS
LIKE THE DON JUNIOR MEETING.
WHY WERE THEY DISHONEST FROM
THE BEGINNING?
I THINK THE CHECKS AND THE
BALANCES IS AN IMPORTANT
THING.
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE
GOING ON AND YOU MAKE THAT
POINT, SPEAKER.
THEY ARE IN SUCH A RUSH TO
FIND THE NEGATIVE THAT THE
PRESIDENT IS DOING.
THE PERFECT EXAMPLE IS APRIL
RYAN YESTERDAY.
THEY THREW THIS BIRTHDAY BASH
WHEN THE EAGLES, WHEN HE
DISINVITED THEM FROM THE WHITE
HOUSE ON THE SOUTH LAWN.
SHE TWEETED OUT THERE WERE A
BUNCH OF BOOS TO THE PRESIDENT
AND SHE HAD TO DELETE THE
TWEET BECAUSE IT WASN'T
ACCURATE.
BUT THE MOMENT THAT THE TWEET
WAS UP THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF
RETWEETS BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT
TO BELIEVE THE NARRATIVE.
THEY WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING
