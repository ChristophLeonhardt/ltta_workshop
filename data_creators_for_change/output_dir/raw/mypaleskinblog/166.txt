my<font color="#E5E5E5"> acne videos on their channels I</font>

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,710
actually almost squealed with excitement

31
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,590
when I saw her lashes in superdrug here

32
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,590
in the UK and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I picked up two different</font>

33
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,470
types of lashes I got the shining star

34
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,890
lashes and I also got the<font color="#E5E5E5"> grand glamour</font>

35
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,070
lashes they honestly look like really

36
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,210
expensive boutique and like mink style

37
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,420
lashes they are so beautiful and they

38
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,040
don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of horrible um you</font>

39
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,360
know when you see lashes and they have

40
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,450
that really machines type edge and they

41
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,579
just they just don't appeal to me

42
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:00,299
whereas these are so soft and so sultry

43
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,750
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I just love them let's move on</font>

44
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,299
to lipstick add my favorite lipstick i

45
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,628
have this month is the maybelline color

46
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:12,060
sensational lipstick and this is in

47
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,350
shade 84

48
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,210
to probably should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> cleaned that</font>

49
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,670
before I started filming this video and

50
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,080
this is the lipstick that I'm wearing

51
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I absolutely love this I don't</font>

52
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,010
know why I love it so much um I just

53
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's such a beautiful color and</font>

54
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,710
it's very much a sort of my lips but

55
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,140
better color it's that kind of topi pink

56
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,420
shade but because it's one of the pearl

57
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,060
ones it does have that really nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sheen</font>

58
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,120
and it's got a slightly glossy finish to

59
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,090
it so I definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> love this as much as</font>

60
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,310
I would love to fill a favorites video

61
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,740
with about 10 different foundations on

62
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,780

76
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,390

90
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:05,070
contains rose water and<font color="#E5E5E5"> green tea so I</font>

91
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,010
spray this on my face when I'm done and

92
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,630
it has a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my mouth</font>

93
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:15,930
it's got a really nice kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of um gentle</font>

94
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,329
application to it it applies really

95
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,940
evenly and you can use this kind of like

96
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,340
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> smashbox primer I guess so you can</font>

97
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,310
use it before makeup and to extend your

98
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,070
makeup where

99
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,380
and you can also<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it after makeup to</font>

100
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,050
set your makeup now I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> used it</font>

101
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,840
before makeup yet but I do notice a

102
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,300
difference when I use it after I apply

103
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,430
my makeup so the makeup I'm wearing

104
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,970
today it is now x it it's now quarter

105
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,130
past 9 i'm filming this<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the evening</font>

106
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,380
it's quarter past nine and i have had

107
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">this makeup on since two o'clock let's</font>

108
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,610
see how bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is yeah it's doing good</font>

109
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,380
I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> this makeup on since two</font>

110
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,300
o'clock possibly earlier actually since

111
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,060
one o'clock so that's eight hours we're

112
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,850
on this makeup and this is the same

113
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,530
makeup that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wearing in my flawless</font>

114
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,870
foundation video by the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will leave</font>

115
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:12,250
the link here and yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i set this using</font>

116
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,310
the pixie spray and it is definitely

117
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:18,040
definitely prolonged the makeup usage

118
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,900
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this might be quite</font>

119
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,730
expensive i'll leave the price on the

120
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,370
screen<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you can make a judgment for</font>

121
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,560
yourself with fits in your budget or not

122
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,600
I just definitely notice a difference

123
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,540
when I'm wearing it so definite new

124
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,810
favorite I have one more favorite this

125
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,510
month<font color="#E5E5E5"> for makeup and that is not</font>

126
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,790
actually a makeup product but it's a

127
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,780
storage product and this is the Z power

128
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,020
Z palette<font color="#E5E5E5"> I call it said I want to call</font>

129
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,600
it sides because I'm British I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

130
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,200
it's probably pronounce zi pilot<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

131
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,630
would totally just showed myself up

132
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,640
challenger in American accent hematite Z

133
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,780
palette like oh my god Z palette no I

134
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,550
just sound British with a weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> accent</font>

135
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,130
and I do that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a palette that</font>

136
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:09,130
I picked up from<font color="#CCCCCC"> imats here in London</font>

137
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:13,090
and I love<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so I've had a couple of</font>

138
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">these individual anastacio</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I shadow pans</font>

139
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,270
for quite a while but I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever had</font>

140
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,460
a case to put them in and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font>

141
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,920
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Z palette palette pro I think it</font>

142
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,960
might just<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the medium one or the</font>

143
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,910
large one I can't remember it's all

144
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:33,130
magnetic here on the black<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it has</font>

145
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,440
little magnetic<font color="#CCCCCC"> clothes as well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

146
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,120
they're not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come out and</font>

147
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,380
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not going to fall</font>

148
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,550
everywhere and it just

149
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,650
definitely keeps things Nita if you know

150
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,650
any kind of like reasonably priced or

151
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">fairly cheap I shadows there are</font>

152
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">individual pans then let me know about</font>

153
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">those as well because I want to keep</font>

154
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,690
things as cost effective as possible so

155
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,940
everybody can try and do the tutorials

156
