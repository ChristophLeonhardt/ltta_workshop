BUT THEN AGAIN, HE IS THE

00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:23,521
ONLY PERSON WHO NEEDS TO.

00:04:23,521 --> 00:04:24,671

IS HE GOING TO STAY THERE?

203
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,976

204
00:04:28,976 --> 00:04:30,077

AND NOW THEY ARE WRESTLING

212
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,837
WITH THIS IDEA OF COULD HE

NONE OF IT WAS TRUE AND IT

219
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,297
WASN'T TRUE, WHY SHOULD THAT

220
00:04:48,297 --> 00:04:50,198
PREVENT HIM FROM GOING BACK.

221
00:04:50,198 --> 00:04:51,749
BUT, AT THIS POINT, NOBODY
