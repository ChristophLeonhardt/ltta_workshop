Russian military says only two children have managed to escape the besieged Syrian district of Eastern gutten on Tuesday Russia established a humanitarian corridor to help civilians find safe passage out of the region yeah warning these are the upsetting images of the moment Syrian soldiers saved the two children they were clearly in shock and were comforted after reaching the government health position the children say they left Goethe with their parents let's put what's happening in context on our news wall here eastern Goethe is located just outside the Syrian capital of Damascus it's been occupied by various rebel and Islamist groups for years and been under siege since 2013 and here just to the north of Goethe just outside the humanitarian corridor this UN refugee camp within and there's a special shelter for those fleeing Eastern Goethe facilities that have been prepared for refugees the center offers food supplies as well as medical assistance with many humanitarian groups volunteering there such as the Red Crescent my colleague Nadira Tudor spoke to a Syrian monasteries Mother Superior is working at the camp until today this corridor hasn't been successful I regret to say it because there is a will in the rebel side to keep the civilian under their custody and maybe to use them as a human shield going from a lota out from a lota to the camp is very dangerous it is people are shelled and they are sniped and we have witnessed this our team was there in contact with families inside al-huda wanting to go out and being insured by our side and of course the Red Crescent so they had to wait the whole day and it was impossible for those families to go out because they were sniped I'm imagining that those trapped within the city are completely helpless and we can't imagine the kind of living conditions as well because of lack of supplies and I know that inside Goethe there is no food there is sometimes no water and those people they want to live because they are living extreme conditions I have on my phone many requests from people inside the hotel to be helped to go out safely because inside it's also very difficult for them can you describe how those people the messages that you're getting personal messages on your phone can you describe the kind of things that they're saying to you I am getting private messages and you know the woman are never safe there everybody can you expand on that why violence sexual violence every time we have had to deal with new vacua turtle we have found like 25% of the woman and little little girls they have they have been assaulted and they have had sexual violence it is a very sad reality can you tell us who the perpetrators are of that sexual violence the people in control the armed men that are in control and they can oblige they can make pressure it looks pretty bleak doesn't it for the people trapped inside it's very bleak what is the solution I mean the solution is that the international community beginning with the UN United Nations to really state and to ask the rebels to really protect the corridor not to shell the corridor and not to make pressure on the people wanting to live to prevent them from living this must be done by people that are decision-makers
