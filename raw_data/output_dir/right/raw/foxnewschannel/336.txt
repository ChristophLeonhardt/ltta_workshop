1
00:00:06,053 --> 00:00:07,387
WELCOME BACK, WE KNOW

2
00:00:07,388 --> 00:00:08,187
DEMOCRATS ARE ENRAGED ABOUT

3
00:00:08,188 --> 00:00:10,590
THE 2016 ELECTION IN THE

4
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:11,991
KAVANAUGH AFFIRMATION.

5
00:00:11,992 --> 00:00:13,226
CHRIS MATTHEWS SUMS UP THE

6
00:00:13,227 --> 00:00:13,526
MOOD.

7
00:00:13,527 --> 00:00:19,565
HE NICELY.

8
00:00:19,566 --> 00:00:20,266
>> THE BASE WILL ATTACK THE

9
00:00:20,267 --> 00:00:21,034
LEADERSHIP IF THEY ALLOW IT TO

10
00:00:21,035 --> 00:00:21,668
HAPPEN, AND THEY SHOULD

11
00:00:21,669 --> 00:00:24,604
BECAUSE THIS IS TIME FOR

12
00:00:24,605 --> 00:00:25,405
VENGEANCE ON WHAT HAPPENED TWO

13
00:00:25,406 --> 00:00:25,838
YEARS AGO.

14
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,409
>> YES INDEED.

15
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,510
NOWHERE DOES IT SAY IT HAS TO

16
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:31,644
BE MADE UP OF NINE JUSTICES,

17
00:00:31,645 --> 00:00:32,946
NOT IN ANY AMENDMENT.

18
00:00:32,947 --> 00:00:39,852
THAT MAKES THE IDEA POSSIBLE.

19
00:00:39,853 --> 00:00:40,620
IT MEANS ADDING EXTRA JUDGES

20
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:48,861
TO THE HIGH COURT TO ADD A NEW

21
00:00:48,862 --> 00:00:49,429
IDEOLOGICAL MAJORITY.

22
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,096
IT GOES ALONG WITH ALL THE

23
00:00:50,097 --> 00:00:50,763
OTHER IDEAS TO CHANGE THE

24
00:00:50,764 --> 00:00:52,332
RULES OF THE GAME WHEN THERE

25
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,099
LOSING AND REDUCING THE NUMBER

26
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,801
OF RED STATE SENATORS BUT

27
00:00:54,802 --> 00:00:55,668
BELIEVE ME, COURT PACKING WILL

28
00:00:55,669 --> 00:00:58,371
BE A MAINSTREAM IDEA ON THE

29
00:00:58,372 --> 00:00:59,539
LEFT.

30
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:07,847
IN FACT, MICHAEL EVAN ODDI.

31
00:01:07,848 --> 00:01:08,848
[INAUDIBLE]

32
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:13,152
HE IS OFF AUTHOR OF ITS TIME

33
00:01:13,153 --> 00:01:14,887
TO FIGHT DIRTY, HOW THEY CAN

34
00:01:14,888 --> 00:01:20,026
BUILD A LASTING IMPACT IN

35
00:01:20,027 --> 00:01:20,360
AMERICA.

36
00:01:20,361 --> 00:01:21,094
YOU'VE MADE THIS ARGUMENT YOU

37
00:01:21,095 --> 00:01:22,362
WANT THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT

38
00:01:22,363 --> 00:01:26,632
AS YOU HOPE IT WILL BE IN

39
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:27,567
2020, YOU WOULD BE ALL RIGHT

40
00:01:27,568 --> 00:01:32,405
WITH A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT IN

41
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:33,373
2024 OR 2028, BOOSTING UP TO

42
00:01:33,374 --> 00:01:34,207
13, YOU'D BE OKAY WITH THAT,

43
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:34,574
RIGHT.

44
00:01:34,575 --> 00:01:36,609
>> ONE THING I WANT TO SAY, I

45
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:38,311
SAID THIS AND EVERYTHING I'VE

46
00:01:38,312 --> 00:01:41,347
WRITTEN ABOUT THE SUBJECT,

47
00:01:41,348 --> 00:01:42,448
WHAT I REALLY WANT AND WHAT I

48
00:01:42,449 --> 00:01:43,182
REALLY PREFER AND HATE TO

49
00:01:43,183 --> 00:01:43,750
DISAPPOINT YOU IS A

50
00:01:43,751 --> 00:01:44,150
COMPROMISE.

51
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:44,951
A COMPROMISE WOULD BE A

52
00:01:44,952 --> 00:01:49,322
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THAT

53
00:01:49,323 --> 00:01:50,356
ELIMINATES LIFETIME

54
00:01:50,357 --> 00:01:53,092
APPOINTMENT ON THE SUPREME

55
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:54,494
COURT.

56
00:01:54,495 --> 00:01:55,228
THAT WOULD REDUCE THE ZERO-SUM

57
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:56,963
CHARACTER OF COURT

58
00:01:56,964 --> 00:01:59,832
APPOINTMENTS DENOMINATIONS AND

59
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:00,600
IT WOULD ALLOW THE SUPREME

60
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:01,367
COURT TO MORE CLOSELY REFLECT

61
00:02:01,368 --> 00:02:02,235
THE OUTCOME OF PRESIDENTIAL

62
00:02:02,236 --> 00:02:02,602
ELECTIONS.

63
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:03,336
SO THAT WE COULD REDUCE THE

64
00:02:03,337 --> 00:02:05,838
TEMPTER ON THESE APPOINTMENTS

65
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:06,406
BY GUARANTEEING EVERY

66
00:02:06,407 --> 00:02:07,006
PRESIDENT THE RIGHT TO

67
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:08,574
NOMINATE TWO JUSTICES FOR FOUR

68
00:02:08,574 --> 00:02:12,145
YEAR TERMS BUT YES, YOU'RE

69
00:02:12,146 --> 00:02:13,212
RIGHT, I THINK IF THAT

70
00:02:13,213 --> 00:02:16,949
COMPROMISE IS REJECTED I DO

71
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,352
ENDORSE EXPANDING THE SUPREME

72
00:02:19,353 --> 00:02:20,286
COURT BY AT LEAST TWO SEATS

73
00:02:20,287 --> 00:02:20,953
DEPENDING ON HOW MANY IT

74
00:02:20,954 --> 00:02:21,320
TAKES.

75
00:02:21,321 --> 00:02:22,088
>> JUST TO BE CLEAR, YOU ALSO

76
00:02:22,089 --> 00:02:23,990
SUPPORT A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT

77
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:25,458
INCREASING ANOTHER TWO SEATS

78
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:27,460
AFTER IT, YES.

79
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:28,961
>> I DON'T SEE MUCH OF A

80
00:02:28,962 --> 00:02:33,032
FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENCE.

81
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:33,633
>> YES.

82
00:02:33,634 --> 00:02:34,867
>> 0K WITH REPUBLICAN

83
00:02:34,868 --> 00:02:36,502
PRESIDENT DOING IT.

84
00:02:36,503 --> 00:02:38,171
>> WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT

85
00:02:38,172 --> 00:02:42,175
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MIKE

86
00:02:42,176 --> 00:02:42,975
I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

87
00:02:42,976 --> 00:02:43,876
IF YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT WITH

88
00:02:43,877 --> 00:02:45,044
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT OR NOT.

89
00:02:45,045 --> 00:02:45,745
>> I ALREADY SAID YES, BUT

90
00:02:45,746 --> 00:02:52,952
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY.

91
00:02:52,953 --> 00:02:57,924
[INAUDIBLE]

92
00:02:57,925 --> 00:02:58,658
IF DEMOCRATS INCREASE THE SIZE

93
00:02:58,659 --> 00:02:59,325
OF THE COURT, THEY WILL

94
00:02:59,326 --> 00:03:00,093
CONTROL THE COURT FOR TWO

95
00:03:00,094 --> 00:03:00,860
YEARS OR EIGHT YEARS OR

96
00:03:00,861 --> 00:03:01,327
WHATEVER IT IS.

97
00:03:01,328 --> 00:03:02,028
REPUBLICANS WILL RESPOND AND I

98
00:03:02,029 --> 00:03:04,397
WILL HAVE CONTROL OF COURT

99
00:03:04,398 --> 00:03:04,897
LOOKING BACK.

100
00:03:04,898 --> 00:03:05,698
>> SORRY TO CUT YOU OFF, BUT I

101
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:08,367
THINK YOU'VE JUST MADE THE

102
00:03:08,368 --> 00:03:10,570
ARGUMENT PERFECTLY WHY THIS,

103
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:13,206
EVEN I AS A BRITISH PERSON,

104
00:03:13,207 --> 00:03:16,976
RELATIVELY NEW UNDERSTANDS

105
00:03:16,977 --> 00:03:17,910
THAT THE WHOLE POINT OF THE

106
00:03:17,911 --> 00:03:19,946
SUPREME COURT IS TO BE

107
00:03:19,947 --> 00:03:24,383
DIFFERENT TO THE BRANCHES TO

108
00:03:24,384 --> 00:03:25,151
THE BRANCH THAT'S PART OF

109
00:03:25,152 --> 00:03:25,685
DEMOCRATIC POLITICS.

110
00:03:25,686 --> 00:03:27,687
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED REFLECT THE

111
00:03:27,688 --> 00:03:28,821
POLITICAL MOMENT.

112
00:03:28,822 --> 00:03:34,293
IT'S SUPPOSED TO JUDGE THE

113
00:03:34,294 --> 00:03:34,927
LAW, NOT MAKE THE LAW.

114
00:03:34,928 --> 00:03:35,561
AREN'T YOU ARGUING FOR

115
00:03:35,562 --> 00:03:36,262
SOMETHING THAT'S TOTALLY AT

116
00:03:36,263 --> 00:03:37,063
ODDS WITH THE WHOLE BASIS OF

117
00:03:37,064 --> 00:03:37,497
THE COURT?

118
00:03:37,498 --> 00:03:37,964
>> NO, I'M NOT.

119
00:03:37,965 --> 00:03:41,100
WHAT I WOULD POINT OUT IS, IF

120
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:44,971
YOU HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL

121
00:03:44,972 --> 00:03:47,106
AMENDMENT THAT GIVES EVERY

122
00:03:47,107 --> 00:03:47,874
PRESIDENT THE RIGHT TO APPOINT

123
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:48,641
TWO JUSTICES FOR A FOUR-YEAR

124
00:03:48,642 --> 00:03:49,375
TERM, WE WOULD REDUCE THE

125
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,076
PARTISAN ANCHOR AROUND THESE

126
00:03:50,077 --> 00:03:50,776
APPOINTMENTS BECAUSE IT WOULD

127
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:52,945
MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO RECAPTURE

128
00:03:52,946 --> 00:03:56,949
HER COURT IN FOUR OR EIGHT

129
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:02,655
YEARS.

130
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:07,793
I JUST WANT TO GET THE OTHERS

131
00:04:07,794 --> 00:04:08,127
ENOUGH.

132
00:04:08,128 --> 00:04:13,099
WHAT YOU MAKE OF THIS?

133
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,303
>> IS SILLY.

134
00:04:17,303 --> 00:04:18,837
WE COULD ADD ADDITIONAL

135
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,173
JUSTICES EVERY FOUR YEARS

136
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:21,106
WHENEVER THERE IS A NEW

137
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:23,776
PRESIDENT ELECTED.

138
00:04:23,777 --> 00:04:26,245
LOOK, IT'S A PRACTICAL

139
00:04:26,246 --> 00:04:30,082
IMPOSSIBILITY AND HERE'S WHY.

140
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:30,950
AS YOU POINTED OUT IN YOUR

141
00:04:30,951 --> 00:04:31,584
INTRO, FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT

142
00:04:31,585 --> 00:04:32,952
TRIED THIS IN 1937 BY ADDING

143
00:04:32,953 --> 00:04:37,056
SIX ADDITIONAL JUSTICES.

144
00:04:37,057 --> 00:04:37,823
IT REQUIRES, HOWEVER, AS FDR

145
00:04:37,824 --> 00:04:42,261
FOUND OUT, A LEGISLATIVE ACT,

146
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:43,162
A BILL PASSED BY BOTH HOUSES

147
00:04:43,163 --> 00:04:43,996
OF CONGRESS AND SIGNED BY THE

148
00:04:43,997 --> 00:04:44,363
PRESIDENT.

149
00:04:44,364 --> 00:04:45,131
HIS EFFORTS WERE VIEWED AS SO

150
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:48,701
DEVIOUS AND UNDERHANDED, EVEN

151
00:04:48,702 --> 00:04:50,937
BY DEMOCRATS THAT HIS BILL

152
00:04:50,938 --> 00:04:51,637
DIDN'T EVEN GET OUT OF

153
00:04:51,638 --> 00:04:54,907
COMMITTEE.

154
00:04:54,908 --> 00:04:55,708
IT'S GOES TO THE PRINCIPLES

155
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:56,776
THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED

156
00:04:56,777 --> 00:04:58,778
SINCE 1869 WHEN NINE JUSTICES

157
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:09,889
BECAME THE RULE.

158
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:10,656
>> YOU WERE VERY FIRED UP.

159
00:05:10,657 --> 00:05:11,290
>> IS QUITE DISINGENUOUS.

160
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:11,991
THERE'S A REASON WHY IT'S A

161
00:05:11,992 --> 00:05:12,658
LIFETIME APPOINTMENT SO YOU

162
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:13,259
ARE NOT VULNERABLE TO

163
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:13,793
POLITICAL PRESSURE.

164
00:05:13,794 --> 00:05:18,531
THAT'S THE ENTIRE POINT.

165
00:05:18,532 --> 00:05:19,465
THIS IS WHAT YOU DON'T WANT

166
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:20,266
THEM TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH.

167
00:05:20,267 --> 00:05:21,033
THIS IS A DELIVER THE BODY.

168
00:05:21,034 --> 00:05:22,001
IT SHOULD NOT BE A RESPONSIVE

169
00:05:22,002 --> 00:05:24,604
BODY OR REACTIONARY BODY AND

170
00:05:24,605 --> 00:05:25,538
YET IT'S A REFLECTION OF HOW

171
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:30,977
THE LEFT USES IT.

172
00:05:30,978 --> 00:05:32,945
THEY CAN'T CONVINCE THE

173
00:05:32,946 --> 00:05:34,413
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

174
00:05:34,414 --> 00:05:39,485
I WOULD ALSO ARGUE THAT THIS

175
00:05:39,486 --> 00:05:40,253
ARGUMENT AS WAS ROOSEVELT'S,

176
00:05:40,254 --> 00:05:41,120
WAS PART OF THE ACTION TO

177
00:05:41,121 --> 00:05:43,322
INTIMIDATE THE SITTING JUDGES

178
00:05:43,323 --> 00:05:44,457
NOW, TO SUGGEST THAT IF YOU DO

179
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,725
NOT, IT'S LIKE OF BATTERER.

180
00:05:45,726 --> 00:05:47,927
IF YOU DO NOT COMPLY WE WILL

181
00:05:47,928 --> 00:05:49,562
HURT YOU.

182
00:05:49,563 --> 00:05:52,932
I THINK THAT THE UNDERLYING

183
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:55,635
ARGUMENT ABOUT WHAT THIS IS

184
00:05:55,636 --> 00:05:56,068
ALL ABOUT.

185
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:56,769
>> I DO WANT TO BRING DAVID

186
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:57,536
BAGLEY AND ON THAT POINT

187
00:05:57,537 --> 00:05:58,404
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A CRUCIAL

188
00:05:58,405 --> 00:05:58,704
POINT.

189
00:05:58,705 --> 00:06:00,273
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THIS

190
00:06:00,274 --> 00:06:01,007
BODY THAT IS POLITICAL IN THE

191
00:06:01,008 --> 00:06:04,910
WAY THAT YOU WANTED TO BE.

192
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:05,778
>> RIGHT, BUT I THINK THAT WE

193
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:06,545
CAN SEE FROM WHAT'S HAPPENING

194
00:06:06,546 --> 00:06:08,281
IN OUR POLITICS TODAY THAT THE

195
00:06:08,282 --> 00:06:08,881
FACT THAT SUPREME COURT

196
00:06:08,882 --> 00:06:10,049
JUSTICES HAVE LIFETIME TENURE

197
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,285
MEANS THAT THESE BATTLES TAKE

198
00:06:12,286 --> 00:06:14,887
ON THIS REALLY TERRIBLE

199
00:06:14,888 --> 00:06:20,693
SIGNIFICANCE IN OUR POLITICS.

200
00:06:20,694 --> 00:06:21,460
IT CREATES A ZERO-SUM BATTLE

201
00:06:21,461 --> 00:06:22,128
OVER THESE COURT APARTMENTS

202
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:24,964
AND IF YOU JUST AMENDED THE

203
00:06:24,965 --> 00:06:26,799
CONSTITUTION --

204
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,534
>> OKAY LET ME GET CHARLIE

205
00:06:28,535 --> 00:06:29,669
VERY QUICKLY.

206
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:37,343
>> TIMMY MADE A GRADE

207
00:06:37,344 --> 00:06:37,376
>> TIMMY MADE A GREDE

208
00:06:37,377 --> 00:06:37,610
>> TIMMY MADE A GREAT

209
00:06:37,611 --> 00:06:38,311
POINT BUT WHAT IS A JUDGE.

210
00:06:38,312 --> 00:06:39,011
IS IT AN ACTIVIST OR

211
00:06:39,012 --> 00:06:39,645
INTIMIDATION OF THE LAW.

212
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:40,946
WE BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE AN

213
00:06:40,947 --> 00:06:48,688
INDEPENDENT ARBITER AND

214
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:49,121
INTERPRETERS.

215
00:06:49,122 --> 00:06:49,855
THEY BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE AN

216
00:06:49,856 --> 00:06:50,489
ACTIVIST TO ADVANCE THEIR

217
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:50,823
AGENDA.

218
00:06:50,824 --> 00:06:51,490
HE'S UPSET BECAUSE WE HAVE

219
00:06:51,491 --> 00:06:52,224
FIVE JUSTICES THAT WILL LOOK

220
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:52,892
AT WHAT THE TEXT SAYS, NOT

221
00:06:52,893 --> 00:06:53,526
WHAT THEY HOPE IT SAYS.

222
00:06:53,527 --> 00:06:54,260
THIS IS A WAR ON THE

223
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:55,328
CONSTITUTION AND THE RULE OF

224
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:56,395
LAW AND HE'S NOT UPSET THAT WE

225
00:06:56,396 --> 00:07:00,599
CAN'T GET MEDICAID FOR ALL.

226
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,067
[INAUDIBLE]

227
00:07:01,068 --> 00:07:01,767
>> ALSO THE BOOK IS CALLED

228
00:07:01,768 --> 00:07:02,468
IT'S TIME TO FIGHT DIRTY SO

229
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:04,403
YOU SORT OF SEE WHAT HE'S

230
00:07:04,404 --> 00:07:04,837
THINKING.

231
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:08,941
>> ALSO ELECTIONS HAVE

232
00:07:08,942 --> 00:07:10,042
CONSEQUENCES.

233
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:10,810
YOU KNOW HOW MAY PEOPLE

234
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:11,510
HILLARY CLINTON HAS CONFIRMED

235
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:12,211
TO THE SUPREME COURT #ZERO

236
00:07:12,212 --> 00:07:13,412
BECAUSE SHE LOST.

237
00:07:13,413 --> 00:07:14,080
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS HAD TO

238
00:07:14,081 --> 00:07:14,547
BECAUSE HE WON.

239
00:07:14,548 --> 00:07:21,053
THAT IS HOW IT WORKS.

240
00:07:21,054 --> 00:07:21,987
THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRATS DO AS

241
00:07:21,988 --> 00:07:22,621
YOU POINTED OUT EARLIER.

242
00:07:22,622 --> 00:07:23,389
WHEN THEY LOSE THEY TRY TO

243
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:23,856
CHANGE THE GAME.

244
00:07:23,857 --> 00:07:24,657
ONE PRESIDENT TRUMP WON WE HAD

245
00:07:24,658 --> 00:07:25,591
TO GET RID OF THE ELECTORAL

246
00:07:25,592 --> 00:07:27,193
COLLEGE AND ALSO CALLING FOR

247
00:07:27,194 --> 00:07:33,666
DEFECTORS TO DEFECT, BUT

248
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:34,433
WHAT'S HILARIOUS IS THAT MORE

249
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:35,101
PEOPLE WENT AGAINST HILLARY

250
00:07:35,102 --> 00:07:35,835
CLINTON WITHOUT THEM PRESIDENT

251
00:07:35,836 --> 00:07:37,002
TRUMP SO BACKFIRED.

252
00:07:37,003 --> 00:07:43,209
>> ONE CORRECTION, HE

253
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:43,976
CONTINUES TO SAY THAT THE

254
00:07:43,977 --> 00:07:44,643
DIVISION IN THIS DYNAMIC,

255
00:07:44,644 --> 00:07:45,244
THERE IS NO DIVISION.

256
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:45,911
IT'S ONLY THE DEMOCRATS WHO

257
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:46,278
GET UPSET.

258
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:50,316
WE'VE NEVER DONE THAT.

259
00:07:50,317 --> 00:07:51,217
>> IS ONE OTHER THING, I JUST

260
00:07:51,218 --> 00:07:52,118
WANT TO SAY THANKS FOR COMING

261
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:55,087
ON AND DEBATING IT, BUT THE

262
00:07:55,088 --> 00:07:57,823
LEFT'S REACTION TO LEADERS IN

263
00:07:57,824 --> 00:00:00,000
OTHER COUNTRIES, THERE'S
