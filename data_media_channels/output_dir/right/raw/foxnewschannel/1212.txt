189
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,864
FLY A KITE AT THE BEACH.

190
00:05:18,864 --> 00:05:20,232
THIS IS KITE TERRORISM.

191
00:05:20,232 --> 00:05:22,301
THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND

192
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:23,903
MINISTRY OF FINANCE WILL PROVIDE

193
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:25,204
FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR FARMERS IN

194
00:05:25,204 --> 00:05:28,007
THE GAZA BELT WHO HAVE SUFFERED

195
00:05:28,007 --> 00:05:29,241
MATERIAL DAMAGE FROM FLAMMABLE

196
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:33,979
KITES AND HELIUM BALLOONS THAT

197
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:36,415
HAVE BEEN SENT OVER WITH THE AIM

198
00:05:36,415 --> 00:05:37,950
OF SETTING FIELDS ON FIRE.

199
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,185
THERE ARE NEW MEASURES TO COMBAT

200
00:05:40,185 --> 00:05:41,987
KITES INCLUDING SPECIALIZED

201
00:05:41,987 --> 00:05:43,589
DRONES TO NEUTRALIZE THEM.

202
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:45,925
THEY'VE SHELLED OUT $300,000

203
00:05:45,925 --> 00:05:46,525
WORTH OF DAMAGE.

204
00:05:46,525 --> 00:05:48,928
DID YOU EVER EXPECT TO SEE KITES

205
00:05:48,928 --> 00:05:50,963
FLYING OVER THE BORDER, DROPPING

206
00:05:50,963 --> 00:05:52,398
GASOLINE BOMBS?

207
00:05:52,398 --> 00:05:54,300
>> THE HISTORY OF HAMAS, THEY

208
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,601
FOCUS ON DESTRUCTION AND HATE.

209
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:58,437
WE THINK HOW TO BUILD, HOW TO

210
00:05:58,437 --> 00:05:59,972
SUPPORT PALESTINIANS.

211
00:05:59,972 --> 00:06:01,573
THEY PUT A LOT OF ENERGY AND

212
00:06:01,573 --> 00:06:02,875
THEY'RE VERY CREATIVE, FINDING

213
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,610
WAYS TO BURN FIELDS IN ISRAEL,

214
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,046
FINDING WAYS TO DIG TUNNELS.

215
00:06:07,046 --> 00:06:08,547
WHY DON'T THEY PUT THAT ENERGY

216
00:06:08,547 --> 00:06:11,383
INTO THE PALESTINIANS IN GAZA

217
00:06:11,383 --> 00:06:13,118
WHO ARE SUFFERING EVERY DAY.

218
00:06:13,118 --> 00:06:13,819
IT'S CYNICAL.

219
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:15,654
IT'S PITIFUL.

220
00:06:15,654 --> 00:06:18,357
I HOPE ONE DAY PALESTINIANS WILL

221
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:20,993
BE STRONG ENOUGH TO SAY ENOUGH

222
00:06:20,993 --> 00:06:23,062
FOR THE HAMAS REGIME.

223
00:06:23,062 --> 00:06:24,430
>> ERIC: THEY VOTED THEM IN.

224
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,031
THEY USE A LOT OF CONCRETE NOT

225
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:28,067
FOR THE ROADS BUT TO BUILD

226
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:28,467
TUNNELS.

227
00:06:28,467 --> 00:00:00,000
IT IS CONTINUING.
