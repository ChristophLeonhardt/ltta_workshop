martin shkreli's trial continues this is the notorious pharma bro who decided to increase the price of a drug from something affordable around $13 a pill to $750 a pill and so that's how he got his claim to fame but he is facing trial for something completely different and in the middle of this trial someone who has testified against him his former hedge fund manager shared a letter that shkreli had mailed to him addressed to his wife and it shows you just how incredibly disgusting this guy really is so in this letter which again was addressed to the hedge fund managers wife shkreli wrote I hope to see you and your four children homeless I will do whatever I can to assure this your husband's arrogance is infuriating and making an enemy out of me is a mistake okay so a threatening message obviously and just a disgusting message who gets excited at the thought of seeing children homeless yes Martin shkreli does but just to give you some background on this case he is being prosecuted because of his businesses prosecutors contend that mr. shkreli funneled shares of retro Fionn to his hedge fund manager that's mr. Perotti and others keeping the allotments just under the threshold for reporting requirements and controlled huge parts of Retro friend through scheme through the scheme without reporting that to financial regulators so what he did is he urged people around him to buy shares and then sell them and then buy them so he's trying to manipulate you know the market and in December of 2012 mr. shkreli arranged for mr. Perotti to be part of a group buying stakes in retro fen which was about to go public through a reverse merger into a shell company mr. Perotti agreed to pay $400 for 400,000 shares he testified now why would Ellie sent him that threatening message well at one point shkreli told him you need to sell me back the shares sell me back the shares and apparently he refused to do so and I'll eventually he just let go and he's like fine I'll show you about I'll sell back the shares but I mean you're manipulating yeah you know you're manipulating things you're doing something illegal you're sending someone a threatening letter and now that threatening letter is being used as evidence against him in this case yeah I saw one of the most aggravating videos you could watch it was a vice video where a vice reporter goes and hangs out with Martin shkreli and plays chess at his house and it's just the most aggravating thing and after watching it you kind of understand that the personality of Martin shkreli is such that he doesn't know how to get people to like him he doesn't know how to do that I don't think he cares I think he absolutely cares more than anyone has ever cared about being liked and he can figure out how to make a lot of money off the stock market make a lot of money over price gouging and get financial gain but the one thing that he does not know how to do is make people like him which is compounded in its terribleness by the fact that the one the other thing he knows how to do besides make money is to get people to hate him he doesn't know how to get the positive reinforcement he only knows what to do to push people's buttons and so every time an idea on how to do that reaches his brain he goes right for it mm-hmm he knows how to be the biggest douchebag in the universe so when you were watching the chess thing what kind of thing struck you okay so he sits back and he goes um let's open a Magnum bottle of 2005 Chateau Rouge want on I don't know what the whatever the Chateau was but then he sits down and he starts drinking it yeah it's a bottle of wine and she makes a move and he goes so do you do the strategic do you do the Spanish defense very often is that what you typically do when you play chess and it's she's like I have no idea what you're talking about and he goes and then just he finds a way to be like yeah cuz okay it's very obvious that I thought you were doing it but it's just obviously know so little about chess you're not a good chess player just like instantly tiny things like that how did she react to that she's an idiot she's a vice reporter oh come on come on she's like he goes off when they're walking down the street she's like he's like I really like to gauge the prices and he says something also like that's Pfizer they do unethical stuff when it comes to price gouging all the time and instead of at least pointing out the insane irony in that very like a Daily Show reporter would just be like said you know anyone else like that instead she goes it's really cold why are you wearing that jacket really yes okay we'll send a moron to deal with an asshole suitable companies certainly do participate in price gouging right martin shkreli's stood out because he got super greedy and went too far 5,600 500 percent increase in daraprim which is fights toxoplasmosis and AIDS patients and he's not on trial for that like he's not on trial that was a good vice article I read that was like.he error maybe I think it was vice it was like he's not on trial for that yeah he's on trial for robbing from other folks that were also trying to gouge price that's right that's right and so I don't know if you can rob people in need you can exploit the powerless as much as you want but you can't take advantage of the wealthy yeah weird he's just he's just a ball of neuroses with hatred in this happens qit membership gets you commercial free young turks downloaded stream at podcasts that get all the network shows and support independent media TYT Network comm slash join
