1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,960
How did Ouija become so...
overrated?

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,900
It was gonna spell "Overrated."

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,060
Ouija is not overrated just because the board’s
powers aren’t real.

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:20,640
We know it’s powered by the psychological
ideomotor effect — a type of subconscious

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,589
movement that guides the responses.

6
00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:30,160
But that doesn’t explain why this kinda
crappy board is such a big part of our lives

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:38,700
and why Ouija and Ouija ripoffs are what you
see over and over again in TV and movies.

8
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,080
Really.

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,700
Bad.

10
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,710
Movies.

11
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,380
“I found a Ouija board here.

12
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,220
We’re gonna play it tonight.”

13
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:55,360
OK, but the real shock is that this piece
of cardboard has a story that spans two centuries

14
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,600
and actually says something about our history
and our culture.

15
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:11,160
“There is no Death!
What seems so is transition;

16
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:16,530
this life of mortal breath
Is but a suburb of the Life Elysian

17
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,830
Whose portal we call Death.”

18
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,650
That’s from Longfellow.

19
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:26,280
The same legendary poet who wrote about the
midnight ride of Paul Revere.

20
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,990
In the 1800s, spiritualism and Americanism
were intertwined in weird ways.

21
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:39,340
Though what we call spiritualism started in
the early to mid 1800s in Europe — seances,

22
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:46,160
ghost stuff, etc — it really picked up in
the US in the 1850s and 1860s.

23
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,660
The Civil War caused around a million casualties.

24
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,320
But more broadly, death was a constant.

25
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:02,840
This chart shows life expectancy from 1850
to 1910.

26
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,010
That jump in the chart?

27
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,960
That’s from 40 to just 50 years old.

28
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:13,170
One response to that presence of death?

29
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,900
Hundreds of spiritualism newspapers like Banner
of Light.

30
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:23,650
It even had a column filled with messages
that claimed to be from the spirit world beyond.

31
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,100
Ooh, this guy says he was a rumseller.

32
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,580
That sounds fun.

33
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,260
This spiritual fixation endured.

34
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:40,750
That Longfellow poem was the epigraph to a
hit book in 1891 - the bestselling “There

35
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,980
Is No Death.”

36
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,160
So where does Ouija fit in?

37
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,280
For that, you have to go to the patent office.

38
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,209
These are all talking board patents from the
1890s and 1900s.

39
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,400
Oh, this one was French.

40
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,780
This patent from 1891 is the direct ancestor
to Ouija.

41
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:12,620
Fittingly, the game has a murky origin, but
Americans Elijah Bond and Charles Kennard

42
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,300
were behind this version.

43
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,849
It has all of the ingredients:
the board with Yes and No,

44
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:24,040
and a planchette - that’s the name for the
pointy thing that picks your letters.

45
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,480
There are theories about the name — some
say it was for the novelist Ouida — that’s

46
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,300
O-U-I-D-A.

47
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,370
Others claimed the board itself spelled its
own name.

48
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,580
But the most likely explanation is that it
was Egyptian-sounding, since that’s how

49
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,230
it was marketed and explained on that first
patent.

50
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:49,050
The next year, entrepreneur William Fuld patented
his own talking board.

51
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:54,420
But Ouija was the brand that took off - so
Fuld and company bought it.

52
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,200
The spirits pointed to profit.

53
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,080
He fended off tons of competitors — including
his own family members — and built a name.

54
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:09,260
He had legal backing, like this 1915 patent,
as Ouija took off.

55
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:17,580
The spirit world finally had what had eluded
it in life: a solid brand identity.

56
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:25,560
When the Washington Times did a puff article
on mental trouble in DC, they didn’t mention

57
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,280
“talking boards” - they mentioned “Ouija.”

58
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,080
When Pearl Curran claimed to have written
novels by channeling her Ouija board —

59
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,580
Wait.

60
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,080
What?

61
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,120
Yeah, that’s what it says.

62
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,000
Alright —
She wrote under the name of the spirit she

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,370
allegedly contacted — Patience Worth.

64
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,240
She used Ouija.

65
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,430
This brand kept Ouija going through the 20th
century, along with Fuld’s legal maintenance.

66
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:58,850
The spirit world went corporate, further merging
pop culture and the occult.

67
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,680
AH!

68
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,500
Today...

69
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,800
Today, Ouija is a little horror, a little
kitsch, and a little fun.

70
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,490
There have been corporate shifts, but the
board is a staple, which is a pretty impressive

71
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:23,110
journey for a simple image and a piece of
plastic.

72
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:28,120
That journey was powered by the beliefs of
people like Longfellow and the mysterious

73
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,199
forces of the United States patent system.

74
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,060
And we are being spoken to, in a way, by people
from the past.

75
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:42,460
Not through messages from the spirit realm,
but through the history of a decorated piece

76
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,650
of cardboard.

77
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,210
Ouija might be overrated, and it’s not real.

78
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,020
But it might be saying something, too.

79
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,100
There are many great Ouija stories out there.

80
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:03,580
One of my favorites is that in 1921, William
Fuld was forced to admit Ouija was a children’s

81
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,580
toy.

82
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,669
The reason?

83
00:06:05,669 --> 00:00:00,000
Tax purposes.
