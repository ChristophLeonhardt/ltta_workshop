00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,361
GREG.

2
00:00:01,361 --> 00:00:02,495
IT'S 5:00 IN NEW YORK CITY AND

3
00:00:02,495 --> 00:00:10,170
THIS IS "THE FIVE" ."

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,005
PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST WRAPPING UP

5
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:14,407
A MEETING WITH FBI DIRECTOR

6
00:00:14,407 --> 00:00:14,974
CHRIS WRAY, DEPUTY

7
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:17,143
ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN,

8
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:17,677
DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL

9
00:00:17,677 --> 00:00:18,878
INTELLIGENCE DAN COATS AT THE

10
00:00:18,878 --> 00:00:19,279
WHITE HOUSE.

11
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,614
THIS COMES AS THE PRESIDENT IS

12
00:00:21,614 --> 00:00:23,883
DEMANDING ANSWERS OVER A SERIES

13
00:00:23,883 --> 00:00:25,385
OF REPORTS THAT AN FBI INFORMANT

14
00:00:25,385 --> 00:00:27,554
WAS IN CONTACT WITH ASSOCIATES

15
00:00:27,554 --> 00:00:28,555
OF HIS CAMPAIGN.

16
00:00:28,555 --> 00:00:30,223
TRUMPET TWEETING THAT THE DOJ

17
00:00:30,223 --> 00:00:32,759
NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE IF THE

18
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,961
CAMPAIGN WAS "INFILTRATED OR

19
00:00:34,961 --> 00:00:35,628
SURVEILLED AND IF THE OBAMA

20
00:00:35,628 --> 00:00:37,363
ADMINISTRATION WAS INVOLVED."

21
00:00:37,363 --> 00:00:39,399
DOJ IS RESPONDING BY ASKING ITS

22
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:40,066
INSPECTOR GENERAL TO LOOK AT

23
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:42,402
THESE ALLEGATIONS.

24
00:00:42,402 --> 00:00:43,336
VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT PENCE IS

25
00:00:43,336 --> 00:00:45,738
REACTING TO THE LATEST

26
00:00:45,738 --> 00:00:47,540
DEVELOPMENT IN A SIT DOWN WITH

27
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,041
MARTHA MacCALLUM.

28
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:49,642
>> THE PRESIDENT I THINK HE IS

29
00:00:49,642 --> 00:00:50,543
GRATEFUL THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF

30
00:00:50,543 --> 00:00:52,612
JUSTICE IS GOING TO HAVE THE

31
00:00:52,612 --> 00:00:54,614
INSPECTOR GENERAL LOOK INTO IT

32
00:00:54,614 --> 00:00:56,382
AND DETERMINE AND ENSURE THAT

33
00:00:56,382 --> 00:00:58,918
THERE WAS NO SURVEILLANCE DONE

34
00:00:58,918 --> 00:01:01,788
FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES.

35
00:01:01,788 --> 00:01:02,555
AGAINST OUR CAMPAIGN.

36
00:01:02,555 --> 00:01:05,558
I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY

37
00:01:05,558 --> 00:01:06,459
TROUBLING TO MILLIONS OF

38
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:09,095
AMERICANS OF THAT TOOK PLACE.

39
00:01:09,095 --> 00:01:09,929
>> Jesse: HOUSE COMMITTEE

40
00:01:09,929 --> 00:01:10,964
CHAIRMAN DEVIN NUNES IS SAYING

41
00:01:10,964 --> 00:01:13,466
IF THIS IS TRUE, IT'S A MAJOR

42
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:14,167
SCANDAL.

43
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:16,736
>> IF THEY RAN A SPY RING OR

44
00:01:16,736 --> 00:01:18,705
INFORMANT RING AND THEY WERE

45
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:20,974
PAYING PEOPLE WITHIN THE TRUMP

46
00:01:20,974 --> 00:01:22,976
CAMPAIGN, IF ANY OF THAT IS

47
00:01:22,976 --> 00:01:24,611
TRUE, THAT IS AN ABSOLUTE

48
00:01:24,611 --> 00:01:24,978
REDLINE.

49
00:01:24,978 --> 00:01:27,947
YOU CAN DO THIS TO POLITICAL

50
00:01:27,947 --> 00:01:28,414
CAMPAIGNS.

51
00:01:28,414 --> 00:01:32,051
ACCORDING TO THEM, THIS WAS DONE

52
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:33,186
IN THE SPRING BEFORE THE

53
00:01:33,186 --> 00:01:34,154
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

54
00:01:34,154 --> 00:01:34,954
INVESTIGATION WAS EVEN OPENED.

55
00:01:34,954 --> 00:01:37,357
IF THAT'S TRUE, WE NEED TO KNOW

56
00:01:37,357 --> 00:01:38,558
ABOUT IT.

57
00:01:38,558 --> 00:01:39,859
>> Jesse: MEANWHILE FORMER DOJ

58
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:41,794
OFFICIAL SALLY YATES IS LOSING

59
00:01:41,794 --> 00:01:43,463
IT OVER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

60
00:01:43,463 --> 00:01:43,796
REQUEST.

61
00:01:43,796 --> 00:01:44,497
>> WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS THE

62
00:01:44,497 --> 00:01:47,500
PRESIDENT HAS TAKEN HIS ALL-OUT

63
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,234
ASSAULT ON THE RULE OF LAW TO A

64
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:51,371
NEW LEVEL.

65
00:01:51,371 --> 00:01:54,140
THIS TIME HE IS ORDERING UP AN

66
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,807
INVESTIGATION OF THE

67
00:01:54,807 --> 00:01:55,375
INVESTIGATORS.

68
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:57,544
WHO ARE EXAMINING HIS OWN

69
00:01:57,544 --> 00:01:58,778
CAMPAIGN.

70
00:01:58,778 --> 00:02:00,079
THAT'S REALLY SHOCKING.

71
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,582
>> Jesse: ALL RIGHT, YOU WOULD

72
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:03,983
EXPECT PEOPLE FROM THE OBAMA

73
00:02:03,983 --> 00:02:05,084
ADMINISTRATION TO SAY THINGS

74
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:07,554
LIKE THAT, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR

75
00:02:07,554 --> 00:02:09,222
JOHN BRENNAN ALSO LASHED OUT ON

76
00:02:09,222 --> 00:02:09,756
TWITTER.

77
00:02:09,756 --> 00:02:12,425
BUT IF THIS INFORMATION IS

78
00:02:12,425 --> 00:02:13,226
CORRECT, KIMBERLY, HOW

79
00:02:13,226 --> 00:02:15,628
DEVASTATING WOULD IT BE FOR OUR

80
00:02:15,628 --> 00:02:16,429
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES?

81
00:02:16,429 --> 00:02:17,830
>> Kimberly: IT IS QUITE

82
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:18,698
DISCONCERTING WHEN YOU THINK

83
00:02:18,698 --> 00:02:19,399
ABOUT THAT.

84
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:21,534
IF THERE'S ACTUALLY AN ACTIVE

85
00:02:21,534 --> 00:02:22,535
SPY OPERATION WITHIN A CAMPAIGN,

86
00:02:22,535 --> 00:02:23,236
YOU WOULD HOPE THAT IF THEY

87
00:02:23,236 --> 00:02:24,871
THOUGHT THERE WAS A VEIN THAT

88
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:26,239
WAS AT RISK WITH RESPECT TO

89
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,341
RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE, THAT THEY

90
00:02:28,341 --> 00:02:32,145
WOULD IN FACT GO TO CANDIDATE

91
00:02:32,145 --> 00:02:33,379
TRUMP AT THE TIME OR SOME

92
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:34,781
OFFICIAL IN THE CAMPAIGN AND SAY

93
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:36,583
LISTEN WE HAVE SOME

94
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:37,483
INFORMATION WE BELIEVE PERHAPS

95
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:38,484
YOUR CAMPAIGN COULD HAVE AN

96
00:02:38,484 --> 00:02:40,186
ISSUE AND SOMEONE COULD TRY TO

97
00:02:40,186 --> 00:02:41,387
GET INVOLVED OR TRIED TO GET

98
00:02:41,387 --> 00:02:43,790
INTELLIGENCE FROM YOU.

99
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,758
BUT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

100
00:02:45,758 --> 00:02:47,560
IT'S SORT OF BELIES THAT TRUTH

101
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,562
AND ACCURACY OF IT, AND THEN YOU

102
00:02:49,562 --> 00:02:50,496
SAW "THE NEW YORK TIMES" PREEMPT

103
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,599
AND PUT THIS OUT THERE IN

104
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:57,770
ADVANCE OF THE IG REPORT WHICH

105
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:02,575
IS EXPECTED TO BE DAMNING.

106
00:03:02,575 --> 00:03:03,977
THEY SAY WE ARE LOOKING TO

107
00:03:03,977 --> 00:03:04,377
PROTECT YOU.

108
00:03:04,377 --> 00:03:04,944
IT DOESN'T RING TRUE.

109
00:03:04,944 --> 00:03:06,913
WHY WOULDN'T YOU BE TRANSPARENT

110
00:03:06,913 --> 00:03:11,184
AND TELL THEM INSTEAD OF TRYING

111
00:03:11,184 --> 00:03:11,784
TO ENTRAP?

112
00:03:11,784 --> 00:03:15,822
THE FBI'S JOB IS NOT TO SPY ON

113
00:03:15,822 --> 00:03:16,689
CAMPAIGNS OR PLAY SOMEBODY

114
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:18,758
WITHIN AN ORGANIZATION LIKE THAT

115
00:03:18,758 --> 00:03:19,225
WITHIN AN ORGANIZATION LIKE THA

116
00:03:19,225 --> 00:03:20,059
THAT.

117
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:22,362
COMPLETELY OUT-OF-BOUNDS.

118
00:03:22,362 --> 00:03:23,963
>> Jesse: COMEY SAID HE WAS

119
00:03:23,963 --> 00:03:25,498
SUSPICIOUS IN THE SPRING OF

120
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:27,400
2016, DECIDED NOT TO INFORM THE

121
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,601
CAMPAIGN IN THE SPRING THAT THE

122
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:30,169
RUSSIANS MIGHT BE UP TO

123
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:30,536
SOMETHING.

124
00:03:30,536 --> 00:03:32,572
AND THEN THEY LOOKED AT

125
00:03:32,572 --> 00:03:33,973
PAPADOPOULOS I THINK IN JULY OR

126
00:03:33,973 --> 00:03:35,875
AUGUST, GREG, THEY DIDN'T EVEN

127
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,378
INTERVIEW HIM UNTIL JANUARY.

128
00:03:38,378 --> 00:03:39,946
THEY WAITED SIX MONTHS.

129
00:03:39,946 --> 00:03:41,281
WHY NOT, IF PAPADOPOULOS HAD

130
00:03:41,281 --> 00:03:42,148
HEARD SOMETHING, WHY NOT ASK

131
00:03:42,148 --> 00:03:43,716
THEM STRAIGHT UP WHAT IS GOING

132
00:03:43,716 --> 00:03:44,951
ON?

133
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:46,719
>> Greg: THE MORE THEY KEEP

134
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,420
TRYING TO FIND COLLUSION, THE

135
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,888
MORE THEY FIND DEMOCRATS.

136
00:03:48,888 --> 00:03:50,723
THIS SCANDAL OR PSEUDO-SCANDAL

137
00:03:50,723 --> 00:03:54,260
IS ACTUALLY EASIER TO EXPLAIN TO

138
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,396
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC THAT ALL OF

139
00:03:56,396 --> 00:03:58,598
THE OTHER COLLUSION STUFF.

140
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:00,566
THEY SENT AN INFORMANT INTO TRAP

141
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:01,567
TRUMP.

142
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:02,468
I LOVE THE MEDIA EXPLANATION FOR

143
00:04:02,468 --> 00:04:04,971
THIS.

144
00:04:04,971 --> 00:04:06,773
WE ONLY SENT THIS INFORMANT IN

145
00:04:06,773 --> 00:04:07,607
THERE TO PROTECT DONALD TRUMP.

146
00:04:07,607 --> 00:04:09,175
WE WERE SPYING ON YOU AS A

147
00:04:09,175 --> 00:04:09,976
FAVOR.

148
00:04:09,976 --> 00:04:11,778
THAT IS LIKE SAYING THAT I AM

149
00:04:11,778 --> 00:04:13,546
STALKING YOU AS A FAVOR.

150
00:04:13,546 --> 00:04:15,014
ICE TOOL YOUR CAR SO NO ONE ELSE

151
00:04:15,014 --> 00:04:16,783
WOULD STEAL YOUR CAR.

152
00:04:16,783 --> 00:04:19,319
IT'S THE PLOT OF "NATIONAL

153
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:21,321
TREASURE" WHEN NICOLAS CAGE

154
00:04:21,321 --> 00:04:24,824
STEALS THE DECLARATION OF

155
00:04:24,824 --> 00:04:27,360
INDEPENDENCE.

156
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,795
WHY DID THIS HAPPEN?

157
00:04:28,795 --> 00:04:30,163
WHY DID JOHN BRENNAN, WHY DID

158
00:04:30,163 --> 00:04:31,964
THEY DO THIS SET UP, WHY DID

159
00:04:31,964 --> 00:04:32,999
THEY SET THE TRAP?

160
00:04:32,999 --> 00:04:35,702
I BELIEVE THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE

161
00:04:35,702 --> 00:04:36,602
DOING GOD'S WORK.

162
00:04:36,602 --> 00:04:38,504
THAT THEY WERE ENERGIZED BY THE

163
00:04:38,504 --> 00:04:40,973
FRANTIC ALARMIST MEDIA ABOUT

164
00:04:40,973 --> 00:04:42,375
TRUMP OF WHICH I INCLUDE MYSELF

165
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,577
BECAUSE I WAS EVERY BIT AS

166
00:04:44,577 --> 00:04:45,778
WORRIED ABOUT TRUMP AS ANYBODY

167
00:04:45,778 --> 00:04:46,412
DURING THE CAMPAIGN.

168
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:48,815
I HAVE TO SAY I AM PART OF THE

169
00:04:48,815 --> 00:04:49,315
ALARMIST MEDIA.

170
00:04:49,315 --> 00:04:50,583
I THINK IF YOU WATCH THE NEWS

171
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,318
AND YOU ARE PART OF THE NEWS AND

172
00:04:52,318 --> 00:04:55,188
YOU ARE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT,

173
00:04:55,188 --> 00:04:57,023
YOU CONVINCE YOURSELF THAT IF

174
00:04:57,023 --> 00:04:58,257
TRUMP BECAME PRESIDENT, THE

175
00:04:58,257 --> 00:04:59,992
COUNTRY WOULD BE IN PERIL.

176
00:04:59,992 --> 00:05:01,194
THEREFORE DOING SOMETHING LIKE

177
00:05:01,194 --> 00:05:04,564
THIS, WHICH IS ILLEGAL, IS

178
00:05:04,564 --> 00:05:05,098
ACTUALLY PATRIOTIC.

179
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:08,167
>> Jesse: THAT'S WHAT PETER

180
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:08,735
STRZOK HIMSELF TEXTED.

181
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,370
>> Greg: BUT THEY ARE WRONG.

182
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,504
I ADMIT I WAS WRONG.

183
00:05:11,504 --> 00:05:13,005
THEY HAVE TO ADMIT THEY ARE

184
00:05:13,005 --> 00:05:13,406
WRONG.

185
00:05:13,406 --> 00:05:15,475
THEY MIGHT HAVE TO GO TO JAIL.

186
00:05:15,475 --> 00:05:16,876
>> Jesse: YOU ARE MAKING MORE

187
00:05:16,876 --> 00:05:20,012
MONEY THAN USUAL.

188
00:05:20,012 --> 00:05:21,214
THANK YOU, DONALD TRUMP.

189
00:05:21,214 --> 00:05:21,714
>> Greg: [LAUGHS]

190
00:05:21,714 --> 00:05:23,783
>> Jesse: NOW THAT THE

191
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:25,284
PRESIDENT HAS ASKED THE DOJ TO

192
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:26,619
DO THIS, FLIPPING THE SCRIPT,

193
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:28,654
WHAT WILL IT DO TO THE MUELLER

194
00:05:28,654 --> 00:05:30,723
INVESTIGATION.

195
00:05:30,723 --> 00:05:33,192
DOES IT ELONGATED?

196
00:05:33,192 --> 00:05:34,327
>> Dana: I SAW CHRIS CHRISTIE

197
00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:35,962
DOING AN INTERVIEW TODAY WHERE

198
00:05:35,962 --> 00:05:37,597
HE SAID THAT HE HAS GIVEN

199
00:05:37,597 --> 00:05:39,399
PRESIDENT TRUMP A LOT OF ADVICE

200
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,366
AND HE SAID HE TELLS THEM THERE

201
00:05:40,366 --> 00:05:41,801
ARE WAYS TO SHORTEN THIS

202
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:42,802
INVESTIGATION AND WAYS TO MAKE

203
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:44,370
IT LONGER.

204
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,538
SO FAR, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS

205
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:46,906
TAKEN EVERY STEP TO MAKE IT

206
00:05:46,906 --> 00:05:47,240
LONGER.

207
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,541
I DON'T KNOW.

208
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:56,182
I DON'T KNOW IF WITH      WHEN

209
00:05:56,182 --> 00:05:56,916
RUDY GIULIANI SAID MUELLER TOLD

210
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:57,583
ME IT WOULD BE WRAPPED UP BY

211
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:58,017
DECEMBER 1ST.

212
00:05:58,017 --> 00:05:58,751
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I WOULD SAY

213
00:05:58,751 --> 00:05:59,051
THAT.

214
00:05:59,051 --> 00:06:02,789
I'M WILLING TO BELIEVE THE OBAMA

215
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:04,390
TEAM HAD DONE THIS.

216
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,192
THEY WERE POLITICALLY MOTIVATED.

217
00:06:06,192 --> 00:06:08,261
BUT ALL OF THESE THINGS, IF IT'S

218
00:06:08,261 --> 00:06:10,396
TRUE, IF IT'S TRUE, IF IT'S TRUE

219
00:06:10,396 --> 00:06:12,165
REMINDS ME OF THEY WIRETAPPED ME

220
00:06:12,165 --> 00:06:13,065
UP TRUMP TOWER WHICH TURNS OUT

221
00:06:13,065 --> 00:06:13,800
NOT TO HAVE BEEN THE CASE.

222
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,902
I GUESS WE DON'T KNOW, AND THUS

223
00:06:15,902 --> 00:06:17,203
MAY BE IN THE WHOLE

224
00:06:17,203 --> 00:06:19,205
INVESTIGATION WE FOUND OUT THAT

225
00:06:19,205 --> 00:06:20,540
SOMEBODY ON THE CAMPAIGN DID

226
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,240
HAVE A WIRETAP.

227
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,977
A >> Jesse: I THINK MANAFORT

228
00:06:24,977 --> 00:06:26,179
HAD AN APARTMENT AT TRUMP TOWER.

229
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:28,080
>> Dana: MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T

230
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,082
OF HIRED MANAFORT.

231
00:06:30,082 --> 00:06:31,818
I AM WILLING TO WAIT FOR THE

232
00:06:31,818 --> 00:06:33,419
EVIDENCE AND I THINK OF THE

233
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:34,787
INSPECTOR GENERAL HOWEVER ONE

234
00:06:34,787 --> 00:06:35,655
SEEMS TO ADMIRE AT LEAST SO FAR

235
00:06:35,655 --> 00:06:36,622
UNTIL HE SAYS SOMETHING THEY

236
00:06:36,622 --> 00:06:38,124
DON'T LIE, THAT EVERYONE THINKS

237
00:06:38,124 --> 00:06:40,126
HE'S DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB,

238
00:06:40,126 --> 00:06:43,262
THEY'RE WAITING FOR THE REPORT

239
00:06:43,262 --> 00:06:46,566
ON SECRETARY CLINTON'S EMAIL.

240
00:06:46,566 --> 00:06:48,134
I THINK THE HILLARY CLINTON TEAM

241
00:06:48,134 --> 00:06:50,703
HAS A RIGHT TO BE SOMEWHAT MAD,

242
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:51,471
THAT THEIR POSITION IS YOU MEAN

243
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:53,439
TO TELL ME THAT THE FBI WAS

244
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,708
WILLING TO GO OUT ON THE RECORD

245
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,377
WITH THE DIRECTOR TO SAY THAT I

246
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:00,546
WOULD -- I WAS BEING

247
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:01,280
INVESTIGATED, HILLARY CLINTON,

248
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,417
AND THEN THEY PLAYED DOWN

249
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:05,384
"NEW YORK TIMES" INQUIRIES ABOUT

250
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:06,118
THE TRUMP TEAM BEING UNDER

251
00:07:06,118 --> 00:07:07,954
INVESTIGATION FOR RUSSIAN

252
00:07:07,954 --> 00:07:09,622
COLLUSION.

253
00:07:09,622 --> 00:07:11,190
>> Jesse: I DON'T THINK THEY

254
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,593
THOUGHT TRUMP WAS GOING TO WIN.

255
00:07:13,593 --> 00:07:15,127
>> Dana: THE FBI OR HILLARY?

256
00:07:15,127 --> 00:07:16,529
>> Greg: I THINK HILLARY

257
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:17,997
SHOULD BE UPSET THAT THE

258
00:07:17,997 --> 00:07:19,332
GOVERNMENT DIDN'T SEND A SPY

259
00:07:19,332 --> 00:07:21,667
INTO HER CAMPAIGN TO PROTECT

260
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:22,268
THAT IS SEXISM.

261
00:07:22,268 --> 00:07:24,003
>> Dana: TO SAY YOU ARE NOT

262
00:07:24,003 --> 00:07:25,638
GOING TO WIN MICHIGAN.

263
00:07:25,638 --> 00:07:27,306
>> Kimberly: PROTECT HER FROM

264
00:07:27,306 --> 00:07:27,807
HERSELF.

265
00:07:27,807 --> 00:07:29,208
>> Jesse: ACCORDING TO THE

266
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,610
MEDIA, IT WAS NOT A SPY.

267
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:37,984
IT WAS JUST AN INFORMANT.

268
00:07:37,984 --> 00:07:38,784
>> Juan: BECAUSE

269
00:07:38,784 --> 00:07:40,987
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID "EMBEDDED."

270
00:07:40,987 --> 00:07:43,422
THERE WAS NO ONE EMBEDDED IN THE

271
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:43,990
CAMPAIGN.

272
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,191
THIS GUY IS A PROFESSOR

273
00:07:45,191 --> 00:07:46,058
SOMEWHERE IN BRITAIN AND WHAT HE

274
00:07:46,058 --> 00:07:48,794
DID WAS HE CAME INTO CONTACT

275
00:07:48,794 --> 00:07:50,696
WITH THREE OH OFFICIALS, THREE

276
00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:51,797
OF WHOM HAD ALREADY PREVIOUSLY

277
00:07:51,797 --> 00:07:52,832
BEEN IMPLICATED IN TERMS OF

278
00:07:52,832 --> 00:07:55,201
CONNECTIONS TO RUSSIA.

279
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:57,236
>> Jesse: WE HEARD IT WAS

280
00:07:57,236 --> 00:07:57,537
FOUR.

281
00:07:57,537 --> 00:07:57,970
>> Juan: OKAY.

282
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,439
I WILL GO THREE.

283
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,575
CARTER PAGE, GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS

284
00:08:02,575 --> 00:08:03,576
CARTER PAGE, GEORGE PAPADOPOULO

285
00:08:03,576 --> 00:08:04,777
PAPADOPOULOS, AND WHO'S THE

286
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:05,378
OTHER?

287
00:08:05,378 --> 00:08:06,412
>> Jesse: FLYNN AND MANAFORT.

288
00:08:06,412 --> 00:08:09,515
>> Juan: NO, THERE WAS ANOTHER

289
00:08:09,515 --> 00:08:09,982
ONE.

290
00:08:09,982 --> 00:08:11,317
>> Jesse: EITHER WAY, YOU TALK

291
00:08:11,317 --> 00:08:13,986
TO THE CAMPAIGN PEOPLE.

292
00:08:13,986 --> 00:08:15,721
>> Juan: THE POINT IS NOBODY

293
00:08:15,721 --> 00:08:17,523
WAS EMBEDDED AND WHAT YOU HAVE

294
00:08:17,523 --> 00:08:19,225
IS A LEGITIMATE INVESTIGATION OF

295
00:08:19,225 --> 00:08:20,426
THE IDEA THAT RUSSIA IS

296
00:08:20,426 --> 00:08:23,029
INTERFERING IN AN AMERICAN

297
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:24,130
ELECTION AND THEY DON'T LAUNCH,

298
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,232
BY THE WAY, A CRIMINAL

299
00:08:26,232 --> 00:08:27,199
INVESTIGATION.

300
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,301
THEY DO A COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

301
00:08:28,301 --> 00:08:28,801
INVESTIGATION.

302
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:29,835
ALL THEY ARE DOING IS TRYING TO

303
00:08:29,835 --> 00:08:31,604
FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

304
00:08:31,604 --> 00:08:32,837
THE THING THAT CONCERNS ME, AND

305
00:08:32,837 --> 00:08:36,576
I PICKED UP ON THIS, I THINK

306
00:08:36,576 --> 00:08:37,842
IT'S WHAT SALLY YATES WAS

307
00:08:37,842 --> 00:08:38,878
TALKING ABOUT.

308
00:08:38,878 --> 00:08:41,179
WE RELY ON OUR INTELLIGENCE

309
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:43,282
PEOPLE, AND IF YOU START

310
00:08:43,282 --> 00:08:44,183
DOUBTING THEM, THIS COMES FROM

311
00:08:44,183 --> 00:08:47,587
CHRISTOPHER WRAY, YOU DO THAT,

312
00:08:47,587 --> 00:08:49,789
YOU PUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, YOU

313
00:08:49,789 --> 00:08:51,190
PUT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AT GREAT

314
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,225
RISK IF WE CAN'T PROTECT OUR

315
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:53,559
AGENTS.

316
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,727
>> Greg: THEY MADE IT PRETTY

317
00:08:54,727 --> 00:08:56,429
CLEAR WHO HE WAS IN A NUMBER OF

318
00:08:56,429 --> 00:08:57,396
WAYS.

319
00:08:57,396 --> 00:08:58,464
IF THEY REALLY DID CARE, AND

320
00:08:58,464 --> 00:08:59,865
THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN FAIR ABOUT

321
00:08:59,865 --> 00:09:03,035
THIS AND THEY WOULD HAVE DEALT

322
00:09:03,035 --> 00:09:04,203
WITH BOTH CAMPAIGNS.

323
00:09:04,203 --> 00:09:06,105
THEY ARE SAYING NOW OH, THE

324
00:09:06,105 --> 00:09:07,506
RUSSIANS WERE MORE INTERESTED IN

325
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:07,807
TRUMP.

326
00:09:07,807 --> 00:09:09,141
THAT'S CONVENIENT NOW THAT

327
00:09:09,141 --> 00:09:12,478
EVERYBODY FINDS OUT YOU'VE BEEN

328
00:09:12,478 --> 00:09:13,212
PUTTING INFORMANTS.

329
00:09:13,212 --> 00:09:13,980
>> Juan: EVERYBODY HAS SAID,

330
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,184
EVERYBODY FROM THE BIPARTISAN

331
00:09:18,184 --> 00:09:21,420
SENATE COMMITTEE HAS SAID RUSSIA

332
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,822
FAVORED DONALD TRUMP TO WIN.

333
00:09:22,822 --> 00:09:25,558
WE LEARNED THIS WEEKEND, THE

334
00:09:25,558 --> 00:09:26,292
SAUDIS, THE ISRAELIS HAVE ALSO

335
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:27,960
SAID WE HAVE AN INTEREST IN

336
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,795
HELPING YOU OUT, MR. TRUMP.

337
00:09:29,795 --> 00:09:31,030
>> Jesse: I WANT TO KNOW WHAT

338
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,799
THE CHINESE DID WITH HILLARY.

339
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:36,902
>> Greg: JUAN, LET ME ASK YOU

340
00:09:36,902 --> 00:09:37,570
A QUESTION.

341
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,971
>> Juan: OBAMA, CLINTON.

342
00:09:38,971 --> 00:09:44,176
>> Greg: THEY PAY THE GUY

343
00:09:44,176 --> 00:09:44,543
$400,000.

344
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:46,212
>> Jesse: THE WEEK AFTER THE

345
00:09:46,212 --> 00:09:48,314
DNC SERVER WAS ALLEGEDLY HACKED

346
00:09:48,314 --> 00:09:49,582
BY THE RUSSIANS, THEY OPEN UP A

347
00:09:49,582 --> 00:09:51,183
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

348
00:09:51,183 --> 00:09:53,185
INVESTIGATION TO SEE ABOUT

349
00:09:53,185 --> 00:09:54,420
RUSSIAN HACKING.

350
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,821
KIMBERLY, THEY NEVER SEIZED THE

351
00:09:55,821 --> 00:09:56,589
SERVER.

352
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:58,124
THEY NEVER LOOKED AT THE SERVER,

353
00:09:58,124 --> 00:09:59,725
RAN AN INVESTIGATION ON THE

354
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:00,960
SERVER, DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT

355
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,129
-- WOULDN'T YOU THINK THAT WOULD

356
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:04,997
BE THE FIRST THING THEY WOULD

357
00:10:04,997 --> 00:10:05,264
DO?

358
00:10:05,264 --> 00:10:07,800
>> Kimberly: YOU WOULD THINK.

359
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,602
HOW ABOUT TURN OVER THE

360
00:10:09,602 --> 00:10:11,003
PHYSICAL, TANGIBLE EVIDENCE SO

361
00:10:11,003 --> 00:10:13,005
THEY CAN DO A PROPER FORENSICS

362
00:10:13,005 --> 00:10:14,774
EXAMINATION AND SEE IF THEY CAN

363
00:10:14,774 --> 00:10:17,076
RETRIEVE ANY DELETED FILES.

364
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:19,645
IT SHOWS THE HYPOCRISY AND HOW

365
00:10:19,645 --> 00:10:21,180
THE DISINGENUOUS.

366
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,615
WHEN THEY HAVE EVIDENCE OF

367
00:10:22,615 --> 00:10:23,382
ACTUAL MALFEASANCE AND THINGS

368
00:10:23,382 --> 00:10:25,551
GOING ON, THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING

369
00:10:25,551 --> 00:10:26,786
ABOUT IT.

370
00:10:26,786 --> 00:10:28,788
BUT THEN THEY TRIED TO CONJURE

371
00:10:28,788 --> 00:10:29,689
UP LIKE EVIL SPIRITS AN IDEA OF

372
00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:31,590
COLLUSION AND THEN SAY JUST

373
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,426
LOOKING OUT FOR YOU, BUDDY.

374
00:10:33,426 --> 00:10:34,960
THEY PUT SOME ON YOUR CAMPAIGN,

375
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,395
THEY ARE CHANGING THE STORY SAY

376
00:10:36,395 --> 00:10:38,597
NO, WE ARE TRYING TO PROTECT

377

00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,249
WE ARE STILL DEALING WITH THE

00:10:57,249 --> 00:10:59,218
IDEA THAT RUSSIANS ARE TRYING TO

388
00:10:59,218 --> 00:10:59,985
INTERFERE IN THE CAMPAIGN.

389
00:10:59,985 --> 00:11:01,187
WE ARE WAITING TO FIND OUT WHAT

390
00:11:01,187 --> 00:11:01,620
MUELLER HAS.

>> Jesse: THIS WAS A LEAK FROM

395
00:11:11,197 --> 00:11:12,798

AHEAD OF IT.

I WILL TELL YOU WHY THERE IS

401
00:11:18,604 --> 00:11:19,772
SUSPICION, JUAN.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT?

405
00:11:24,176 --> 00:11:26,612
NOW THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS A

406
00:11:26,612 --> 00:11:27,079
POLITICAL TOOL?

407
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:28,013

ADMINISTRATION, AP REPORTERS AND

410
00:11:34,186 --> 00:11:37,022
FOX REPORTERS WERE LOOKED INTO.

411
00:11:37,022 --> 00:11:37,823
CONGRESS WAS SURVEILLED.

412
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:39,792
ALL OF A SUDDEN AND OPPOSING

413
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:40,426
CAMPAIGN IS SURVEILLED AND

414
00:11:40,426 --> 00:11:42,995
EVERYONE IS SAYING OH, YOU KNOW

>> Juan: WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

418
00:11:47,032 --> 00:11:48,267
MUCH TO MY CHAGRIN BECAUSE I
