listen up please time for money power politics PepsiCo announced the departure of CEO Indra Nooyi leaving just 24 women total in the position of CEO at the top publicly traded companies in the sp500 the problem is that number is going down not up a woman has succeeded another woman as chief executive of a publicly traded company only three times in history in fact and you know you've heard this from me before there are more men named James running fortune 500 companies than there are women in total at the helm joining me now my dear friend and founder and CEO of the crew and author have dropped the ball if you haven't read it yet you must Tiffany de feu Tiffany I'm not saying Pepsi you had a woman it must be a woman next but this is so distressing and she's not the only one we just saw Campbell's soup we saw Mondelez female CEO step down and the only company I can even think of as north of Grumman that's elevated a woman so you and I can talk all day long about the power of women yes unfortunately it ain't showing up where it counts well let's start by congratulating Indra Nui and celebrating her she had an incredible run she's a phenomenal leader she took Pepsi from 35 to 60 3.5 billion dollars in it and it's it was a fantastic run particularly for CEO of this day and age and certainly Cathy worden is stepping up and we're excited about that but there's no doubt that we don't have enough women in leadership and the reason why isn't rocket science we've got a pipeline that's decimated at different levels we know from Lehman and Mackenzie's women in the workplace report that women enter the workforce at the same rates that men do but they don't they're not promoted as much as men are by the time we get to the middle so you think about the life cycle of just people and families the average female CEO gets that job at around the age 51 well about 15 years before that is when she needs to be ramping up her career at the same time that people are often having babies procreating right you know and and workplace is really are not still set up to support people who are caregivers so this narrative come from that you hear you know everyone is all about diversity and you go girl and promoting women what about those guys when you actually look at the businesses none of this is true those top executive jobs I'm talking about for you get to the CEO job are not conducive for someone who is co-parenting it's not even an option so if a woman wants to make it to the top she simply has to say I guess I'm not going to have a family or my partner must stay home think about the travel expectations on these executives well that's correct and you know women are not crazy they're looking at that top job they're seeing the demands of that job and they're saying I don't necessarily want to do that that's not the kind of life that I want to leave and can we just give a shout out to Indra knew his husband who has made a lot of this possible he's going to true all in partner to her but I think that goes to our culture and these gender stereotypes around who can do what at home I am here today when I left this morning my husband was feeding my kids breakfast they can do that so this idea that only women can be the primary caregiver is really a part of the issue as well are you distressed in some way any fortune 500 companies most have probably asked you to come talk to them talk to their team give a speech you've given speeches to everybody in their brother every but when you look out into the audience its junior and mid-level staff members for women and those on top continue to be dudes it's completely frustrating and it's also frustrating because we know that 90% of CEOs are pulled from line roles so what you want to talk about women in the c-suite of which there are many they're not in the roles and in the positions that are usually plucked in order to get to that stop spot so we still have to keep working my life's work is advancing women and girls I'm gonna keep going yes it's frustrating is it distressing yes but Indra Nui inspires me shouldn't have as more she inspires me and I'm going to continue the good fight you hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
