I'm going to teach you how to be a human lie detector in two minutes say out loud your mother's maiden name ok now I want you to lie to me tell me the city that you were born in did you notice what happened the second time you spoke it took you just a little longer because your mind wants to immediately tell the truth and when you lie your brain has to suppress the truth before you can create the lie that is the key to lie detection your mind and body is always giving you away so if somebody says to their spouse are you cheating on me well one response is what you think I'm cheating on you how dare you think such a thing that's one two is what no why would you think that I'm so sorry which one do you think is the truth well the first one doesn't even answer the question it's angry more hostile than the question requires plus a person is attacking the second one is softer more concerned a person who is lying tends to be very intense through the whole process they tend to ask questions of you you want to know if I stole that person's report in the office that's gaining time I'm trying to create the lie here so I have to say something in order to see what you know how you know it the bottom line is also is that when your brain is lying there's a bit of an adrenaline rush that's why people who lie may talk faster than normal they're touching their face their blink rate is changing sometimes they stare too much sometimes they tell the story very carefully so I saw that woman and in this place and they're being very formal in their language because they're still working hard they're trying to stay calm and they're saying the story unnaturally that tells you that they're lying so it's very simple when trying to detect a lie think to yourself what do I want to believe that's crucial everybody comes to the table and they want to hear they think the truth now a lot of times you want to hear the lie you want to hear that there's no cheating going on there's no stealing happening in the office so you buy it back up from it and you'll be able to detect if it just doesn't seem right and sound simple then you're being lied to
