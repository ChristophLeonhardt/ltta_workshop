so you argued a bit against I'm sort of the use of identity politics within like a current political climate and I sort of all agree in the sense that like ICS is all being the same I think I've read recently that like you can find more genetic variation within 60 different South African chimpanzees than the entire human race right so we're all the same like I get that and so you know I'll be with you to that extent but statistics indicate for example and I apologize for speaking on a group but I'm not a part of but for example right like that african-american community has not seen the same financial income for example as the white community and we also both know I'm assume you've seen the same statistic saying that you need to have an income of roughly seventy thousand dollars per year to achieve like a certain sort of baseline plateau happiness or whatever so I just don't understand how you can argue against gender or gender public politics but I Dinah politics given the fact that there are very specific groups of people based on their race based on their religion based on the color of their skin that are repressed within a country okay first I don't believe they are repressed in our current country right there what they're experiencing is the effect of bad deeds in history I mean this country you know I don't know if this confuses any worse any more racist I mean I when I lived overseas I was shocked I mean this this country is the least racist country now that I've ever been in but I remember I remember what that was like and and there's no question that that has an effect the theory behind what you're saying okay is that that you can fix the past and that you fix the past by counterbalancing the past so in other words you say well you know white people were miserable - black people and they were you know we we all agree right that that's part of as part of the sad history of this country every country has sad history that's part of ours so now you're going to bend the line back by essentially what taking things from people who never did anything to anybody white people today and giving it to people who did not suffer those things even though they're suffering that historical effect and what what I believe in what I know to be true is that every injustice goes on one side of the scale and it doesn't matter if you mean it to be a injustice to fix things or it's a bad injustice to begin things every injustice goes on the raw on that side of the scale the only way to get rid of this one of the judges I think was Antonin Scalia said the only way to get rid of racial prejudice is to stop
