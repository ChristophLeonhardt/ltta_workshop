<font color="#CCCCCC">living I feel like I'm losing my kid and</font>

00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,410
I know rationally I'm not losing<font color="#E5E5E5"> my kid</font>

38
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:55,090

39
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,670
somehow that distance is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

disconnect you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to where you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font>

41
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,370
to know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to love them you're not</font>

42
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,190
going to know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to how to talk to them</font>

43
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">like it's going to be awkward when you</font>

44
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,370
see them for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Christmas or something and</font>

45
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,130
I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not true rationally but</font>

46
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,040
that's how I feel that's and I just want

47
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a good dad yeah</font>

52
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,230
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a season of really</font>

53
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,580
evaluating what matters like yeah and

54
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,070
simplifying<font color="#CCCCCC"> whether it's physically like</font>

55
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,610
in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> home and purging and just kind of</font>

56
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:53,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">cutting off excess because it affects</font>

57
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,670
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think for us that</font>

58
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,260
commodity<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we feel like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're losing</font>

59
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially with her</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> leaving in five</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">months</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in time</font>

61
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,060
so for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> time looks like we say no to a</font>

62
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of things you know a lot of</font>

63
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:07,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">engagement is for it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just even hanging</font>

64
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">out with people because I think we're</font>

65
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> capitalize on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our time to buck</font>

66
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:16,840
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> right a lot there's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

67
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,120
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could purchase but you</font>

68
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't purchase time yeah I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

71
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,540
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's making us realize like our</font>

72
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,360
time together as husband and wife<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

73
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's like she's teaching us this lesson</font>

74
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,630
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this process is teaching us this</font>

75
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,610
lesson

76
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">you cannot get time back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can't grow</font>

78
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,250
manufacture it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so that's why it's it</font>

79
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">sounds cliche but you literally pick</font>

80
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,560
your head up one day then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

81
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">leaving</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and they're they're gone</font>

82
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,340
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then I feel like if I don't</font>

83
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">capture as much as I can I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>
