Facebook CEO in the hot seat Mark Zuckerberg apologizes to US senators for a massive data breach but avoids questions about how his company might be regulated more closely so what can come out of his testimony and what steps can be taken to ensure better privacy for social media users this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm fully battable after a five hour long testimony before the US Congress on Tuesday Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg managed to walk a fine line as he came under fire from lawmakers he apologized for a range of problems that have beset the social media giant including the lack of data protection but didn't promise to support new regulations Zuckerberg is being questioned by US Congress committee members over two days he's to answer questions on how his company handled data in the wake of a massive users privacy breach we'll get to our guests in just a moment but first Alan Fisher has our report from Washington ditching his favorite gray t-shirts for a suit this was a polished Facebook CEO with a performance to match mark zuckerberg apologized for the massive data breach that impacted 87 million users worldwide we didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility and that was a big mistake and it was my mistake and I'm sorry but the importance of this appearance was not lost on one senator there should be a wake-up call for the tech community we want to hear more without delay about what Facebook and other companies plan to do to take greater responsibility for what happens on their platforms the core issue was summed up with one question from Democrat dick Durbin mr. Zuckerberg would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night no Mark Zuckerberg was called in front of the Senate after it was discovered millions of users data was improperly obtained by uk-based political consultants a Cambridge analytical they used that information to target ads to help Donald Trump's presidential campaign and the brexit referendum in the UK the Facebook founder says steps will be taken to ensure such a data breach can never happen again but one senator asked if he was ready to follow through on that promise I believe you have all the talent my question is whether you have all the will to help us solve this problem yes senator do you believe the European regulations should be applied here in the US regardless of whether we implement the exact same regulation I would guess that it would be somewhat different because we have somewhat different sensibilities perhaps the most contentious exchange came when Republican Ted Cruz accused Facebook of political bias are you aware of any ad or page that has been taken down from Planned Parenthood senator I'm not but let me just move on Network sorry how about moveon.org I'm not specifically aware of those about any Democratic candidate for office I'm not specifically aware I mean I I'm not I'm not sure Mark Zuckerberg revealed Facebook is looking into potential Russian links to the Cambridge analytic a breach and also that the company has cooperated with Special Counsel Robert Mueller who's investigating possible collusion between the Russians and Donald Trump's presidential campaign Mark Zuckerberg spent the weekend preparing for this appearance and it showed he'll no fees members from the US House at a separate hearing on Wednesday with the threat of greater regulation for the entire tech industry standing on the other side of that performance Allen Fisher al Jazeera on Capitol Hill here's a reminder of what the controversy is about on March 17th the New York Times and the UK's Observer newspaper reported that data from Cambridge analytical acquired millions of Facebook users personal information the story was revealed with the help of the co-founder of the uk-based company in now whistleblower Christopher Wylie the data was reportedly sold to Cambridge analytical and used for political purposes linked to the 2016 US presidential election and the Trump campaign Cambridge analytical said the data was destroyed in 2015 but they were reported not all of it was deleted Facebook then confirmed that up to 87 million users details may have been improperly shared with the political consultancy firm now rewind to 2014 when about 270 thousand of the social networks users took an online personality survey via a third-party quiz this gave access not only to their Facebook information but to that of their friends facebook says this violated company policy and he has since tightened up the rules of user consent well let's get the views of our guest now from Palo Alto California joining us by Skype is Larry maggot who's the CEO of connect safely org and internet safety privacy and security organization in London Jennifer pie best lecturer of digital culture and society at King's College London and in New York also by Skype is Jim Anderson CEO of social flow a distribution and monetization platform for publishers thank you all for joining us thank you for your time Larry if I can start with you in the US what do you make of Mark Zuckerberg performance in front of these US lawmakers did he clear the misunderstandings about the Cambridge analytical scandal well first I thought he did a pretty good job keeping his cool but I don't think he cleared a lot of the misunderstandings one of these things that the Senators kept asking over and over again is about selling data and he had to say several times that Facebook doesn't sell data to advertisers instead it salespeople itself users based on certain demographics or interests he also did not I think adequately address exactly why there was such a delay between the time that Facebook found out about this breach with Cambridge analytic and when the public found out about it he did say that they thought they had dealt with it but even then they should have disclosed it so I wasn't happy with that aspect of it and I think the senator some of them are tech savvy but many of them kind of indicated that they really don't understand how Facebook works right it's interesting you say that Jennifer most of the senators who asked Zuckerberg questions didn't seem to have a clue on how Facebook worked or what the solutions to its problems were or even what they were trying to achieve by bringing in Zuckerberg to testify did you learn anything new from his testimony on Tuesday I don't think there's really a lot that we've learned from his testimony maybe in some respects more questions because one of the points that he was making was that there was a delay and the data should have been deleted but why was the data given in the first place and I think this is actually a better starting point in order to understand what is Facebook and at its core it's not just a social networking platform it's a social advertising platform and if we then take another step back and ask well if we're selling people to advertisers what Facebook does is it partners with a whole host of different marketing companies and firms and works with them to take data and interesting cultural facts about their users and provides it with them to help fill out profiles and also takes data from those partners to to learn more about the people that is serving back to others so it's quite a very complicated situation that a lot of people don't fully appreciate or understand Jim you you thought a recent survey by Gallup found that 43% of Americans are very concerned about peer Facebook's invasions of privacy do you think they would have been reassured by what they heard yesterday from Mark Zuckerberg well I don't know about reassured because I don't know who can sit there and watch five hours of testimony I mean it was you know after a while it becomes quite boring and which i think is probably to Facebook's interest I will point out though people very much when you ask them questions about privacy of course we all want our privacy and I thought it was great political theater when the senator asked Mark Zuckerberg if he'd be okay with you know describing what hotel he's staying and of course he wouldn't want that to happen but this is a social network social networks are inherently designed to share information and social sharing of information is almost diametrically opposed to privacy so I think that's the real issue there how do you reconcile the competing preferences and desires of the users and and how does Facebook do that yeah but Jim as Larry said perhaps the only time that Zuckerberg seemed to be under pressure was when he was asked by Senator Kamala Harris to explain why Facebook didn't disclose the Cambridge analytic matter to the public in 2015 and why it waited until it was forced by social by media rather to do so by by that when it was reported by the media if you can explain to us the extent of Facebook's data monitoring and why the company hasn't be more transparent with users on how data is used and how it's been abused why this lack of transparency what are they hiding well I'd say there's a couple of things number one transparency sounds good when you sort of say this new people want transparency most people will say yes but but transparency there's a massive amount of data I mean we're talking terabytes petabytes you know I can't even quantify how much data that would overwhelm anybody's reasonable ability to process it it's also I'm sure Facebook would say it's there's proprietary information in there and not just proprietary to Facebook but proprietary to its users and to his advertisers so you sort of get into this sticky situation where when you say I want transparency and most of us would say that we think that's generally admirable the actual execution of transparency is from quite a number of challenges and I would suspect that Facebook's answers around that you know sort of encompass at least a couple of those points Larry in Palo Alto James seems to say that Facebook shouldn't be taking the blame all the blame anyway for what goes wrong on its platform do you agree with that well I think Facebook has to take responsibility for what goes on in its platform but having said that there are other factors for example the Zuckerberg decision not to disclose its hotel room well I travel a lot and sometimes I decide to disclose my hotel room and sometimes I don't and I have control over that I don't anyway that the public could find out where I was staying via Facebook if I didn't post it so I think that that's not I think it's theatrical if it was it was sort of an unfair question to imply that that has anything to do with Facebook but at the end of the day I think that that Facebook does have responsibilities it created the platform it has to not only build privacy tools it has to make them easily accessible and I think it needs to change some of its defaults I don't think that users should have to read a 40-page manual like I once wrote on Facebook in order to understand their privacy settings it should be simple and the default should pretty much be in favor of privacy until the user decides that they want to disclose more information Jennifer he pushed back Mark Zuckerberg during his testimony on Tuesday pushed back hard against the need for regulation he seemed to deflect all the questions on this why do US lawmakers in the first place need his consent to regulate Facebook and you know when they talk regulation what exactly are they looking at and over what period of time are they talking about regulating I mean I think this is this is a big question that a lot of people should be asking right now and I don't know if anyone actually knows the answer which is part of the problem I think when you begin with the idea of regulation we have to think about the fact that you know Mark Zuckerberg with 2 billion users that's an incredible amount of people an incredible amount of data to be using sharing and adding to the 40 billion US dollars they made in profit from advertising last year so I think step one which was already said is we need to have some kind of accountability in terms of the data that's being used if you're taking my data then I would like to know not just you know how you're using it but who you're selling it to and then what happens to it so that at least I can make some kind of informed informed decision about its use secondly in terms of you know are we going to think about Facebook as as a platform or a publisher because all the other media industries have regulation why are these platforms not being regulated in some kind way Jim do you agree with that can Facebook be regulated either once again Larry let me just get Jim sauce hot sauce on this and I'll get back to you in a second so do you think Facebook can be regulated and when we're talking about regulating regulation what exactly do we want to regulate and to over what time frame are we looking at yeah I think that's the real crux of it I think Facebook is certainly open to they know that some kind of regulation is coming it's question of how much of a light touch I think the most productive conversation is in and around the advertising there have been proposals to make political ads much more transparent who bought them and who did they target you could extend that to all advertising on Facebook or any other technology platform I would suspect the platforms themselves would think that's too far but I think that's a great conversation to have if people are using the platform to pay to deliver messages to certain audiences does the public have a right to know I think that's a fascinating question that will get asked and will be part of the debate probably over the next six 12 18 months right Larry in parallel to your thoughts on this about regulation just coming back to my question why do these US senators lawmakers even need Mark Zuckerburg opinion or consent to introduced regulation over of course they don't need his consent the whole purpose of regulating is for the government to say we are we are in charge and and we get to decide they obviously should get them involved they should hear their side of the story because there going to be some technical issues one of the things the government needs to be careful about is regulating the technology they can set policy but they don't want to set the act on technology but to the issue of publishing from the standpoint of advertising Facebook is like a publisher so like the New York Times for example it can decide what ads it wants to accept but unlike the New York Times it doesn't have full control over editorial The Times could decide or any publisher or Al Jazeera for that matter who they want to bring on is guess who they want to bring on as columnist what articles they want to publish what program they want to broadcast Facebook at the platform if I decide to go on Facebook and say something completely outrageous they can take it down if it violates the Terms of Service but they're not going to pre-approve it and they haven't they haven't decided well Larry Mac is a good guy we're gonna let him on the platform because we think he has important things to say no I just signed up like the other two billion people so I think it's important that we recognize that it's a platform where anybody can say within some limitations anything they want and that does differ from a television station or a newspaper okay Jennifer your thoughts on regulation and also coming back to the European model they're talking about introducing the GDP are in the EU very soon I imagine that will be an interesting test for the u.s. do you think the type of regulation that exists right now in Europe could work in America that's a big question I mean they're really different they're really different places so I'm not entirely sure and able to comment on that right I know from a European perspective I think privacy is much more of an issue that's on the table especially with what's happening with you right now so maybe because of that there's some possibilities around stronger regulation but I think you know as I said before I think one of the starting places is to come back to the way in which this data is is being used and I think that we need to have a much bigger discussion so for example when the Republicans went to Facebook and say look we want to make ads for our campaign Facebook said great we have a whole bunch of different tools that we can use to help you we can use a tool that helps you pair names that you already have with members and are in our database we have a tool that allows you to find people that we've we already have that will find similar people and then we can also tap on our third party members and ask them what data they have so you can learn even more about the people that you already have right so there's there's a lot of sharing that's going on that we need to start by understanding and then from here have a bigger discussion around what does privacy mean and and what does that mean for the user Jim the very business model of Facebook is to make money by selling online ads based on what it learns about it its users on its platform some would say this is a flawed business model so could the answer be in Facebook changing this business model do you see that happening I don't see that happening at all it currently clearly could be if people thought that that was the case but Facebook is just one of many advertising supported businesses just look at the the television broadcast model or the cable television model in the United States it's based in large part on advertising as well and so there's a long history of ad supported businesses Facebook is one of the most successful and profitable companies in the world right now yes they could change but I don't see that happening and in most any realistic scenario they've said they were going about cable gone re no comment about cable news when I watch cable news I have to sit through advertising for medical devices and I hopefully will never be in the market for when I go on Facebook the ads I see are actually products that I'm interested in now I'm not justifying necessarily collecting data about me but one of the benefits of that if you do get more relevant ads and Facebook obviously takes advantage of that but it turns out that customers consumers actually prefer that right but but Larry our facebook says they've been making fixes lately since this controversy began in the last few months actually they've been making quite a lot of fixes but these seem to be happening very quickly are they thinking this through I mean in a few months or a few years are we not going to be hearing about another scandal relating to these fixes well having been a facebook observer and members of the Safety Advisory Board for more than a decade now I can tell you that they've been through this rodeo many times before in fact in 2010 at a press event I asked Mark Zuckerberg why he felt comfortable trusting third-party apps I said you know they're gonna be thousands of these developers how do you know that all of them are gonna be honest and are gonna be fair and trade data correctly and he didn't have a good answer for that it took him eight years to figure out the answer but only after the Cambridge analytical Fiasco so yes they are making changes some of these have been in the works but others are I think precipitated by the crisis and that's not a good way to manage a company but I think it's necessary given the situation they're in what impacts Jennifer do you see the scandal having on facebook or has had on Facebook already I mean I think the biggest impact from the public's perspective is the question of trust how do you how do we trust this this this social media platform where there's been such a huge breach in terms of personal data but maybe other question maybe there's also a ripple effect that's happening as well because on the one hand this is unique this is a unique crisis to Facebook on the other hand the terms and conditions that led to this breach are pretty much identical for all social media platforms whether you're on Instagram also owned by Facebook whatsapp snapchat etc so they usually newsy notion is asking bigger questions are they are they losing users as a result of this I mean Facebook has been losing users now for quite some time especially young young people they don't want to be on Facebook mostly because all their parents are there they don't want to be on a lame platform where their parents are there growing in terms of forty to fifty five year olds but you know because does that mean they can keep renewing themselves I think that's that's a question I think that's also a question that Mark Zuckerberg fears as well which is why he keeps reinventing himself it's the reason why he bought Instagram is also the why the reason that he bought what's that right gym in New York you know do you think Facebook can recover from this scandal will Facebook's business model be dented from you know in terms of advertising from this candle and in terms of what people publish from now on or can they recover from this I think they will recover and it can recover you know really your question you know what will happen after this I mean a lot of it depends on what Facebook does I mean they certainly are vulnerable to continued outrageous scandals you know regulation all of those types of things could affect their business I suspect we're talking about more 5 and 10-year impacts on their business than anytime soon you know you talked about the number of users and are they losing users well they've got more the 2 billion people on the planet using Facebook I don't know a business on earth that wouldn't want two billion customers so they've got an incredible position of strength and while they may very well suffer of some losses because that's just inevitable at some point they've got a large large base from which to work from and I think they'll be fine for the foreseeable future Larry do you agree with Jim he says Facebook where we cover Facebook will recover from this scandal and perhaps if you could tell us what you expect this testimony from Mark Zuckerberg to deliver I mean could we see any outcome any positive outcome from this testimony because Facebook still has a room to grow globally in the developing world and they are investing in bringing the Internet to places where it doesn't exist so they do have some growth potential globally I think young people in America at least in Western Europe are moving to other platforms including their own Instagram in terms of its testimony I don't know I think it's gonna probably just placate Congress Congress is also dealing with many other issues we may be on the verge of military action in Syria we've got the president making news every day regarding the Russian investigation etc so I think they're just going to move on and Mark Zuckerberg will come back to Menlo Park California and will resume business and they're going to things will just go on I mean hopefully they've learned some lessons and they're not going to repeat the same mistakes but inevitably they'll make some new mistakes as they always do give this is a fast moving company all right Jennifer in London you have the last word do you see the scandal this Cambridge analytic a scandal and Facebook changing the way other social media platforms operate I don't know if they're necessarily change the way but I think there'll be a lot more careful in how they operate I think that Facebook is unique because they they branched out maybe too soon because they have their facebook elections site where political parties can go to them and seek and seek help so I think that they kind of put themselves in a vulnerable position like that exposing themselves to the technologies that they've been using for the last ten years for advertising and now how they're being used for politicians what about a regulation do you think regulation wouldn't will negatively impact Facebook and the way people view it I think that regulation maybe is a positive way of impacting these platforms for for the user but in terms of Facebook and their agenda to make money for and sell advertising that's a problem for them so we'll see how that gets negotiated because I think that Mark Zuckerberg has carefully tap-dance around this issue for a very good reason and that's because he knows full well that if it gets regulated it's going to parked on his bottom line okay thank you all
