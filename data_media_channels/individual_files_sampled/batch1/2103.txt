ugly wife is a treasure at home where did you come up with that title it's actually a saying it's an idiom in the Chinese language it comes from a very old folktale one of the men I intrude for my book was the first person to mention this saying to me when a young man is dating and looking for a girlfriend he wants a beautiful woman someone attractive you know when he takes her out his friends will notice and think that he has a very high status but when it comes time for a common man to marry these were his words and he just meant someone who isn't very wealthy his thinking will be very different he'll look for a woman who will take care of children care for his parents cook the food it's not very important at that point that she be a physically attractive person the concept of a wife and of a family and of what marriage should mean it's not really a sexualized concept or even a sentimentalized concept it's sort of a functional like we have a family to take care of we want to continue the family line we want to raise the next generation well we want to do it as a team but this she doesn't need to be like a beauty queen a beautiful woman is kind of a higher-risk in a marriage she might want to spend more money on clothing or cosmetics she might run away with someone who gets attracted to her and kind of Woo's her and so she's considered a less stable choice for like an enduring family life if you're not married by age 27 and you're a woman you are called shownu which means leftover woman and it's the same word they would use for like taking leftovers home from a restaurant it basically means you have expired you are off the shelf it creates a lot of pressure to marry by age 25 only 20% of Chinese women are still single after age 25 and men also believe it too one survey in China showed that 92% of men agrees that by age 27 a woman was a leftover so that's kind of how they're thinking about it
