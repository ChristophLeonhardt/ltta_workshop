1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:06,990
once a lush island covered in rolling
green hills and pristine beaches now a

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:13,440
battered wasteland whipped by the
ferocious power event on the ground

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,080
trees have been shaken naked to their
bomb power lines have been toppled and

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:26,490
homes are left teetering on the edge of
this land now stripped bare Smith was

5
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:34,020
one of the lucky one saved yes we've
been out of here their next-door

6
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,660
neighbor's house a reminder of what
could have been completely destroyed and

7
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,570
that's kind of the way the one above us
is also you can see the the refrigerator

8
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,640
is in the living room the sliders last
door in this kitchen despite the

9
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,140
changing scenery and the destruction in
every corner Steve Smith isn't budging

10
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:02,039
this is iron perseverance he used to be
a little bit better there's just less

11
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:12,330
greenery and the destruction I'm seeing
is is horrible but yeah I'm not leaving

12
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:18,180
the reality may not sustain this
optimism here there's no water power and

13
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:24,140
selling the service the only signal this
building in the entire island

14
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,340
by the dock volunteers delivering
supplies are the only connection to the

15
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:33,400
outside world
there were also their first helping hand

16
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:39,230
arriving on shore days after Hurricane
Irma hit with water perishable goods and

17
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:46,640
food a resident of st. John is stained
but for now it's hard I mean a lot of

18
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,330
families have been here for generations
and this is their whole their whole

19
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:54,080
world so if you leave you know the
question is where do you go and and not

20
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,600
knowing what you're gonna come back to
is also a big concern a catch-22 only

21
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,340
further exacerbated by looting and
lawlessness but according to locals has

22
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,209
eased somewhat since the Navy and the
Coast Guard have been patrolling these

23
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:13,430
streets a much-needed presence for an
island that has always feared being

24
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,150
forgotten
he's a Suarez CNN st. John in the US

25
00:02:17,150 --> 00:00:00,000
Virgin Islands
