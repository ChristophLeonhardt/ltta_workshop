Ahmed says he never carried arms against the Syrian government but some of his family members belonged to the file on Rahman a rebel faction that's one of the reasons why he left his home in eastern Utah as part of the surrender deal reached with the pro-government alliance the other reason is his opposition to reconciling with the government that has killed so many people Rafaela watershed Mahalo every family in eastern Utah lost a family member I lost a lot of friends I lost a colleague who was among 26 who died in the famous car but no airstrike I lost two children that I was teaching at school we decided to move away from this brutal regime and now lives in a mosque here is among some 18,000 people who have been displaced from what was once the rebel controlled enclaves in the suburbs of Damascus many of those deported to ed Lib and opposition controlled province in the northwest are fighters Abu Ahmed is one of them the rebels controlled Eastern hooda since late 2012 but months later it was besieged by government forces it's sad that we lost this battle after seven years of remaining steadfast after so many sacrifices we had to surrender because of the civilians they killed many children the hospitals were out of service anyone injured would die slowly camps are being set up for Syria's newly displaced the refugee camps in Eid Lib are overstretched this is a province with a population of 1 million displaced people and local communities are struggling to cope when rebels are defeated they go to ed Lib those who don't want to live under the rule of President Bashar al-assad also moved to Italy but there is nowhere safe in that province airstrikes continue to hit non-military targets such as schools and health facilities the rebels arrived with their light weapons it's not clear if they will join the ranks of the armed factions in Eid Lib where there has been rebel infighting we fought the Assad regime for seven years with no food no water no medicine until the regime and the Russians launched a barbaric campaign we promised the Assad regime that we will return we will liberate the area there are those who refuse to admit defeat but the loss of Eastern huhta is the worst setback for the opposition since it was forced to surrender the eastern part of aleppo city in 2016 after a similar military campaign is anahulu al jazeera Beirut
