ALL RIGHT. AS IF WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO ARGUE ABOUT, THE DEBATE OVER IMMIGRATION CONTINUES TO RAGE. THE QUESTION OF THE BORDERS IS IN THE SPOTLIGHT. THE AUTHOR OF MELTING POT FOR CIVIL WAR, THE SON OF IMMIGRANT MAKES THE CASE AGAINST OPEN BORDERS. TELL US QUICKLY THE ARGUMENT YOU ARE SETTING OUT IN THIS BOOK. THE BASIC ARGUMENT IS THAT WE HAVE ABANDONED THE IDEAL OF WE'VE I THE MELTING POT. WE'VE ABANDON THE IDEAL THAT WHAT WE NEED IS THE UNIFYING NATIONALISM THAT CAN CREATE A COMMON CULTURE. INSTEAD WE HAVE IMMIGRATION POLICIES THAT ARE EXACERBATING OUR DIVIDE. THE IDEA THAT WE MIGHT FIND YOURSELF IN A CIVIL WAR FEELS MORE REAL THAN EVER. THIS WEEK IN PARTICULAR. WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS OFFER A POSITIVE POPULIST PROGRAM OF THE KIND THAT YOUR VIEWERS WOULD APPRECIATE THAT'S ABOUT HOW WE CAN OVERCOME THOSE DIVIDES AND BUILD A NEW AMERICA THAT IS RICHER, STRONGER, FAIR AND THAT REALLY WORKS FOR ALL AMERICANS REGARDLESS OF CLASS OR ETHNIC BACKGROUND. SOTELO SOME OF THE SPECIFICS IN TERMS OF A POTENTIAL PLAN TO DELIVER THAT PROMISE. THE HEART OF THE IDEA IS THAT RIGHT NOW OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM DOES NOT REALLY SERVE OUR NATIONAL INTEREST. THAT'S ONE REASON WHY THERE'S SO MUCH RESENTMENT. IT'S NOT CONTROLLED. PEOPLE DON'T FEEL LIKE IT'S SPEAKING TO THEIR INTERESTS. THE HEART OF THE IDEA IS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE AN IMMIGRATION POLICY IN WHICH WE SELECT IMMIGRANTS ON HOW THEY CAN HELP US OVERCOME ALL THE OBSTACLES WE FACE TOWARD BUILDING A BETTER, FAIRER SOCIETY. THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO HAVE A MORE SELECTIVE APPROACH BUT WE MIGHT ALSO NEED SOME KIND OF AMNESTY OR PATH TO LEGAL STATUS PROVIDED WE HAVE TRUE CONTROL OVER WHO COMES IN AND WHO LEAVES THIS COUNTRY. SOME OF THAT, PEOPLE WILL CHEER AND SAY YES, PROPER MERIT-BASED IMMIGRATION. THE OTHER PART OF IT, THE LEGALIZATION, PEOPLE WILL SAY FINE BUT IT NEVER HAPPENS AND YOU NEVER GET THE BORDER SECURITY COMPONENT. WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT CRITICISM? WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN BIPARTISAN IMMIGRATION DEALS IN THE PAST, THEY HAVEN'T BEEN TRULY BIPARTISAN. THEY HAVE BEEN FAKE BIPARTISAN. THEY'VE BEEN AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO WANT CHEAP LABOR AND GUESTWORKERS AND PEOPLE WHO WANT AMNESTY, RATHER THAN THOSE WHO WANT TO DEAL WITH FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE COUNTRY FOR A LONG TIME UNLAWFULLY WITH THOSE WHO WANT CONTROL AND WANT TO NATIONAL INTEREST IMMIGRATION POLICY. THAT'S WHY I OFFER A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL SAYING YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY KIND OF PATHWAY UNLESS IT'S DONE IN CONCERT WITH A TRUE NATIONAL INTEREST IMMIGRATION POLICY THAT ALLOWS US TO ACTUALLY HAVE THE KIND OF INTERMARRIAGE AND INTERMINGLING THAT CREATED THE MELTING POT MAJORITY THAT MADE THIS COUNTRY GREAT IN THE DECADES FOLLOWING THE SECOND WORLD WAR. IT WAS SO ESSENTIAL TO MAKE US THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. I'M SORRY, I NEED TO MAKE SURE RICHARD CAN GET IN. CAN YOU SEE DEMOCRATS GETTING BEHIND THE. I THINK DEMOCRATS CAN GET BEHIND THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE TO FIND A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP FOR THE 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED THAT ARE HERE AND WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN PART OF OUR ECONOMY. WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT, THEY TAKE CARE OF OUR KIDS AND CLEAN OUR HOME, THEY WORK ON CONSTRUCTION SITES MR LARGO, OVER AND OVER AGAIN THEY WANT NOTHING BUT THE AMERICAN DREAM. WITH THAT BEING SAID WE DO HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE SURE THERE IS SOME LEVEL OF SECURITY ON THE BORDER. I'M NOT SAYING A WALL IS THE ANSWER BUT WE SAW PRESIDENT OBAMA DOUBLE THE SPENDING ON THE BORDER AND DOUBLE THE BORDER PATROL. JUST A QUICK QUESTION. , THE POINT IS, DEALING WITH THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE HERE, THE POINT IS WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THIS PROBLEM DOESN'T GET FURTHER EXACERBATE EXASPERATED.
