1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,299
USA TODAY CONDUCTED A SURVEY
FEATURING LAWMAKERS --

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:07,680
REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS -- IN THE
MAIN QUESTION WAS WHETHER OR NOT

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,150
THEY SUPPORT INCREASED FUNDING
TO BUILD TRUMP'S BORDER WALL.

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:17,540
NOW WHILE TRUMP WAS CAMPAIGNING
THERE WERE MANY REPUBLICANS WHO

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,720
STOOD BY HIM ON THAT VERY ISSUE,
AND NOW IT TURNS OUT THAT THE

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,750
MAJORITY OF THE GOP IS NOT IN
FAVOR OF SPENDING TAXPAYER MONEY

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,150
TO CONSTRUCT THE WALL.

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:01:06,610
LET ME
GIVE YOU 

9
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:07,780
THE DETAILS --

10
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,860
I FIND THIS SURVEY SO
INTERESTING.

11
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,920
BY THE WAY, THERE

12
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,560
WERE SOME LAWMAKERS WHO REFUSED
TO ANSWER OR JUST DIDN'T TAKE

13
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,460
PART IN THE SURVEY, THREE
REPUBLICANS SAID THEY OPPOSED

14
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,050
THE MONEY, SEVERAL EVADED A
DIRECT ANSWER, AND THE REST

15
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,580
SIMPLY REFUSED TO RESPOND TO THE
QUESTION.

16
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,470
AGAIN, A PRETTY SMALL

17
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:32,460
NUMBER OF LAWMAKERS BEHIND
FUNDING THIS BORDER WALL.

18
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,260
ANYTHING TO GET A REPUBLICAN
TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

19
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,260
WE WILL SAY

20
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,470
ANYTHING, AGREE WITH ANYTHING,
TACITLY SUPPORT ANYTHING HE'S

21
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,040
SAYING HE IS RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT.

22
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,040
BUT ONCE IT GETS

23
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,040
THERE IT'S DIFFERENT.

24
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,390
AND WILL
HURD FROM TEXAS, FROM A

25
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:54,450
DISTRICT MADE UP OF A LOT OF
HISPANIC AMERICANS, HE'S SOMEONE

26
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,920
WHO IS EYEING LEADERSHIP,
SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO A) WIN

27
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,770
REELECTION BUT B)

28
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:03,320
MOVE UP IN THE
HOUSE, HE SEES THIS -- STEVE

29
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,530
PEARCE FROM NEW MEXICO, THESE
ARE BORDER STATES, AND JEFF

30
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,090
FLAKE, OF COURSE, WHO IS NO FAN
OF THE PRESIDENT'S TO BEGIN

31
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,090
WITH.

32
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,799
SO HEARING THESE VOICES, I
THINK INSIGHT IS WHAT WE

33
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:18,520
BELIEVE, THAT NOBODY REALLY
BELIEVED THIS WAS A GREAT PIECE

34
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,030
OF POLICY.

35
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,609
TRUMP'S BASE DID.

36
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:25,969
THE REPUBLICANS WHO WENT
ALONG, THE DYED IN THE WOOL

37
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:29,550
REPUBLICANS WENT ALONG WITH HIM,
THE POLITICAL VETERANS WHO WENT

38
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:34,099
ALONG WITH HIM, YOU NEVER
BELIEVE THEY REALLY BELIEVED IN

39
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:36,939
HIM, THEY JUST DIDN'T WANT --
THEY WANTED A REPUBLICAN IN THE

40
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:39,570
WHITE HOUSE AT ALL COSTS, AND
THAT'S WHAT THEY GOT.

41
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,629
THAT'S WHAT THEY GOT.

42
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:43,880
SORT
OF.

43
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,219
SORT OF, RIGHT.

44
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:49,069
I DON'T EVEN THINK TRUMP HAS A
REAL IDEOLOGY.

45
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,069
I THINK HE GOES

46
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,989
BACK AND FORTH AND JUST IS THAT
WILDCARD THAT WE EXPECTED HIM TO

47
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:54,989
BE.

48
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:56,980
HE'S INCREDIBLY
UNPREDICTABLE.

49
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,489
AND SWITCHING

50
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:03,519
GEARS FOR ONE SECOND TO MAKE MY
POINT, A LOT OF REPUBLICANS

51
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,299
STOOD BEHIND HIM BECAUSE THEY
BELIEVE IN PARTY POLITICS.

52
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:08,299
THAT

53
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:09,510
IS THE PRIORITY, RIGHT?

54
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,260
AND NOW
THERE ARE PEOPLE BEING

55
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,670
IMPLICATED IN THIS RUSSIA
INVESTIGATION, THEY ARE

56
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,670
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.

57
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,290
BUT HERE'S
THE THING, IF YOU ARE GOING TO

58
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,870
PUT YOUR NAME BEHIND A
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, IF YOU

59
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,999
ARE GOING TO TAKE A POSITION AS
A WHITE HOUSE STAFFER, AND YOU

60
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:28,370
KNOW THIS INDIVIDUAL IS SHADY,
THAT YOU WILL BE INVOLVED IN

61
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,370
SHADY DEALINGS.

62
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,599
YOU MIGHT GET
INVESTIGATED.

63
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,970
IF TRUMP MADE SOME

64
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,389
SORT OF FINANCIAL DEAL WITH THE
RUSSIANS, AND THE SPECIAL

65
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:38,640
COUNSEL OR THE PENTAGON WANTS TO
DO AN INVESTIGATION TO FIND OUT

66
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,349
WHAT'S GOING ON, WHETHER THERE
WAS COLLUSION OR OBSTRUCTION OF

67
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:46,769
JUSTICE, THERE ARE THINGS IN
LIFE THAT ARE MORE IMPORTANT

68
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:49,060
THAN YOUR POLITICAL IDENTITY.

69
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,079
AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS, WHAT

70
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,549
ARE YOUR PRINCIPLES?

71
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:54,750
IF YOUR
PRINCIPAL IS I'M JUST GOING TO

72
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,400
SUPPORT EVERY REPUBLICAN NO
MATTER WHAT, THEN YOU DON'T

73
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,910
REALLY STAND FOR ANYTHING.

74
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:03,439
YOU
HAVE TO STAND FOR ACTUAL IDEAS

75
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,010
AND STICK BY THAT.

76
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,330
AND IF
LAWMAKERS ABANDON YOU WHEN IT

77
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,930
COMES TO THOSE IDEAS THEN YOU
SHOULDN'T CONTINUE SUPPORTING

78
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:10,930
THEM.

79
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:15,620
YOU ARE 1000% RIGHT, AND THAT
IS WHAT IS LACKING IN THIS

80
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,048
COUNTRY, AND IN MOST COUNTRIES
TOO I THINK.

81
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:19,078
IF YOU PICK A PATH,

82
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,269
YOU GO DOWN THAT PATH.

83
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,520
BUT THESE
PEOPLE SUPPORTED DOLL TRUMP

84
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,900
BECAUSE OF NEIL GORSUCH, BECAUSE
OF OBAMACARE REPEAL.

85
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,250
THAT LITTLE

86
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,630
SILLY THING ABOUT THE WALL AND
THESE THINGS HE SAID ABOUT

87
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,669
WOMEN, FORGET THAT, WE WILL GET
NEIL GORSUCH ON THE SUPREME

88
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:41,330
COURT AND THEN WE WILL GET WHAT
WE WANT IN TERMS OF SOCIAL

89
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,080
CONSERVATISM.

90
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,190
THERE IS HYPOCRISY THERE.

91
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,320
EVERYONE HAS TO SWALLOW A LITTLE
HYPOCRISY WHEN YOU VOTE FOR

92
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,550
SOMEONE FOR PRESIDENT.

93
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,830
YOU VOTED FOR HILLARY CLINTON
FOR PRESIDENT, YOU WEREN'T

94
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,289
WILD ABOUT HER.

95
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:54,539
NOT AT ALL.

96
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:57,280
BUT THE RNC FOR ME
WAS A HUGE WAKE-UP CALL.

97
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,460
WHAT I'M SAYING IS AT ANYTIME,
IF I'M WILD ABOUT THE CANDIDATE,

98
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,849
IF I CAN'T WAIT TO VOTE FOR
HILLARY CLINTON, THERE ARE

99
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:08,310
MISGIVINGS ALL THE TIME,
EVERYONE I VOTED FOR.

100
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,509
I KNOW THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS A PERFECT CANDIDATE, BUT

101
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:15,879
TRUMP WAS NEVER SPECIFIC ABOUT
ANYTHING.

102
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:17,800
OKAY, HE WAS SPECIFIC

103
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,340
ABOUT BUILDING A BORDER WALL AND
HAVING MEXICO PAY FOR IT.

104
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,340
BUT

105
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,530
WHEN IT CAME TO THE
NITTY-GRITTY, THE DETAILS OF HOW

106
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,770
HE WOULD GET MEXICO TO PAY FOR
IT HE NEVER HAD AN ANSWER.

107
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,970
AND NO REPUBLICAN REALLY HELD
HIS FEET TO THE FIRE WHEN

108
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:31,970
IT CAME TO THOSE THINGS.

109
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,550
TOTALLY TRUE.

110
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,490
ALTHOUGH YOU
COULD ARGUE THAT 16 OF THEM DID

111
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,840
DURING THE CAMPAIGN, AND THAT
WENT NOWHERE, AND AT A CERTAIN

112
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,580
POINT, WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

113
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,520
BUT
YOU ARE RIGHT IN THEORY.

114
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,520
NOBODY

115
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,270
COULD PENETRATE, IRONICALLY, THE
WALL OF TRUMP.

116
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,270
AND THAT'S WHAT

117
00:05:50,270 --> 00:00:00,000
HAPPENED THIS LAST TIME OUT.
