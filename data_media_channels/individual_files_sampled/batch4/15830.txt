are any of you rebels out there into online dating I would imagine that there are many of you who are it's a common way of meeting new people and possibly new partners these days and as my grandmother would say every date a potential mate which sounds kind of creepy in today's context but I think what she was trying to say is there is no point in going on a date with someone or dating someone that you can't see spending the rest of your life with but online dating no longer has the stigma that it did ten years ago which is great because a lot of people we have such busy lives you do I'm sure you just barely squeezed in enough time every day to make sure you see my videos but most people don't really have a chance to go out and meet people for the express purpose of dating so maybe you're on matcom or a harmonie or something like that or maybe you are a closeted freak show maybe you're on gluten-free singles con equestrian cupid calm clown dating calm hot sauce patience calm amish online dating calm meat and inmate calm Darwin dating calm mullet patience calm diaper meat calm that's for adults who like to dress like babies women behind bars calm singles with food allergies calm or the ugly bald calm that last one advertises as a website for aesthetically average people and those are all real websites by the way so if any of those sound appealing to you have at it now I am NOT here to judge anybody on their dating preferences we all like weird things but how would you like for Facebook with all of their problems with data breaches and privacy issues how would you like for them to have access to all of your dirty little juicy details of your love life they might someday soon more about that in a minute but I am personally grateful that I am NOT in the dating game I removed myself from the market before bubble and tender and Grindr all that stuff picked up steam and I gotta tell you watching people swipe left and right is enough to send me into a deep state of anxiety but if you're looking for an online dating site I've got to say anything is better than Facebook even meet an inmate calm at least if you ever land in the slammer you'll have a friendly face and someone with an established prison reputation to protect you from getting shanked but at Facebook's annual summit they announced the launch of a new dating app within the social media app it's been in development for years but we'll move into the beta testing phase in just a few months the announcement of Facebook's newest iteration their dating platform sent the stock of match group which owns tinder OkCupid and match.com down 22% yeah I know something else that would go down at the combined thought of Zuckerberg and dating so are you still creeped out by Facebook what do you think are you willing to dip your toes in the water and as a quick little aside Facebook also had other issues on to use me on Tuesday with a glitch in their system certain users on the platform as they were trying to post to their timeline received a prompt asking if their posts contained any hate speech Facebook claims that it was a bug and was fixed shortly thereafter but it does make you wonder if they were just trying something out to see what the reception would be either way Facebook hate speech is also protected under the First Amendment not just liberal blabber that you happen to agree with and just a little PSA for you always remember to clear your browser history and cache memory you don't want Facebook digging up your cookies no matter how sweet you think they are thanks so much for watching everybody I'm Amanda head for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and opinions we have an unlimited supply of them over here at the rebel so subscribe to our premium content at www.stanford.edu on the App Store that way you will have easy and immediate access to all of our latest videos and your favorite rebel shows thanks so much for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel
