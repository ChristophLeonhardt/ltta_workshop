00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,880
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,040
please welcome your host
for tonight, Sofie Hagen.

3
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,280
CHEERING

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,080
Thank you. Thank you very much.

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,040
Hello and welcome to
BBC Ouch Storytelling Live.

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,440
CHEERING

7
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,760
The stories we're
going to be hearing tonight

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,560
are about love and relationships

9
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,320
and I do have a very
long lasting relationship

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,120
with my psychologist.

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,000
Am I right, BBC Ouch people?

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,160
High five. High five.

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,840
I've seen my psychologist
for ten years now. Ten years.

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,080
She's incredible.

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,440
But she's always trying to
help me get out of, you know,

16
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,280
all my mental health issues,
and there's quite a few.

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,760
We have depression, we have anxiety

18
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,920
and binge eating disorder,
which is the cool one.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,400
I don't know if you know about that.

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,560
It's where you eat
so you can't feel anything. Right?

21
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,480
Cos there's a lot of pain inside
because, you know,

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,080
you can feel the bones
if you just swallow them and...

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,800
So there's a lot of pain
right in my throat...

24
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,520
after a good piece of chicken.

25
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,320
My psychologist is amazing. She's
a very, very good psychologist,

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,600
an incredible psychologist.

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,920
For those of you
who can't see me, I'm fat...

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,320
and that's not a bad thing.
That's not a bad thing.

29
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,920
I like being fat. I love my body.

30
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,480
I think everyone should...

31
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,840
love my body cos...
CHEERING

32
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,080
Yeah! Why wouldn't you?

33
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,480
But that means sometimes people give
me advice on how to lose weight.

34
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,240
People would be like, "Oh,
you should stop eating sugar,"

35
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,240
and I'm like, "I can't stop eating
sugar cos then I'll feel...

36
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,000
"I'll feel."

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,480
And that's the reason I eat
is to not feel all the feelings.

38
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,720
I have depression and anxiety.
I don't want to feel my feelings.

39
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,440
My psychologist once
tried to fix it.

40
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,200
She went... We were trying to deal
with some of the feelings that

41
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,160
I don't know how to show.
For example, anger.

42
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,240
I'm very bad with anger.

43
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,440
I don't know how to express anger

44
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,240
so when I do express anger,

45
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,320
it kind of explodes, right?

46
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,160
So she tried to fix that,
so she said to me, "You know,

47
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,880
"next time, next time you feel
angry, just try and express it."

48
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,480
I said, "Oh, no.

49
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,600
"No, I don't think that's...
I don't think that's ...

50
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,240
"There's not enough food
in the world for me to feel angry.

51
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,400
"I'm sorry,
that's not going to happen."

52
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,120
And she said,
"Listen, this is what you do.

53
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,040
"Next time you feel angry, you just
say the words, 'I am angry.' "

54
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,840
I said, "OK, this is on you."

55
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,400
I went from that session, I was very
pleased with what I was about to do.

56
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,360
I was like, "OK, I'm going to go
out and I'm going to actually try

57
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,320
"and feel my anger and
I'm going to try and express it."

58
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,800
And I was practising the sentence,
"I am angry. I am angry,"

59
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,600
for the next times that could
happen, I could say that out loud.

60
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,920
And I met with my friend, my best
friend. Her name is Ina.

61
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,000
Ina's beautiful. Ina's
a very optimistic, happy person.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,160
She's always smiling.
Just the most...

63
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,240
She believes in things like love...
LAUGHTER

64
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,960
What an idiot, right?

65
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,640
And she met me at the station
and I hugged her and she said,

66
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,520
"Oh, my God.
I'm so happy to see you."

67
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,880
I said, "I'm so happy to see you."

68
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,520
She said, "Want to go for dinner?"

69
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,200
I said, "Yeah, I'd love
to go for dinner."

70
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,680
"What do you feel like eating?"

71
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,480
"Oh, I don't know.
I feel like having pasta."

72
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,400
She said,
"Oh, I feel like having Greek food."

73
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,840
And then I punched her in the face.

74
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,440
I punched her in the face.

75
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,680
I saw this happen in slow motion.

76
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,520
I was like, "Oh, no!"

77
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,680
I could just see, and my fist was
like, "We're expressing feelings!"

78
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,200
and my heart was like,
"Don't do it!

79
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,640
"This is what we were afraid of!"

80
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,160
And I saw my fist just hit
her stupid, smiling face.

81
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,320
She never once stopped smiling.

82
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,040
She was just like,
"OK, we'll have pasta.

83
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,840
"I think you're too passionate
about this." I felt so bad.

84
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,840
I didn't know what to do.
I'd hit my friend.

85
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,360
I don't want to be the kind of
person to hit a friend

86
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,480
and I felt so bad

87
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,880
and she was just looking at me
with her big, blue eyes

88
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,200
and I didn't know what to say

89
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,040
so I just went, "I am angry."

90
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,760
And I stopped feeling feelings
for the rest of my life.

91
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,240
That's somewhat of a fairytale.

92
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,120
I would love to introduce you
to the first person on this stage.

93
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,000
Are you up for being very,
very nice?

94
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,320
CHEERING
Or course you are!

95
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,920
Please give it up for your first
person of the night,

96
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,480
it is Ruby MacKellar!

97
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,560
Everybody's already
taken all the good disabilities,

98
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,200
so I got left with dyspraxia.

99
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,960
It's a developmental
coordination disorder.

100
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,800
It's the sort of less sexy
cousin of dyslexia,

101
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,560
which you'll have heard about.

102
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,440
So it largely affects motor control
and speech and memory

103
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,320
and information processing.

104
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,760
What generally happens
is that I fall over a lot

105
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,880
and I cock everything up,
so this is a warning.

106
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,320
Watch this space.

107
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,440
So, I love living alone,
because people,

108
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,360
and so my favourite
activity is sitting alone

109
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,760
on the sofa in my pants
watching telly.

110
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,880
All about that.

111
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,960
So I can't actually keep pets
or house plants alive,

112
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,400
so I certainly can't keep love
and affection alive.

113
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,280
It's far too much commitment,
generally.

114
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,480
I did a bit of online dating and
then it plays on your insecurities.

115
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,320
It's a terrifying thing to do,

116
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,800
cos you're waiting there
to meet this date,

117
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,600
and you've written your profile,
and you're thinking, 'Well,

118
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,200
'maybe taking ten years off my age
was a bit much, and I did use

119
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,160
'really flattering photos, and I did
pretend I wasn't actually mental.'

120
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,480
So I was a bit worried about what
they were going to think.

121
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,560
So you're waiting there,
you're waiting to see him,

122
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,360
and you're thinking,
'He'll be all right,'

123
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,040
because people are better than that.

124
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,840
The mainstream media would have us
believe that everybody is

125
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,800
shallow and obsessed with
how you look,

126
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,480
but I find that's not my experience
with real people.

127
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,560
Real people will see behind the mess
that you often are and think,

128
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,360
"No, you're a beautiful person,
you're a real person, I like that."

129
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,440
So I was feeling buoyed up about it.

130
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,560
So I see him coming out the station,
I clock him.

131
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,280
I think, "Oh, you minger!"

132
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,720
And often with the dyspraxia,

133
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,960
I come over as very loud
and sweary and scary initially.

134
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,120
If I don't know people especially,
I just get a bit overpowering,

135
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,240
overwhelming and people do get
nervous around me.

136
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,560
This is what they've said.

137
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,400
Obviously it's nonsense and I will
fight anyone that says otherwise.

138
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,600
This is just a classic, apparently,
dyspraxia symptom I hadn't realised.

139
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,120
I used to think I was just this
fascinating personality

140
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,440
with all these quirks,
and I was so interesting.

141
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,520
I discovered I'm nothing but a list
of symptoms and I was very upset.

142
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,000
I've nothing below it,
I'm entirely two-dimensional.

143
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,360
I'm just a condition.

144
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,600
So, this date's looking
a bit nervous already and that's

145
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,880
before the content of what I've said
has become apparent.

146
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,760
This is just the presentation alone
that's scaring the guy.

147
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,480
So I thought, 'We'll go to
the nearest pub,' traipsing along.

148
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,120
So I'm going along as I usually do,
stumbling over, tripping over,

149
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,080
talking loudly, waving my arms
around, hitting lampposts,

150
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,280
and then we try and get into
the pub and the bouncer bars me.

151
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,280
"No, you're not coming in."
I said, "What?"

152
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,960
And the guy says,
"No, you're obviously too drunk.

153
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,320
"You can't come in."
I do get this a lot.

154
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,920
Not always when I'm drunk,
obviously.

155
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,600
So I thought, "I'll argue with him,"
because as we all know,

156
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,880
arguing with a bouncer is
obviously... You obviously win.

157
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,880
You're never going to lose that
argument, talking to bouncers.

158
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,240
So I say to him, "Mate, come on,
this is because I'm Scottish,

159
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,360
"isn't it? You just assume
I've been drinking all morning."

160
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,080
So I'm not being gracious in defeat.

161
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm just swearing and stomping off

162
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,280
and having a go at him
under my breath,

163
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,800
and gently vindicating him
that I just shouldn't be allowed in.

164
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,960
But I was thinking I was looking
quite good cos I'm in my heels,

165
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,840
I'd put my high heels on especially.

166
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,160
And I can't walk in high heels.
Cannot.

167
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,680
Can barely stand in high heels,
but this doesn't stop me.

168
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm in complete denial.

169
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,120
I imagine it makes me look
like some girlie,

170
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,600
delicate little flower,
all sanguine and sexy,

171
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,760
and not like the angry tractor
that I usually look like.

172
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,040
Inevitably, though,
we're going along and I fall.

173
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,760
And I don't fall in the way I think
I would fall in my head,

174
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,600
like, oh, I fell, oh...

175
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,080
..as I would like to fall.
No, no, no.

176
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,640
I come along, I stack it on
the pavement, and it was just

177
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,400
this terrible mess of everything.
Everybody's aware of it.

178
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,800
And my top tip for this...

179
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,040
I've got an MO because
I fall over so many times

180
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,840
..is don't style it out.
Just stay on the ground,

181
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,760
because otherwise
you'll be just mocked.

182
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,360
People will just stand there going,
"I'm filming it for YouTube.

183
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,120
"That's hilarious."
You stay down, they start to worry.

184
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,640
"Oh, hang on..."

185
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,960
LAUGHTER

186
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,520
"Might actually be seriously hurt.

187
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,360
"And how bad will I look
if I'm laughing?"

188
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,039
So stay on that floor,
listen to it all around you.

189
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,119
You've got your pride,
stay on the ground.

190
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,480
The date kind of picks me up off
the ground and I'm quite galled

191
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,720
that he didn't prevent it happening
in the first place,

192
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,960
I'm already resentful.

193
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,480
But fortunately
this has taken place outside a pub,

194
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,760
so...obvious course of action.
So, inside the pub,

195
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,920
I go in and the landlady sees me
coming in, bleeding everywhere.

196
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,240
She comes over with rolls
of toilet paper,

197
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,520
trying to stem the bleeding
and save the furniture.

198
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,040
They send someone off for TCP,
so I'm sitting there in the pub

199
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,960
with blood, tissues, pouring this
over my leg because that adds to

200
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,680
an ambience of a sexy date, I find,
the smell of TCP everywhere.

201
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,440
Who doesn't love that?

202
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,120
At this point I was
cracking open the wine.

203
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,400
At this point I am drinking.

204
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,800
So obviously within seconds
I'm crying into the wine.

205
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,360
"Everything is so difficult!
Why is this happening to me?"

206
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,240
At this point I remember
you're meant to chat, aren't you?

207
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,400
It's small talk, conversation,
which I can't do.

208
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,800
I don't understand.

209
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,040
So I'd written little cues up my arm
and tried to pass it off

210
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,000
as a tribal tattoo on my arm.

211
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,240
So I'm chatting away.
"What do you do?

212
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,960
"Where do you live?
"Pause for a response."

213
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,200
Oh, shit!

214
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,640
So it was every bit as scintillating
as you might imagine.

215
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,280
So we decided to leave.

216
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,680
We left if our own volition,
which is always a win,

217
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,200
if I'm not being asked to leave
or anything, so that's a top time.

218
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,160
Couldn't ask for better than that.

219
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,120
So then I just get back home
and try and forget all about it.

220
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,680
I watch cartoons, sit on the sofa
in my pants, watching telly.

221
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,960
Equilibrium is restored.

222
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,560
But then, a few days later,
I hear from the date. He texts me.

223
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,640
He wants to see me again.

224
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,480
Why? Why would you
put yourself through that?

225
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,480
What sort of person would want
to experience all that again?

226
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,920
What sort of self-esteem
problems do you have?

227
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,880
It's absolutely ridiculous.

228
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,680
I think, "God,
I don't want to know anyone

229
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,800
"that wants to go out with me
again. What a loser!"

230
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,120
LAUGHTER

231
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,440
And that will be one of the many,

232
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,280
many reasons I've been single
for ten years.

233
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,480
And thank you for laughing
at my misfortune,

234
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,240
I'm very glad that you did.

235
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,240
CHEERING

236
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,360
Give it up for Ruby MacKellar!

237
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,600
Oh, my God.

238
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,440
That was her first time
ever on stage.

239
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,800
CHEERING

240
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,320
I've slept with worse comedians
than that. That was amazing!

241
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,320
We are about to have another
storyteller on the stage.

242
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,880
Are you ready for that?

243
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,400
CHEERING

244
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,840
Please give a warm round of
applause to the amazing Mik Scarlet!

245
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,920
CHEERING

246
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,320
Now, when I first discussed with
the BBC Ouch team what I'd be

247
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,680
talking about today, I said,
"Can I talk about how I met

248
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,360
"my wonderful wife?" who is sitting
just there. Hello, wonderful wife.

249
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,360
"A romantic story of seeing her
across a crowded dance floor

250
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,320
"and how I immediately knew
that she was the one for me?"

251
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,240
"No," they said,
"No, that's really boring.

252
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,160
"What we want is something edgy,

253
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,520
"something that's going
to push boundaries."

254
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,640
And then I thought, "I know,
I'm going to talk about my willy,

255
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,040
"and sex, because that's edgy,
isn't it?"

256
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,520
I woke up one morning,
on the morning of my German O-level,

257
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,600
and found that my legs hurt and
my back really hurt and every time

258
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,080
I tried to stand up I fell over.

259
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,280
So of course an ambulance
was called, I was rushed to hospital

260
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,800
and it transpired that
my spine had collapsed.

261
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,360
Yes, it is true, folks, you can
break your back in your sleep.

262
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,160
I just thought I'd tell all you
bipeds that just to make your day.

263
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,280
Ha-ha-ha!

264
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,080
So, eventually I came out of
hospital and as you can tell,

265
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,200
I had lost the ability to walk.
There was no more standing for me.

266
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,440
There was also no more
standing to attention down there.

267
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,000
I had lost what the doctors call
erectile function.

268
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,320
I knew that would happen,
complete silence.

269
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,400
So, I thought, "That's it,
game over, man, game over."

270
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,280
I thought that was it.
So I got really down and depressed.

271
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,360
I thought, "I know,
I'll become what's known as

272
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,200
"the world's best male friend,"

273
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,360
and all my girlfriends would come
round and I'd do their hair

274
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,520
and I'd do their make-up
and I'd dress them all up

275
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,840
and then I'd send them out on dates,

276
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,040
normally with blokes wearing
leather jackets -

277
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,440
which is why I now wear leather
all the while - on mopeds,

278
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,520
and if they were real bastards,
they owned a Ford Capri,

279
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,000
which, trust me, when I was young,

280
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,520
was a giveaway sign that it was
going to be bad.

281
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,160
And then what would happen is,
that night she'd come back round

282
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,000
my house and cry on my shoulder,
going,

283
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,200
"Mik, he had sex with me
and then he dumped me!

284
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,120
"Oh, why can't boys be like you?"

285
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,640
I, of course, didn't see this
as what I would now

286
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,480
obviously recognise as a come-on.
What I thought was,

287
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,680
"They're never going to want to be
with me because I can't do it."

288
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,360
So I would be like, "Oh, yeah, don't
worry, next time you'll be fine."

289
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,360
One of my best female friends
came to me and said,

290
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,400
"Look, Mik, I've met this girl
and I think she's great.

291
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,560
"Will you come to a party and
meet her and all of her friends?"

292
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,960
"Yeah, of course." So I arrived.

293
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,080
I was the one wearing the most
make-up in the room.

294
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,560
We're all there and we're
all getting on famously and then,

295
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,080
as was the fashion back then,

296
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,840
it was time for a game and everyone
said, "Let's play truth or dare."

297
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,800
We always played truth or dare
at every party.

298
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,400
I don't know why, because it always
ended up with a row,

299
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,080
normally because we were either
too truthful or too daring,

300
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,560
normally too truthful.

301
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,800
But I thought, "This could be it.
This could be my chance.

302
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,160
"I can tell my secret."

303
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,080
Because up until then,
I'd kept it quite quiet.

304
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,520
My brother didn't know,
my mum and dad didn't know,

305
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,240
even my doctors didn't know.
I was keeping it in.

306
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,520
Yes, I was going to admit
to Mr Floppy.

307
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,520
It was going to be great.

308
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,160
Were they sympathetic?
Were they caring?

309
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,800
Not at first.

310
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,520
You know when someone laughs just
beyond that point where it's just,

311
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,960
"Hang on a minute, it's not funny
any more I'm feeling really upset"?

312
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,200
It was that.

313
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,880
But eventually my friend wiped away
the tears, got her breath back,

314
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,760
came up, stood up,
got up off the floor,

315
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,360
whacked me round the head and said,
"Mik, you idiot.

316
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,480
"We're girls. We don't have willies.

317
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,400
"And we make love to girls
and we do it very well."

318
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,080
"Yay," they all cried, of course
they did.

319
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,360
I thought, "Duh."

320
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,240
I honestly hadn't worked that out,

321
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,200
which kind of shows how innocent
I was as a teenager.

322
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,800
So, at the time,
lesbianism and feminism were very,

323
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,320
very closely associated
and they were very radical,

324
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,320
these girls, and they truly believed
that what was wrong with the planet

325
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,640
was men and their erectile function
and penetration.

326
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,720
All penetration was bad.

327
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,400
So suddenly I was this new
type of man, a man that

328
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,440
had the next evolutionary leap
for man, according to these girls,

329
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,320
and they thought it was great.
I really liked these girls.

330
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,440
They were cool.

331
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,360
And they took me under their wing
and they even made me

332
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,880
an honorary lesbian.

333
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,160
And I used to go on lesbian marches.

334
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,280
There was me and a lot of girls
and just this bloke

335
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,040
wearing lots of make-up,
looking like Boy George on wheels.

336
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,600
Kind of like a cross between
Boy George and a Dalek, going,

337
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,440
"Yeah, down with men!
Men are bad, yeah!" Right?

338
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:25,800
And they also taught me how to
make love to a woman like a woman.

339
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,440
Now, I wonder how many people here
are imagining some kind of

340
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,240
weird pornographic thing.
No, I'm still a guy,

341
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,000
they still wouldn't have
gone near me.

342
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,880
They just taught me -
told me with words, not actions.

343
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,200
Sadly, but there you go.

344
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,880
And when I was telling the BBC,
actually, about this, they said,

345
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,280
"Are you going to tell anyone? Are
you going to tell us what they said?

346
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,120
"Please tell us!"

347
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,640
Well, no, I'm not. No.

348
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,400
I'm afraid I'm not letting you know,

349
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,800
because that would be
betraying the sisterhood

350
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,040
and actually
letting all those trade secrets out.

351
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,840
So, girls,
if you want to know what it's like,

352
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,800
you're just going to have to make
love to a woman.

353
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,720
Thank you very much and goodnight.

354
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,960
CHEERING

355
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,080
Give it up for Mik Scarlet!

356
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,600
That was amazing. I think everyone
could learn from that story,

357
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,680
everyone.

358
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,880
Everyone!

359
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,200
If anyone wants any pointers,
I'll be at the bar.

360
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,120
Are you ready for another
storyteller?
CHEERING

361
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,720
Yes! Then please put your hands
together,

362
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,640
give it up for the amazing
John Servante!

363
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,880
CHEERING

364
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,440
I told a fundamental lie
to get here tonight.

365
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,840
The producers phoned me
a couple of weeks ago and said,

366
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,680
"Right, John, just so you know,
the event is going to be at

367
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,480
"Bethnal Green and in front of
a live audience."

368
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,160
I said, "Sorry, what?"
They said, "Bethnal Green."

369
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,440
I said,
"No, that's not the problem."

370
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,560
So, for many years I have
suffered from depression.

371
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,520
Now, what does that actually mean?

372
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,560
Some of you might say if
your goldfish dies or nobody likes

373
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,599
your Facebook status that
you have depression.

374
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,879
For me, it's a little more
persistent than that.

375
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,680
I suffer with major depressions
that can last for weeks,

376
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,359
maybe even months at a time.

377
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,759
I have feelings of
malaise and sadness

378
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,920
and sometimes even
suicidal thoughts.

379
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,079
To put it another way, according to
Professor Robert Sapolsky,

380
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:27,879
I have a neurological disorder with
a biochemical and genetic component

381
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,400
where I just can't
appreciate sunsets.

382
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,960
I was diagnosed when I was
a student at university.

383
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,960
This made me quite unpopular.

384
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,000
I studied English, but even
the Gothic literature fans

385
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,600
thought I was
a bit too morose and depressing.

386
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,080
LAUGHTER

387
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,040
In my final year as a student,
I decided I wanted

388
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,680
to leave university as
a proper undergraduate,

389
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,440
so I needed to get wasted,
I need to go out clubbing

390
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,600
and I needed to get off with
some random strangers.

391
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,600
My more sensible therapist suggested
I should just join a society.

392
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,320
So eventually I settled upon drama,
because it's socially acceptable

393
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,920
for a director to sit in a dark room
and just yell, "This is awful!"

394
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,800
So, at the time,
a new friend of mine, Avine,

395
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,840
offered to help me put on a play.

396
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,880
Now, Avine was a very talented
theatre student

397
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,120
and she was also just
a really lovely person.

398
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,280
When she'd found out about
my condition,

399
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,640
she confided in me that she had
a family history of mental illness.

400
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,360
So after, you know,
making a bit of a bond with Avine,

401
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,000
I discovered this was somebody
I could work with.

402
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,720
She was not the kind of person
who was ever going to ask me,

403
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,880
"Can't you just cheer up?"

404
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,720
because she understood that was like
asking a wheelchair user to stand.

405
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,560
So, she encouraged me to be more
open and honest with people

406
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:55,200
and that kind of helped me
get into the whole drama thing.

407
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,680
After she organised some auditions,
I realised I faced a huge challenge.

408
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,720
The antidepressants I was taking
at the time meant that

409
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,760
I couldn't concentrate for
any length of time.

410
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,760
I would sort of zone out or just
completely lose focus altogether.

411
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,040
So, how was I going to make it
through an audition?

412
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,880
Well, I came up with a simple
and incredibly stupid idea.

413
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,400
Without consulting my doctor
or weaning myself off,

414
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,640
I just stopped taking
my antidepressants.

415
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,480
What was the worst
that could happen?

416
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,560
So, the first day, true enough,
nothing happened, I was fine.

417
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,400
The second day I felt a bit dodgy
but, you know, it was all good.

418
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,240
By the day of the auditions,
I woke up a member of the mumbling,

419
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,120
stumbling dead.

420
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,560
I had a headache, I couldn't really
concentrate on anything,

421
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,800
I felt disorientated and
I felt very, very nauseous.

422
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,600
If you ever want to wreck an actor's
confidence, just say to them,

423
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,880
"Sorry,
could you do that line again?

424
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,400
"I was trying not to vomit."

425
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,120
Avine was unbelievably angry with me

426
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,000
that I'd just decided to stop
taking antidepressants.

427
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And in the car journey
on the way home,

428
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,120
I decided to sort of break the ice
and I said to her,

429
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,680
"So, who do you think
were the best actors today?"

430
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,760
And as she listed
all of these different people,

431
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,560
I started to get
more and more angry.

432
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,600
She was mentioning all of the sort
of stereotypical attractive types.

433
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,160
You know, the young men and women
with sort of designer clothes

434
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:26,360
and trendy haircuts and gym bodies,
which I really hated at the time.

435
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,880
I said, "You know what?

436
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,720
"I never thought of you as the kind
of sort of shallow human being.

437
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,480
"I thought you were a nicer person
than that. You confided stuff in me.

438
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,040
"I'm actually starting to think
you're a pretty bad person.

439
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,280
"Maybe I don't want to make
this play with you any more.

440
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,240
"Maybe you don't really understand
the subtle nuances of human pain."

441
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,320
She said, "Well, I'm not
a superficial person at all,

442
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,640
"actually." I said,
"Yeah, yeah, sure, whatever.

443
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,000
"You're just lying to me."

444
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,720
So she started to have a go at me

445
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,240
but she calmed herself down
and stopped because, you know,

446
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,440
she's a lovely, empathetic person
and I'm not.

447
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,800
I said, "I bet you've never been
interested in somebody who's

448
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,680
"maybe over six foot,

449
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,200
"a bit kind of lanky."

450
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,160
I just start going on this
diatribe about how, you know,

451
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,920
there were ugly people in the world
who are really nice, too,

452
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,360
because when you're suffering
with depression,

453
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,640
you go through this period of

454
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,760
wanting to make sure everybody else
knows that you're feeling shit

455
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,840
and you want them to
kind of feel shit as well

456
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,840
because it becomes like your
moral duty to point out to everybody

457
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,360
that the world is a really, really
bad place and it's really dark

458
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,960
and all those smiles
that you see in the crowd,

459
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,280
they've just got to go, because
they're deliberately designed to

460
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,800
offend you and everything's
morose - what's wrong with you?

461
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,080
I haven't got a problem -
you've got a problem!

462
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,360
And she sort of, as if she
could hear all this nonsense

463
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,440
churning about in my head, said,

464
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,800
"You know, I actually like
plenty of unusual people."

465
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,840
I said, "Oh, yeah? Yeah, really?
You're a liar. That's what you are.

466
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,040
"You're a liar.
You don't like anybody unusual.

467
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,120
"Who do you like who's unusual?
Go on, tell me.

468
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,240
"Who do you like who's unusual?"
She said, "Well...

469
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,440
"you."

470
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,200
Now, I dealt with this really well.

471
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,520
I just let a silence rest over
the car for about five minutes.

472
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:14,600
I was thinking whilst I was driving
along, "Why would she...? What?

473
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,440
"No. There's been a mistake here.
I've misunderstood things.

474
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,440
"She didn't mean that she likes me
because nobody likes me and...

475
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,480
"and I'm misanthropic and I know,
I've heard the voices, they told me

476
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,320
"I'm going to be forever alone
and that's my destiny from now on."

477
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,200
As I pulled up to my student house,

478
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,280
I turned to her and,
with a cringing earnestness, I said,

479
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,680
"Why would you say that?"

480
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,720
She was too embarrassed
at this point to look at me

481
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,680
and she just said,
"Well, I know that, you know,

482
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,920
"you don't feel the same
but that's how I feel and...

483
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,040
"and...yeah, I do like you
and...and... So there.

484
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,600
"I know we're just
going to be friends

485
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,520
"but I've put it out there now."

486
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,120
A couple of days later,
I decided to ask her on a date.

487
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,200
Because, of course,
if it all went wrong

488
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,720
and I vomited on her or something,

489
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,520
it would just prove my worldview
that everything was terrible and

490
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,960
I could go back to being depressed
and happy with my depression.

491
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,160
But, to my surprise, it went well,
very well, and to this day,

492
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,760
some three and a half years later,
we are still together.

493
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,480
CHEERING

494
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,640
So depression's a difficult
condition to live with.

495
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,560
It can often be a bit
like trying to find land

496
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,120
when you're on this
sort of dark and black sea.

497
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,920
But however lost I get in
my own thoughts and my misery

498
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,120
and my stupid, stupid ramblings

499
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,560
and wanting to make other people
feel crap about themselves,

500
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,840
I always have
a shining light that anchors me

501
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,720
and invites me to come home

502
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,760
and that's my lovely girlfriend.

503
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,920
AUDIENCE: Aww!

504
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,480
CHEERING

505
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,440
Give it up for John Servante!

506
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,760
APPLAUSE

507
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,880
OK. Who needs a hug now?

508
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,000
LAUGHTER

509
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Right? Right? Oh, my God.

510
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,720
I would cry if I had a soul.

511
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,400
So bloody beautiful. Are you ready
to see another storyteller?

512
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,200
CHEERING

513
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,680
Of course you are. Please welcome
to the stage Georgie Morrell.

514
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,080
CHEERING

515
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,400
My story isn't about
romantic love, as such,

516
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,360
but it is about some of the most

517
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,880
significant relationships
of my life.

518
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,360
My mum's helping me have a bath.

519
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,600
Yes, it's weird.
Actually, it's tragic.

520
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,520
She's helped me have a bath because
at this point

521
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,880
I have lost my sight
for a couple of weeks at this stage.

522
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,160
It's been a couple of weeks
and, long story short,

523
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,400
I have been blind
in my left eye since I was 16

524
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,720
and at the age of 21
my other eye's decided,

525
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,320
"That looks like a laugh.

526
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,360
"I'll copy that."

527
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,840
The doctors don't know what to do.

528
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,160
They don't know whether they can
restore my sight, when, if,

529
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:19,320
and I'm in what I can best
describe as a blind limbo.

530
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,800
Not too sure what's going to happen.

531
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,120
Mum's helping me have a bath.

532
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,800
I am mortified,
absolutely mortified.

533
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,000
She hasn't seen me naked in years.

534
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,080
She, however, surprisingly
comfortable in the situation.

535
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,960
Chatty, even.

536
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,080
Can't shut her up.

537
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,240
I think she's enjoying it
more than she should.

538
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,400
Me and my brothers
have flown the nest,

539
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,960
we've all grown up and one has
come back with a broken wing,

540
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,520
or eye in this instance,

541
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,000
and she gets to play doting mother
again, like she used to.

542
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,920
And I have to admit she's
terribly, terribly good at it.

543
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,680
My mortification
quickly turns to despair.

544
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,920
I don't know whether I'll get
my sight back, I don't know when.

545
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,560
It's not the blindness that's
getting to me, it is this unknown.

546
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,280
Do the doctors know
what they're doing?

547
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,080
Will Mum have to bathe me forever?

548
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,240
And more than anything,

549
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,200
it's not that I don't love my mum
and my dad and the family home

550
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,280
that I've had to move back to at 21,

551
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,800
it's...it's not the life I had.

552
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:24,160
It's not my sexy London life that I
was just living as a postgraduate,

553
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,400
spending my dad's money
and partying.

554
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,680
Essentially what I did.

555
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,520
Partying in London, in Soho,
Camden, Bethnal Green. Wahey.

556
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,400
And it's not the dreams I had of
being a famous one-eyed comedian.

557
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,160
I have a flannel across my eyes.

558
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,880
My mum insists on it.

559
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,760
She's rinsing my hair. She doesn't
want water to get in my eyes.

560
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,080
I really don't see
the harm at this stage.

561
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,160
What's a bit of water?

562
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,920
I want to cry.

563
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,480
I really want to cry but I don't
want my mum to see me cry

564
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,960
and I think, "I could cry into this
flannel and she wouldn't know."

565
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,440
And just before
I can squeeze one tear out

566
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,320
to fall into the bath around me,

567
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,400
there's a knock
on the bathroom door.

568
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,520
It's my dad.

569
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,760
"Do NOT come in, Dad!"

570
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,280
It is one thing for Mum to see me
in the bath but not my dad.

571
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,120
That is really weird.

572
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,560
He's questioning the shopping list
that Mum's left out for him.

573
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,400
"What's the pink Vanish?" he says.

574
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,160
"It's for the carpet."
"Why? What's wrong with the carpet?"

575
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,960
Through the bathroom door,
this is, by the way.

576
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,520
"Don't question my list, Tony.
Just get it."

577
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,240
I laugh a little,
first time I have in a while,

578
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,680
because their bickering,

579
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,840
that familiarity
cheers me up a little bit.

580
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,240
I get out the bath and I sort of
dry myself off and I tell Mum

581
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,880
I can take it from here,

582
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,440
go into my room,
slip on a dressing gown,

583
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,680
towel dry my hair
and I plait it to one side.

584
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,080
It's weird what you can still
remember to do without seeing.

585
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,680
I sit on the end of the bed
and, as if on cue,

586
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,360
Mum's knocking at the door.
I don't know what it is with mums.

587
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,040
They know when you're upset and
they know they have to fix it,

588
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,760
as best you hide it from them.

589
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,880
I tell her it's not fair. I don't
know if I'm going to see again.

590
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,720
What are the doctors doing? Do they
really think...? Will I see again?

591
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,400
Which way is this going to go? Am
I going to have to move back home?

592
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,480
Will you have to bathe me forever,
woman? Surely not.

593
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,280
Before she can give me
any words of reassurance,

594
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,600
my brother has come into the room.

595
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,480
My big brother, Sam,

596
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,880
is the only man I love
more than myself...

597
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,040
but I also want to strangle
on a daily basis.

598
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,440
He says he's brought me
a glass of water.

599
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,760
He heard I was upset
and wants to cheer me up.

600
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,480
I say, "Thank you, Sam.
That's really, really sweet."

601
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,160
He hands it to my mum,
who goes to hand it to me.

602
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,840
Before my little hands can clasp it,
she snatches it away and says,

603
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,560
"Oh, for goodness' sake!"

604
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,440
"What? What's going on?
I just wanted some water."

605
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,560
"It's not water.

606
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,200
"It's an empty glass
with a spider in it."

607
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,800
Wish I was making this up,
some days, I really do.

608
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,280
I have never asked my brother
why he did that,

609
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,840
put a spider in a glass with
the hope of me eating it...

610
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,160
but I'm so, so glad he did.

611
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,520
Bear with me on this.

612
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,800
He runs off laughing his face off,
he's so pleased,

613
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,440
and I'm laughing hard.

614
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,520
Really the first chuckle
I've had in ages.

615
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,760
And I realise in that moment,

616
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,280
just because I'm blind
doesn't mean I can't make jokes,

617
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,600
I can't be the victim
of my brother's pranks,

618
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,840
I can't move back to London
and have the life that I intended

619
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,840
and be a one-eyed comedian.

620
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,800
And he made me realise that
and it was really, really special.

621
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,560
The word relationship, for me,
is far too basic a word

622
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,760
to describe those three people
in that dark year.

623
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,400
They became more than
my family members.

624
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,240
They were not just my mum,
my dad and my brother.

625
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,040
They were my eternal companions,

626
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,440
guiding me through that darkness,
always at my side.

627
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,280
There's every chance
I will go blind again...

628
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,960
..but I don't fear it
like I once did,

629
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,920
I really don't any more,

630
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,320
because I have a dad who will
guide me through crowds,

631
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,880
ready to put himself in harm's way,

632
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:22,720
a mum who will not flinch at her
crying, naked daughter in a bath,

633
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,280
and a brother who will make me
laugh at whatever cost.

634
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,640
It's experiences like these of
being disabled that bind you to

635
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,960
certain people forever and in that
I feel incredibly privileged.

636
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,360
Thank you very much.
Absolute pleasure. Cheers.

637
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,560
CHEERING

638
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,640
Give it up for Georgie Morrell!

639
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,880
APPLAUSE

640
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,480
I think, for all of us
older siblings,

641
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,360
we feel much better now

642
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,080
about the torment
of our younger siblings.

643
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,560
I once tried to put my sister's foot

644
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,000
into the wheel of
a bike to break it.

645
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,360
The foot, not the bike.

646
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,920
Because my mum had been like,

647
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,200
"Oh, don't put your sister's foot in
the bike cos then this ambulance

648
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,960
"will come and they make weird
noises and it's so exciting and you

649
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,640
"have to go to the hospital, then
you can't go to school tomorrow,"

650
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,120
and I was like,
"Come on, Laura. Come on!"

651
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,440
Please start applauding,
whooping, cheering,

652
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,120
give it up for the amazing
Gianluca Trombetta!

653
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,280
CHEERING

654
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,680
Hello.

655
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:27,040
So, I grew up with hearing loss,
moderately severe,

656
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,160
which means that essentially
I can't function in society

657
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,560
without my hearing aids.

658
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,160
So I've got these small devices.

659
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,640
The funny thing is that
I didn't wear them

660
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,880
until I was, like, 20 years old.

661
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,320
So for the first
20 years of my life,

662
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,120
I didn't hear much.

663
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,520
So how did I get by?

664
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,560
I essentially just hung out
with a lot of loud people.

665
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,560
Literally.

666
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:58,800
And so I grew up in Italy
so maybe you...

667
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,000
you've heard some of
those people over there.

668
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,320
I come from a family, we are 14
people, everyone is very loud.

669
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,680
You can't really understand
how loud they are.

670
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,760
Every time I go back for Christmas,

671
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,680
I have to take my hearing aids off.

672
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,280
It's...

673
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,800
It's just crazy.

674
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,200
So I have a girlfriend.
Her name is Elise.

675
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,680
She is British, from Newcastle,

676
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,160
but she doesn't have a Geordie
accent otherwise I'm not sure

677
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,920
I would understand
anything she's saying.

678
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,200
But she speaks very loudly
and she moves her hands a lot

679
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,040
and, as an Italian,
I find this very attractive.

680
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,360
The only thing,
she can speak quite fast.

681
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,120
You know, when we moved in together,

682
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,600
communication was
a little bit complicated...

683
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,400
..because she is not used

684
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,640
to speaking to someone
who has hearing loss,

685
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,440
so she speaks to me
as I have perfect hearing.

686
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,640
And even if I wear hearing aids,

687
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,640
the thing is that I can't hear 100%.

688
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,680
So, to give you an example,
if I am in the kitchen, busy,

689
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,280
doing something like cooking,

690
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,320
and you walk into the room and
start talking to me right away

691
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,600
when I'm not seeing you,

692
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,120
I can't hear, very likely,
the beginning of what you just said.

693
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,880
Even worse, if you speak to me
from a different room.

694
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,200
So I had to tell Elise,
"Look, when you speak to me,

695
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,840
"speak while facing me and speak
loudly, don't cover your mouth,

696
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,400
"don't mumble, etc, and don't
speak to me from another room."

697
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,400
But Elise will forget
about these things,

698
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:32,120
so I had to come up with my...
you know, with a new strategy.

699
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,320
So my strategy was dog training.

700
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,040
I was going to train Elise
as if she was a dog

701
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,240
and I thought that was a good idea.

702
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,000
So every time I couldn't hear her,

703
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,360
I would interrupt Elise
and I would call her by her name

704
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,880
and I would tell her
what she did wrong.

705
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,120
"Elise, you didn't speak
while facing me,"

706
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,640
or, "Elise, you were mumbling.
Elise..."

707
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:58,800
I'm annoying myself now.
Imagine how annoying it was to her.

708
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:03,320
So obviously I thought this was
a great idea and I kept going.

709
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,320
I took it one step further.

710
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,200
I introduced marks on the wall.

711
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,639
So we had...we had a chalkboard
at home, so I said,

712
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,839
"Elise, every time
you make a mistake,

713
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,719
"we're going to make
a mark on the wall,"

714
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:18,119
which didn't work out because,
believe it or not,

715
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,400
I realised one day
that she wasn't a dog.

716
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,360
What really worked, we decided
a couple of ground rules.

717
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,679
The first rule was that we would
always speak in the same room,

718
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,079
no exceptions.

719
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,600
And the second rule
was the attention rule.

720
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,120
So Elise would always try to
get my attention first

721
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,280
and I would up always give
my attention to her,

722
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,760
so I would stop doing
something and tune in.

723
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,840
This worked because
we were both relaxed

724
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,080
and we were open
to accept criticism so...

725
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,719
And it wasn't like I was trying to
interrupt her all the time,

726
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,239
which was really frustrating.

727
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:56,639
And Elise even came up with her
own ways of calling my attention

728
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,800
that wasn't by using
my name all the time,

729
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,600
which is a bit awkward in the house.
"Gianluca, Gianluca..."

730
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,800
So what she did was to
start using filler words.

731
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,960
So before starting to speak to me,
she would start saying,

732
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,400
"By the way," or, "You know what?"

733
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,280
And this was great because it
gave me the time to tune in

734
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,960
and I miss much less now,

735
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,600
but I still miss things,

736
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,520
but a beautiful thing is that
I don't get frustrated any more

737
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,240
because I know that she cares.

738
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,560
Thank you.

739
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,600
CHEERING

740
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,920
Gianluca Trombetta!

741
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,200
CHEERING

742
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,480
Amazing. So, that's so good.

743
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,320
We have one more storyteller this
evening. Are you up for that?

744
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,720
CHEERING

745
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,880
You've been great
and everyone's been great so far.

746
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,360
This next storyteller
is someone I'm very proud to know.

747
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,920
You're going to absolutely love her.

748
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,960
Please start whooping
and cheering and applauding

749
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,640
for the amazing Harriet Dyer.

750
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,920
CHEERING

751
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,520
All right there?

752
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:00,520
Wear an outfit that sums up
mental health. You're welcome.

753
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,840
That's my thing.

754
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:07,880
I've got bipolar and it's caused
some mayhem in my relationships.

755
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,520
I've got a boyfriend at the minute
and he's, like, proper the one.

756
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,080
It's absolutely lovely, so I doubt
you want to hear about that.

757
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,920
But before such an
understanding boyfriend,

758
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,760
this guy I was seeing had a problem
with me doing stand-up comedy,

759
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,960
I think, because... I'm melting.

760
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,400
..because he... I think he thought
it questioned his manininity.

761
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,560
I don't think that's a word,
Harriet. No.

762
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,640
And so he kept telling me
that his job was more important

763
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:36,040
and all of that and then one day
we were in bed and he was telling me

764
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,080
how good he'd be at comedy,
so he was pretending there was

765
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,200
a front row of...of...of women.

766
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,480
There were woman in
the front row and he was like,

767
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,760
"Yeah, if you don't laugh at my
jokes, you're obviously lesbians."

768
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,360
Yeah, that's the...

769
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,160
That's who I was dating.

770
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:57,360
And then he's seen my medication,
when I was taking it, by my bed,

771
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,880
and he's asked what it was,
and I'm quite an open book

772
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,160
so I said what it was and he goes,

773
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,280
"Does that mean you're
going to kill me in the night?"

774
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,760
It didn't mean that

775
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,480
but if you carry on talking...

776
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:20,320
The first time I thought I was in
love, I was at uni and this guy, oh,

777
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,280
I just couldn't believe that someone
like him would be interested in me.

778
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,720
He was so good looking.

779
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,960
But there were, like, signs
that maybe it wasn't to be.

780
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,160
Here was a sign.

781
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,280
Once we were in bed and
I've woken up in the night

782
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,560
with a very wet back
and I've gone,

783
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,400
"Why is my back wet here, pal?"

784
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,560
And he said, "Sorry, babe.

785
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,800
"I dreamt you were a urinal."

786
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,920
Dreamt I was a urinal,
wee'd up my back in the night.

787
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,240
That's not a keeper, is it?

788
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:52,280
And then when I was...

789
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,200
A keeper.

790
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,880
When I was at uni,
there was this girl

791
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,080
that I proper worshipped
the ground she walked on.

792
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,360
I thought she was wonderful.

793
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,920
She was a really strong,
independent woman, really funny,

794
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,600
really liked her,
so she became my best friend.

795
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,680
And then, after a while, going out
with this guy, I said to her,

796
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,600
my best friend, I said, "Something
doesn't sit right with me.

797
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,320
"I don't know, I don't trust him.
There is something not right."

798
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,200
And she... Cos obviously she's
my best friend

799
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,960
so I've opened up
about stuff and all that.

800
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,800
And she's gone, "No, Harriet,
this is just your mental health

801
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,080
"just telling you this,
it's all in your head."

802
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,360
I was like, "Oh, all right."

803
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,120
And then when I spoke to him
about it, he said the same thing

804
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,640
so I was like,
"Oh, OK. That's what happened."

805
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,400
They were together, right?

806
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,000
Yeah, how bad is that?
They were getting together.

807
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,160
And then when I proper caught them
in it, they were doing the whole,

808
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,520
"Yeah, but this is cos
of your childhood, Harriet,"

809
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,400
and this and that.
So it wasn't even what they'd done,

810
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,920
it was the fact they were using all
that against me and...it was so...

811
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,360
I was livid.

812
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:51,720
I was livid.
And so they were just lying at me

813
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,040
and I punched them both in the face

814
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,960
but because I'm not a fighter,

815
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,640
I've punched them both
in the forehead, right?

816
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,200
And I've broke both my hands.

817
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,720
Honestly.

818
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,280
And then, because they're just such
horrible people, that wasn't enough.

819
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,560
So I've gone home and then
she's rang the police, right?

820
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,480
So then the next morning,
I'm in my halls of residence

821
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,160
and I've got woken up by the
police and they've arrested me.

822
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:25,080
So then I've been carted to
a prison cell with this...

823
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,200
And they just put me
in the cell with this guy

824
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,360
and he had just one tooth,

825
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,240
and then he's just
shouting nonsense at me.

826
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,720
He said that he invented
toothpaste, right?

827
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,920
I said, "What are you on about?"

828
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,640
And it made me laugh
after all this nonsense.

829
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,560
So I've gone, "Mate, I don't
think you did invent toothpaste."

830
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,160
And he's gone,
"No, if you think about it,

831
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,960
"if someone with lots of teeth
invented toothpaste,

832
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,080
"it'd be called teethpaste."

833
00:39:54,080 --> 00:40:00,000
I thought, "Oh, right. You can't
really argue with that, really."

834
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,840
And that is, honest to God,
is on my record forever.

835
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,120
Like, I used to do teaching
and that is just so sad

836
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,560
that that is on my record.

837
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,040
Pah!

838
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,520
Thanks ever so much. Cheers.

839
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,840
