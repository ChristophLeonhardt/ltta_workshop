earlier this week as you probably heard the great great writer Tom Wolfe died at the age of 88 the literary giant chronicled social upheaval in America immersing readers and everything from the California hippie counterculture to the space race to Manhattan's money status seekers he was one of the leading practitioners of what came to be known as New Journalism a style very familiar now that infuses reporting with novelistic Flair and unconventional grammar Wolfe succeeded in coining phrases that defined eras expressions like radical chic and the me decade and with the bonfire of the vanities he made the successful late career transition into a novelist a practice he called stalking the billion footed feast shortly after his work of nonfiction the write stuff was turned into a blockbuster movie the grandson of a Confederate rifleman wolf was born in Richmond Virginia he began its journalism career as a reporter at the Springfield Union in Massachusetts and then moved to the Washington Post and eventually to the New York Herald Tribune he later achieved his greatest national notoriety with a number of innovative pieces for both New York Magazine and Esquire Wolff was almost as well known for his attire that he proclaimed NiO pretentious instantly recognizable walking the streets of New York City in his signature three-piece suit Tom Wolfe the man William F Buckley Jr once called the most skillful writer in America died this week at 88 Jon Meacham so much to say about Tom Wolfe just going through the titles electric kool-aid acid test the right stuff bonfire the vanities pick your favorite but you knew him a little bit talk about Tom Wolfe the man and the writer well you think about it there's so few journalists who make a lasting mark there are so few novelists who do and Wolfe managed to take these two genres put them together and I think will be read as long as anyone wants to understand the American Century as you say he defined whole eras largely by not only his great artistic skill but as he always liked to say you've got to go there he was one of the world's great reporters he would eat when he was doing a book a man in full about Atlanta he was down there the reason radical chic happened is he sort of wandered into the party at the Bernstein's which where the Black Panthers were and he knew that there was a story there and he wrote what he saw and he wrote it better than damn near anybody you know the great I think one of the best books ever written about politics ever but certainly the best book of our time is in some ways a wolffian monument it's Richard Bing Kramer's what it takes and that's not possible without Wolfe and so one of the ways you have to measure anybody is is what influence did they have beyond their own pages and I think there are a number of people who are both in the business and writing today who are there because their world was electrified if you will by wolf's prose yeah you know the other aspect of him John is that he was a wonderfully generous human being to others in the business he was willing to sit listen offer advice but at his root he changed both businesses I think both journalism and novel writing and he did so because in addition to being a great reporter he was an even better observer of the life around us and the little the little things that you only pick up on if you sit there and listen and watch and observe and it wasn't without feeling I mean I when I read this he once said about fiction that the problem with fiction is it has to be plausible which is not the case with nonfiction which is so true in the time of Trump but he didn't just listen he felt things they mean his descriptions of loneliness and despair and I'm Charlotte Simmons the reason I wanted to write novels I mean it wasn't just a neutral detached observer he he sort of crossed that transom of feeling all the angst feeling the agony feeling despair and putting it on the page and just was a poet our friend Peggy Noonan wrote an appreciation of her friend Tom Wolfe and a piece entitled hats off to Tom Peggy writes he picked up American journalism and shook it hard then he picked it up the novel and shook that too he invented characters that presented us to ourselves he issued one of the great literary manifestos stop your navel-gazing get after notebook there's a world exploding out there he strutted through the world like some crazed antique peacock the faded vanilla suits the high collar shirts polkadot ties the socks a handkerchief the spats goodbye Tom Wolfe may you be awed thrilled and over the moon this day by what you find now a new and unreported world flights of angels oh it was good to have him here wasn't it that from the great Peggy Noonan thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more four Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
