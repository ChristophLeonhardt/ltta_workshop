well Osia notes are on video tibia doctor Saamy God go real saw what the moon is like for casual shot yeah you have 41 years ago he told me I'm happy to see you here in space 30-second countdown Roger ground control gives the okay to open the hatches Aleksey went out for 12 minutes first one ever to fly in space her here was a Soviet cosmonaut floated in his space he pushes off and he says look no problem then we thought she that looks simple that looks easy I did not know - I knew him later about the problems Sergei look you've got 12 degrees in the heating loop it sounds a little bit too low would you like to set it higher no it's fine I'm moving around so I'm nice and warm a spacewalk it's the most difficult and dangerous activity you're a human your body's under constant pressure that's huge pressure if anything happens you can't just run away Sergei well further is busy inside could you have a look at the first 360 camera do you think you could fix it right I'm on it's only one is turning on again during the spacewalk I had a Soviet camera called Ajax the head of the KGB yuri andropov he personally gave me that camera see I was supposed to operate via a special spacesuit button it was controlled by a manipulator on my hip however during the spacewalk of the spacesuit got inflated but I couldn't reach it it was just an inch away from the manipulator I'll ask the photo shoot didn't happen I had an idea back there it would be great to stand right on the edge of the ship as it circles the planet and take a panoramic shot of the earth we never made it though we didn't have the lenses or cameras that make it possible today I went to the moon I went in the lunar budget was out of ten miles but I didn't walk out and spoke but I just got to be a kick walking out looking down like ilex yourself what's your home now you have this chance go ahead here's an embolic oh now they don't have a sight this thing always coming out this is absolutely fantastic amazing shot this is almost exactly what I saw when I was up there it's just in my case it was a long time ago today everyone can see it and feel a part of the universe it's a chance to appreciate how vast our world is and how big the ISS is it's more than 400 tons with 1.5 hectares of solar panels and 12 modules it boasts the most expensive equipment that humanity has ever invented it's a flying laboratory worth thirty three billion dollars it's absolutely unique and the guys up there are doing a fantastic job of running this lab I'm really proud that the next generation of space explorers can handle it the maximum time between satellite launches is ten minutes the shorter the better for us anyway let's be as careful as possible of course time to launch our baby elephant yep just like the first satellite the same size the same look Yeah right just without the external antennas the first one had taking position I'm ready with the Mirrorball but he noted go this one went the best well it's the shape of a ball so it flies smoothly like a ball right yeah president of malaria I congratulate the people who invented it it gives everyone an opportunity to see it for themselves and I'm sure that the more people who have a chance to spacewalk even if it is in VR and see for themselves just help beautiful our planet is then the more they'll want to cherish it and to live in peace and harmony this is such a great project you've been out there for over an hour how are you feeling what about the temperature everything okay yeah great okay then let's take a break I'll time three minutes and then we'll continue okay good miss you together we're better what there's no better way to explain why we work in space the way you do together we are better
