1
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:09,780
The Roman Catholic Church has been banned
in China for more than 60 years.

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,960
Now, the Vatican is trying
to change that.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,430
Here’s a look at
why an agreement

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,920
between the Chinese
government and the Vatican

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,880
would be controversial.
China severed ties

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,260
with the Vatican in 1951.

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,410
That was shortly after the
Communist Party took power.

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,620
China then formed the Chinese
Catholic Patriotic Association,

9
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,450
which isn’t recognized
by the Vatican

10
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,970
so it has to choose its own
bishops.

11
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:38,150
Catholics loyal to Rome 
started an “underground” church.

12
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,670
This has left more than 10
million Chinese Catholics

13
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,110
with two options.

14
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,690
Worship in unofficial
“house churches,”

15
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,670
or pray in state-sanctioned churches

16
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,610
run by non-ordained
clergy members.

17
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:53,030
The underground community has
faced ongoing persecution.

18
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,060
Vatican-appointed bishops
have been thrown in jail,

19
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,000
and their churches
have been demolished.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,200
Other popes, including John Paul II 
and Benedict XVI,

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,120
tried but failed
to open a dialogue

22
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,620
with the Chinese government.

23
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,200
Now, Pope Francis is
considering giving Beijing

24
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,620
a say in the ordination
of bishops in China.

25
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,570
The negotiations are
angering Catholics

26
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,820
who feel the pope is
conceding too much

27
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,410
to the communist government.

28
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,750
Cardinal Joseph Zen has
been vocal in his dissent.

29
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,820
The government is free
to make any choice they like.

30
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:30,390
They are not going to make a 
good choice for the church.

31
00:01:30,390 --> 00:00:00,000
They understand only politics.
