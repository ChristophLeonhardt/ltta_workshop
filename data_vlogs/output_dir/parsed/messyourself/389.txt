shit oh man this game looks so stunning
Jesus Christ man I've been waiting for
this caper so long okay okay now I
believe it's a cutscene up here if you
guys want to skip the cutscene I'll
leave a time frame somewhere on screen
okay ladies German oh hello anyone here
guys Diana
justic isn't it I'm Diana died I'll take
you to your quarters someone likes to
keep secrets
Oh rose our stock and trade besides from
what I hear you have a few of your own
I'm not like you in case you're
wondering I'm in a handler program
agents and handlers work in unity you
know the expression know your enemy well
that part is my job
is only half the victory I know oh you
also need to know yourself I'm working
on it
I read your case file impressive work
partly textbook but I suppose fieldwork
never is tell me what did it feel like
taking lives Oh
random res of it you sorted is that why
you came here why you let us test you
maybe I'm not the only one being tested
oh it might be smart we are here
basic training starts at over 600 hours
Oh 600 lessons leave you to prepare piss
off I'm not getting up at 6 o'clock Oh
600 hours my ass
oh shit more cutscenes are you sure
about this I am there are no second
chances miss Byrne would not either I
choose him may I inquire why a blank
slate antisocial apathetic and
unresponsive no doubt the boy shows
promise but perhaps I see possibility
where others see limitation isn't that
what a handle does sir
we'll see anyone can kill miss burn
would he still remembers nothing if he
does he's not sharing we will check up
on his story the hospital in Romania in
the meantime keep him under close watch
the hospital in Romania ah welcome to
advanced training oh here we go your
first mission originally took place in
Sydney Australia oh the target was
Calvin Ritter also known as the sparrow
or master thief for hire specializing in
rare and priceless art our agent
cleverly infiltrated Ritter's private
yacht during a social gathering and
discreetly eliminated him without any of
the guests noticing nice now you will do
the same oh and don't worry about the
training operatives all weapons are
simulated good luck in issues oh so this
is like a training level oh yeah primary
objective eliminate Calvin Ritter bloody
Calvin Ritter it max bloody well coming
for you is so now with every hitman game
there is multiple ways of completing
this level alright so the first
objective we have is to find
an outfit okay so we can go behind this
area and find a disguise here oh we are
trespassing be very quiet
hitman sneak on by easy hello dockworker
are you doing
we can now disguise ourselves as a
mechanic oh yeah you put on his clothes
that's the first might just work though
Oh
people do tend to see uniforms not faces
yeah cautious though some people are
more observant than others
not bad initiate thank you we can now
enter the yacht but you see that guy
with the white dot on his head he will
see through our disguise so we need to
be very careful don't see me don't see
me easy oh hi guys hey you please stop
oh sorry I thought I was being sneaky
excuse me are you on drugs
hahaha I am on in the kabbala drugs
actually you know I piss off your stupid
guards alright so mean alright so we
have now entered the yacht okay let's
locate Calvin Ritter
listen what would you call me listen
shut up bitch I will bloody kill you up
okay we have located Calvin Ritter now
we just need to bloody kill luma why are
you trying to hide
listen don't bloody sass me again I will
kill you the gallery eh hmm
Oh throwing items throwing blood items
at people will knock them out not kill
them oh okay that sounds fun
oh there's a hammer here how convenient
hello sir that's what you bloody get oh
shit look at his arm
is that oh shit I don't feel too good
listen you bloody gate all right I will
bloody tickle disguise ah yeah okay
unlike mechanics the cabin crew is
allowed upstairs access I see what
you're getting at very unorthodox I like
it yeah okay let's drag his body and
dump it in the bloody freezer oh yeah we
are now disguised as the cabin crew babe
it looks like Calvin Rita is got a
meeting with this guy okay lalalalala
cleaning this bar that's made of like
plain wood Lana Lana laughs oh shit
covered which is on the move
all right let's follow him I forget that
this is all like a simulation look this
is all like fake this is just the test
okay I mean it's not a test it's real
life are you doing a good shut up you
bloody gay all right Calvin Rita is
entering there but we are not allowed
there so we need to UM go through this
door but we need to make a distraction
okay pick up this bust and throw it over
that yeah what was that
just help me to throw something I don't
know but let's break up with a storm
quickly don't see me no see me oh my god
didn't say how they Oh equip the
silenced pistol oh yeah baby okay
eliminate the target wait before I do
that though even more yeah okay no gir
your target is down now head towards an
exit that's
how you do a baby Hitman style now we
can end the mission baby challenge
complete yeah we did it baby
but god damn did it how did you know I
told you he had talent his stats are off
the charts psy skills and reflexes they
can only be the result of previous
training power like that with no moral
restraint it could be dangerous I
thought that was rather the points that
all agents have weak spots miss Byrne
would normally pressure points to keep
them in check but this one
perhaps it would be better to just what
give me a Tillman Oh give him a chance
give me a try we'll take full
responsibility listen to Diana you
bloody girl it's your show he was gonna
kill me he was like it's gonna be better
off it kill me
welcome back initiate okay as an ICA
agent every challenge you face can be
overcome in multiple ways yeah complete
this exercise again this time attacking
it from a different angle
Oh vary your strategy improvise yeah
watching here we go baby
okay so now we're gonna replay the
mission but there are several ways to
kill Calvin Ritter which we are going to
do right now so if we go on to
challenges it will show us all of the
ways that we can kill Calvin Ritter by
so we can kill Calvin by using rat
poison we can also kill Calvin by
disguising ourselves as mr. Norfolk the
guy that he just met for that secret
meeting we can also kill him by drowning
him in the toilet also we can
assassinate him using explosives babe it
can't wait to do that and lastly we can
kill Calvin using something very
secretive up above the boat but we will
get into that zone all right now the
first thing I want to try out is killing
Calvin using the rat poison
the rat poison is located just over here
food and drink can be poisoned oh yeah
okay so we're gonna put this rat poison
in his bloody drink all right we're
gonna be quick about this there's a
glass of wine here poison it with a rat
poison all right now I think this is
Calvin Ritter's drink but we just need
to wait on Calvin drink the drink
oh is he doing it he's doing it he's
drinking the drink
stop letting in oh my good he's
triggered the drink is he gonna die wait

you close it all he's throwing up
I did it I did it I did it I drowned
them and then poopoo ha ha ha
that's just great banter it's it's just
great banter
all right the chance we're gonna do now
is we're can disguise ourselves as mr.
Norfolk now I don't have to do this so
it should be fun to find out so here is
mr. Norfolk
looking at bloody texting hey babe can I
come over tonight no go away mister no

people all right so let's meet him up

drink so that's how we get him away from

use in emergency situations what does
that mean if we go on the top floor they
have these emergency rafts here
