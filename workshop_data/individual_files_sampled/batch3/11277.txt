now it is exactly a month since Artie America had to register as a foreign agent in the US after been pressured by the authorities at the time the State Department did assure us it wouldn't affect Artie's ability to cover the news but a couple of weeks later we had our press credentials revoked by the US Congress Samira Khan asked the State Department to clarify the situation when Artie was forced to register as a foreign agent you said that it wouldn't inhibit our ability to report when the United States tells someone to register under a foreign agent requirement we don't impact or affect the ability of them to report news and information we just have them register it's as simple as that just a couple of weeks ago our press credentials were revoked so doesn't this contradict your earlier statements I think I think pressed credentials may have been revoked by Congress and not necessarily the members of Congress but rather the association of reporters that handles who gets to come in and cover Congress after basically directing my question to Congress she played the Russian card and dubbed me a representative of the Russian government in fact the fact that you are here as a representative of the Russian government is a perfect example of how we do not restrict any type of freedom of the press this all comes after RT America was forced to register as a foreign agent dead stripped of their Capitol Hill press credentials only after Russia was accused of meddling in the u.s. presidential election after Washington's measures Russia actually designated several media outlets funded by the US government as foreign agents but it seems after this whole exchange that the State Department is unwilling to keep its word and is now trying to just shift blame to avoid taking and responsibility American reporting were media and legal analyst Lionel thinks that Artie was targeted as part of a blame game against Russia what does that mean well it wasn't necessarily revoked by Congress or members of Congress but the Association selected by the members of Congress to determine who covers Congress what does this is doublespeak you know exactly what the question was why did you revoke our press credentials why that was the question Russia TV our TV was yanked because it's Russian whether you're Russian own 80% were there Russian media it's the teach you a lesson it's part of this nonsense that started when people were trying to figure out a way to explain a way that Hillary Clinton lost the election and when they didn't have anybody to blame they picked Russia so it just kept building and everything that's questions no foreign agent this is an espionage statute from 1938 what is this you know walking right in a trench coat with a newspaper with holes in it like a spy oh come on this is embarrassing
