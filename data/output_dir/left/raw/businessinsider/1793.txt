00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,540
that's a satisfying sound isn't it what

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,440
could get<font color="#E5E5E5"> better than that huh</font>

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:18,779
refreshing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lacroix see this was always a</font>

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:21,480
subject<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some debate when we were</font>

00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:47,410
early adopter of Lucroy I had it first

it's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff is what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I like</font>

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,050
about it is that it looks and tastes

15
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,300
like a premium product but you're paying

16
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,540
way less for it then say Perrier

17
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,380
but you mean the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cottage is the best</font>

18
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,899
hands down it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right level about</font>

firecrackers bouncing off<font color="#CCCCCC"> my tongue it's</font>

23
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:33,340
really enjoyable a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these waters</font>

24
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,610
have a really artificial flavor but with

25
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">Lacroix it actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tastes like what it</font>

says on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottle like if it's</font>

28
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:47,049
just tangerine juice essentially mixed

29
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:49,240
in with the water it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just packs a</font>

you're drinking when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're drinking it</font>

32
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,030
sometimes for other other brands you'll

33
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,350
drink it and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not exactly quite</font>

34
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,270
sure and then you're like okay I see

41
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,410
can of seltzer so when you're drinking

00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,720
it walking around<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a flashy CAD it's</font>

43
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,820
beautifully done and they ask and it's

44
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,590
like a focal<font color="#CCCCCC"> point and talking point of</font>

45
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,060
conversation like what are you drinking

46
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,380
where did you find that one of the most

00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">fun things about Lacroix is when you</font>

stock up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I say stock up I mean</font>

49
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,450
you get every single different flavor

50
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,710
you put in your fridge Raider and it

51
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,390
looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a rainbow there's this cult</font>

52
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:34,030
surrounding Lacroix and I just remember

53
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,040
the day so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a lot simpler and you</font>

54
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,960
could just drink it for the enjoyment of

it it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not taste of the internet a</font>

56
00:02:40,960 --> 00:00:00,000
taste of a more innocent and simpler
