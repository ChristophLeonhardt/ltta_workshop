30
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,184

THIS IS ALL COMING, OF COURSE, 

39
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,695
AS THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 

40
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:04,164
ROUNDLY CRITICIZED FOR DOING 

41
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:04,763
EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID HE WOULD 

42
00:01:04,763 --> 00:01:06,833
NEVER DO.

NICE, NEW, SMART MISSILES WILL

00:01:17,276 --> 00:01:19,111
BE COMING.

00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:19,912
INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT HE SAYS

00:01:19,912 --> 00:01:21,214

51
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:24,384

THE PRESIDENT.

55
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,823
SECRETARY MATTIS IS OVER AT THE 

56
00:01:30,823 --> 00:01:31,191
PENTAGON.

57
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,291
THE PRESIDENT ADDRESSING THE 

58
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:41,868
NATION FROM THE DIPLOMATIC ROOM.

59
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:51,211
>> MY FELLOW AMERICANS, B A 

60
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:51,845
SHORT TIME AGO, I ORDERED THE 

61
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:56,449
UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES TO 

62
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,651
LAUNCH PRECISION STRIKES ON 

63
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:00,086
TARGETS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 

64
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:03,656
CHEMICAL WEAPONS CAPABILITIES OF

65
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:07,794
SYRIAN DICTATOR BASHAR AL ASSAD.

66
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:11,164
A COMBINED OPERATION WITH THE 

67
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,499
ARMED FORCES OF FRANCE AND THE 

68
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:15,801
UNITED KINGDOM IS NOW UNDER WAY.

69
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:18,404
WE THANK THEM BOTH.

70
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:20,139
TONIGHT, I WANT TO SPEAK WITH 

71
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:23,876
YOU ABOUT WHY WE HAVE TAKEN THIS

72
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:24,109
ACTION.

73
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:29,315
ONE YEAR AGO, ASSAD LAUNCHED A 

74
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,285
SAVAGE CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK 

75
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,887
AGAINST HIS OWN INNOCENT PEOPLE.

76
00:02:34,887 --> 00:02:38,324
THE UNITED STATES RESPONDED WITH

77
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,026
58 MISSILE STRIKES THAT 

78
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:44,697
DESTROYED 20% OF THE SYRIAN AIR 

79
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:45,531
FORCE.

80
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:50,670
LAST SATURDAY, THE ASSAD REGIME 

81
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,771
DEPLOYED CHEMICAL WEAPONS TO 

82
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:52,805
SLAUGHTER INNOCENT CIVILIANS 

83
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:55,708
THIS TIME IN THE TOWN OF DOUMA 

84
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,777
NEAR THE SYRIAN CAPITAL OF 

85
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:58,478
DAMASCUS.

86
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:01,247
THIS MASSACRE WAS A SIGNIFICANT 

87
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,581
ESCALATION IN A PATTERN OF 

88
00:03:02,581 --> 00:03:06,686
CHEMICAL WEAPONS USE BY THAT 

89
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,489
VERY TERRIBLE REGIME.

90
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:12,124
THE EVIL AND THE DESPICABLE 

91
00:03:12,124 --> 00:03:14,360
ATTACK LEFT MOTHERS AND FATHERS,

92
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,995
INFANTS AND CHILDREN, THRASHING 

93
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:20,133
IN PAIN AND GASPING FOR AIR.

94
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:24,170
THESE ARE NOT THE ACTIONS OF A 

95
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,272
MAN, THEY ARE CRIMES OF A 

96
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:29,042
MONSTER INSTEAD.

97
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,512
FOLLOWING THE HORRORS OF WORLD 

98
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,481
WAR I A CENTURY AGO, CIVILIZED 

99
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:39,552
NATIONS JOINED TOGETHER TO BAN 

100
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,420
CHEMICAL WARFARE.

101
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,021
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ARE UNIQUELY 

102
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,757
DANGEROUS NOT ONLY BECAUSE THEY 

103
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:46,859
INFLICT GRUESOME SUFFERING, BUT 

104
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:51,297
BECAUSE EVEN SMALL AMOUNTS CAN 

105
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,366
UNLEASH WIDESPREAD DEVASTATION.

106
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,768
THE PURPOSE OF OUR ACTIONS 

107
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:58,438
TONIGHT IS TO ESTABLISH A STRONG

108
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,939
DETERRENT AGAINST THE 

109
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,774
PRODUCTION, SPREAD, AND USE OF 

110
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:04,444
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

111
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,746
ESTABLISHING THIS DETERRENT IS A

112
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:07,580
VITAL NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST

113
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,017
OF THE UNITED STATES.

114
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,252
THE COMBINED AMERICAN, BRITISH, 

115
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:16,422
AND FRENCH RESPONSE TO THESE 

116
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,225
ATROCITIES WILL INTEGRATE ALL 

117
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,761
INSTRUMENTS OF OUR NATIONAL 

118
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:27,133
POWER, MILITARY, ECONOMIC, AND 

119
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:27,433
DIPLOMATIC.

120
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,103
WE ARE PREPARED TO SUSTAIN THIS 

121
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,606
RESPONSE UNTIL THE SYRIAN REGIME

122
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,107
STOPS ITS USE OF PROHIBITED 

123
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:36,408
CHEMICAL AGENTS.

124
00:04:36,408 --> 00:04:39,178
I ALSO HAVE A MESSAGE TONIGHT 

125
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:40,412
FOR THE TWO GOVERNMENTS MOST 

126
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:44,083
RESPONSIBLE FOR SUPPORTING, 

127
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,918
EQUIPPING AND FINANCING THE 

128
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,122
CRIMINAL ASSAD REGIME.

129
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,358
TO IRAN AND TO RUSSIA, I ASK, 

130
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:54,961
WHAT KIND OF A NATION WANTS TO 

131
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,496
BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE MASS 

132
00:04:57,496 --> 00:05:01,233
MURDER OF INNOCENT MEN, WOMEN, 

133
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:02,034
AND CHILDREN?

134
00:05:02,034 --> 00:05:05,104
THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD CAN BE 

135
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:07,740
JUDGED BY THE FRIENDS THEY KEEP.

136
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,545
NO NATION CAN SUCCEED IN THE 

137
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:15,882
LONG RUN BY PROMOTING ROGUE 

138
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,517
STATES, BRUTAL TYRANTS AND 

139
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,385
MURDEROUS DICTATORS.

140
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:21,554
IN 2013 PRESIDENT PUTIN AND HIS 

141
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:22,555
GOVERNMENT PROMISED THE WORLD 

142
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:25,525
THAT THEY WOULD GUARANTEE THE 

143
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,828
ELIMINATION OF SYRIA'S CHEMICAL 

144
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:29,529
WEAPONS.

145
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,698
ASSAD'S RECENT ATTACK AND 

146
00:05:32,698 --> 00:05:34,900
TODAY'S RESPONSE ARE THE DIRECT 

147
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,503
RESULT OF RUSSIA'S FAILURE TO 

148
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,306
KEEP THAT PROMISE.

149
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,041
RUSSIA MUST DECIDE IF IT WILL 

150
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:46,445
CONTINUE DOWN THIS DARK PATH OR 

151
00:05:46,445 --> 00:05:48,848
IF IT WILL JOIN WITH CIVILIZED 

152
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,617
NATIONS AS A FORCE FOR STABILITY

153
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:52,385
AND PEACE.

154
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:53,552
HOPEFULLY SOMEDAY WE'LL GET 

155
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:56,923
ALONG WITH RUSSIA AND MAYBE EVEN

156
00:05:56,923 --> 00:06:00,259
IRAN, BUT MAYBE NOT.

157
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,427
I WILL SAY THIS.

158
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,629
THE UNITED STATES HAS A LOT TO 

159
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:03,829
OFFER.

160
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:06,465
WITH THE GREATEST AND MOST 

161
00:06:06,465 --> 00:06:08,067
POWERFUL ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY 

162
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:14,240
OF THE WORLD, IN SYRIA, THE 

163
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,474
UNITED STATES, WITH BUT A SMALL 

164
00:06:15,474 --> 00:06:17,443
FORCE BEING USED TO ELIMINATE 

165
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:20,346
WHAT IS LEFT OF ISIS IS DOING 

166
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:24,484
WHAT IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE

167
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:25,017
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

168
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:28,521
OVER THE LAST YEAR, NEARLY 100% 

169
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:31,424
OF THE TERRITORY ONCE CONTROLLED

170
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:34,494
BY THE SO-CALLED ISIS CALIPHATE 

171
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,329
IN SYRIA AND IRAQ HAS BEEN 

172
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:40,233
LIBERATED AND ELIMINATED.

173
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,667
THE UNITED STATES HAS ALSO 

174
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,468
REBUILT OUR FRIENDSHIPS ACROSS 

175
00:06:43,468 --> 00:06:45,004
THE MIDDLE EAST.

176
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,639
WE HAVE ASKED OUR PARTNERS TO 

177
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,275
TAKE GREATER RESPONSIBILITY FOR 

178
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:52,478
SECURING THEIR HOME REGION 

179
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,546
INCLUDING CONTRIBUTING LARGE 

180
00:06:54,546 --> 00:06:57,450
AMOUNTS OF MONEY FOR THE 

181
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,218
RESOURCES, EQUIPMENT AND ALL OF 

182
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:03,756
THE ANTI-ISIS EFFORT.

183
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:04,757
INCREASED ENGAGEMENT FROM OUR 

184
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,326
FRIENDS INCLUDING SAUDI ARABIA, 

185
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:11,163
THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, QATAR,

186
00:07:11,163 --> 00:07:12,765
EGYPT, AND OTHERS, CAN ENSURE 

187
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,100
THAT IRAN DOES NOT PROFIT FROM 

188
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,871
PR THE ERADICATION OF ISIS.

189
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:21,473
AMERICA DOES NOT SEEK AN 

190
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:25,511
INDEFINITE PRESENCE IN SYRIA 

191
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:26,812
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES.

192
00:07:26,812 --> 00:07:29,782
AS OTHER NATIONS STEP UP THEIR 

193
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,016
CONTRIBUTIONS, WE LOOK FORWARD 

194
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:35,454
TO THE DAY WHEN WE CAN BRING OUR

195
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:36,922
WARRIORS HOME AND GREAT 

196
00:07:36,922 --> 00:07:40,293
WARRIORS, THEY ARE.

197
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,495
LOOKING AROUND OUR VERY TROUBLED

198
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,497
WORLD, AMERICANS HAVE NO 

199
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:44,931
ILLUSIONS.

200
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:48,601
WE CANNOT PURGE THE WORLD OF 

201
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:53,439
EVIL OR ACT EVERYWHERE THERE IS 

202
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:53,672
TYRANNY.

203
00:07:53,672 --> 00:07:55,240
NO AMOUNT OF AMERICAN BLOOD OR 

204
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,742
TREASURE CAN PRODUCE LASTING 

205
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,644
PEACE AND SECURITY IN THE MIDDLE

206
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,011
EAST.

207
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,480
IT'S A TROUBLED PLACE.

208
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,715
WE WILL TRY TO MAKE IT BETTER, 

209
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:07,687
BUT IT IS A TROUBLED PLACE.

210
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:08,254
THE UNITED STATES WILL BE A 

211
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,622
PARTNER AND A FRIEND, BUT THE 

212
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:12,824
FATE OF THE REGION LIES IN THE 

213
00:08:12,824 --> 00:08:15,328
HANDS OF ITS OWN PEOPLE.

214
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,530
IN THE LAST CENTURY, WE LOOKED 

215
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,833
STRAIGHT INTO THE DARKEST PLACES

216
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,767
OF THE HUMAN SOUL.

217
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:25,137
WE SAW THE ANGUISH THAT CAN BE 

218
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:28,907
UNLEASHED AND THE EVIL THAT CAN 

219
00:08:28,907 --> 00:08:29,341
TAKE HOLD.

220
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:33,946
BY THE END OF WORLD WAR I, MORE 

221
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:37,383
THAN 1 MILLION PEOPLE HAD BEEN 

222
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:40,519
KILLED OR INJURED BY CHEMICAL 

223
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:40,751
WEAPONS.

224
00:08:40,751 --> 00:08:46,192
WE NEVER WANT TO SEE THAT 

225
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,326
GHASTLY SPECTER RETURN.

226
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:48,527
SO TODAY, THE NATIONS OF 

227
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:50,596
BRITAIN, FRANCE, AND THE UNITED 

228
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:56,936
STATES OF AMERICA, HAVE 

229
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:57,570
MARSHALLED THEIR RIGHTEOUS POWER

230
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,338
AGAINST BARBARISM AND BRUTALITY.

231
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:00,339
 TONIGHT I ASK ALL AMERICANS TO 

232
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,141
SAY A PRAYER FOR OUR NOBLE 

233
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,510
WARRIORS AND OUR ALLIES AS THEY 

234
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,078
CARRY OUT THEIR MISSIONS.

235
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,447
WE PRAY THAT GOD WILL BRING 

236
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:10,516
COMFORT TO THOSE SUFFERING IN 

237
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:10,749
SYRIA.

238
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:13,486
WE PRAY THAT GOD WILL GUIDE THE 

239
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,955
WHOLE REGION TOWARD A FUTURE OF 

240
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,390
DIGNITY AND OF PEACE.

241
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,226
AND WE PRAY THAT GOD WILL 

242
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,529
CONTINUE TO WATCH OVER AND BLESS

243
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,697
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

244
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:28,501
THANK YOU, AND GOOD NIGHT.

245
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,503
THANK YOU.

246
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,637
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP ADDRESSING 

247
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:32,838
THE NATION TONIGHT, REVEALING TO

248
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:35,241
THE NATION WE HAVE NOW LAUNCHED 

249
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,109
PRECISION STRIKES ON SYRIA AIMED

250
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,343
AT THEIR CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

251
00:09:38,343 --> 00:09:40,312
HE REVEALED THIS IS A COMBINED 

252
00:09:40,312 --> 00:09:41,881
OPERATION OF BOTH THE U.S., THE 

253
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:42,347
UK, AND FRANCE.

254
00:09:42,347 --> 00:09:43,816
HE'D BEEN COMMUNICATING WITH 

255
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:45,151
LEADERS OF BOTH COUNTRIES 

256
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,218
THROUGHOUT THE WEEK.

257
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,387
HE TALKED ABOUT PRESIDENT ASSAD 

258
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:49,688
IN SYRIA SAYING THESE ARE THE 

259
00:09:49,688 --> 00:09:51,624
CRIMES OF A MONSTER, DESCRIBING 

260
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:54,193
THE MOTHERS, THE CHILDREN, THE 

261
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,894
PARENTS WE SAW IN THOSE IMAGES 

262
00:09:55,894 --> 00:09:56,629
GASPING FOR AIR.

263
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:57,762
I WANT TO BRING IN OUR CHIEF 

264
00:09:57,762 --> 00:10:00,099
GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT 

265
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,433
MARTHA RADDATZ WHO'S BEEN 

266
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:02,968
MONITORING THIS ALL WEEK.

267
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:04,470
NOW THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH 

268
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,004
TONIGHT, MARCIA.

269
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:05,638
WHAT KIND OF STRIKE IS UNDER WAY

270
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,239
AT THIS HOUR.

271
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,507
HE'S REVEALED HE'S WORKING WITH 

272
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:09,475
ALLIES BOTH FROM THE UK AND FROM

273
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:10,676
FRANCE TONIGHT.

274
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,378
>> HE CERTAINLY IS.

275
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,411
AND THERE ARE WARPLANES IN THE 

276
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:15,347
AREA AND WARSHIPS AS WELL.

277
00:10:15,347 --> 00:10:16,882
THE WORDS HE USED WERE THEY 

278
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:20,019
WOULD GO AFTER CHEMICAL WEAPONS 

279
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:20,352
CAPABILITIES.

280
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:21,820
AND I THINK THAT COULD BE 

281
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,656
ANYTHING FROM AIRFIELDS TO 

282
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:24,090
AIRCRAFT.

283
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,524
THEY BELIEVE THESE CHEMICAL 

284
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,559
WEAPONS WERE DELIVERED FROM 

285
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:29,962
BARREL BOMBS, FROM HELICOPTERS.

286
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,264
SO THEY WILL CERTAINLY GO AFTER 

287
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:32,698
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

288
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,166
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE ALL 

289
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,335
BEEN WATCHING, DAVID, THIS WEEK,

290
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,370
IS HOW STRONG AN IMPACT IT WILL 

291
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:38,570
HAVE.

292
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:42,475
LAST YEAR, THEY DID BOMB THAT 

293
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,709
AIRFIELD AND WITHIN DAYS IT WAS 

294
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,111
WORKING ONCE AGAIN.

295
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,278
THERE WERE AIRPLANES LAUNCHED.

296
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:47,947
SO WHAT THEY WENT AFTER TONIGHT,

297
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,482
WE DON'T KNOW YET.

298
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,717
THE PENTAGON WILL HAVE A PRESS 

299
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,919
BRIEFING IN ABOUT 45 MINUTES AND

300
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,054
FILL US IN ON EXACTLY WHAT WAS 

301
00:10:56,054 --> 00:10:58,724
HIT AND HOW STRONG AN IMPACT 

302
00:10:58,724 --> 00:10:59,792
THEY THINK IT WILL HAVE.

303
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:03,062
ONE OF THE THINGS SECRETARY 

304
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,263
MATTIS SAID JUST YESTERDAY WHICH

305
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,631
GIVES YOU SOME IDEA OF WHAT 

306
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:06,999
THEIR CONCERNS WERE IS HE SAID 

307
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,601
WE ARE CONCERNED THAT WE DON'T 

308
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,169
ADD ANY CIVILIAN DEATHS.

309
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,737
WE'RE TRYING TO STOP THE MURDER 

310
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:16,675
OF INNOCENT PEOPLE, BUT ON A 

311
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:17,409
STRATEGIC LEVEL, IT'S HOW DO WE 

312
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:18,076
KEEP THIS FROM ESCALATING OUT OF

313
00:11:18,076 --> 00:11:19,812
CONTROL AND THAT HAS BEEN A REAL

314
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,781
CONCERN OF SECRETARY MATTIS.

315
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,082
HE DOES NOT WANT THIS TO 

316
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:23,349
ESCALATE.

317
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,551
HE DOES NOT WANT IT TO GO BEYOND

318
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:27,352
THE BORDERS.

319
00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:31,157
>> AND MARTHA, AS YOU POINT OUT,

320
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,558
CHEMICAL WEAPONS CAPABILITIES.

321
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:34,159
LET'S BRING IN STEVE TONIGHT 

322
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,728
WHO'S WATCHING THIS UNFOLD WITH 

323
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:39,298
US, RETIRED COLONEL GANIARD.

324
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:40,533
WHAT KIND OF STRIKE DO YOU THINK

325
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,301
IS TAKING PLACE, WILL THIS BE A 

326
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,035
RESCISSION STRIKE IN ONE 

327
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,503
SPECIFIC LOCATION, OR DO YOU 

328
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:46,505
GATHER GIVEN HE TALKED ABOUT 

329
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:48,240
CHEMICAL WEAPONS CAPABILITIES 

330
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,041
THIS COULD BE MULTIPLE SITE 

331
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,009
WE'RE LOOKING AT TONIGHT?

332
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,210
>> DAVID, THIS WAS A COORDINATED

333
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,979
CRUISE MISSILE ATTACK BY THE SEA

334
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,182
AND AIR BY U.S., FRENCH, AND 

335
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,483
BRITISH FORCES AGAINST NUMEROUS 

336
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,351
TARGETS WITHIN SYRIA.

337
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,553
>> NUMEROUS TARGETS.

338
00:12:01,553 --> 00:12:02,354
HOW MANY DO YOU BELIEVE AND WHAT

339
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:03,255
KINDS OF TARGETS?

340
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:04,689
>> WELL, WE'LL WAIT ON DETAILS 

341
00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:06,859
FROM THE PENTAGON, DAVID, BUT AS

342
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,327
MARTHA NOTED RIGHT AT THE TOP OF

343
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,029
THE LIST WILL BE CHEMICAL 

344
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:10,996
WEAPONS STORAGE FACILITIES.

345
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,731
BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE 

346
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:13,665
PRESIDENT ASKED FOR A BROADER 

347
00:12:13,665 --> 00:12:15,067
SET OF TARGETS THIS TIME.

348
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,902
HE WANTS TO DEAL A CRIPPLING 

349
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,904
BLOW TO THE ASSAD REGIME.

350
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,940
SO WE MAY SEE INFRASTRUCTURE BUT

351
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,843
ALSO SEE MILITARY COMMAND AND 

352
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:24,310
CONTROL, INTELLIGENCE 

353
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,046
HEADQUARTERS, AND DAVID, IF YOU 

354
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:32,885
LOOK OUT THERE TO THE EAST OF 

355
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:33,418
DAM

356
00:12:33,418 --> 00:12:35,553
DAMASCUS AT DUMARY AIR BASE, 

357
00:12:35,553 --> 00:12:38,123
WHERE THE ATTACK ON DOUMA CAME 

358
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:38,323
FROM.

359
00:12:38,323 --> 00:12:39,257
THAT AIRFIELD WILL LIKELY BE ON 

360
00:12:39,257 --> 00:12:41,860
THE LIST OF TARGETS TONIGHT. 

361
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,095
>> COLONEL, YOU HEARD THE 

362
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,163
PRESIDENT TALK ABOUT THE U.S. 

363
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,563
STRIKE JUST ABOUT A YEAR AGO.

364
00:12:45,563 --> 00:12:50,135
MARTHA POINTED OUT THAT THE 

365
00:12:50,135 --> 00:12:51,970
AIRSTRIP WAS BEING USED 

366
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,004
LITERALLY WITHIN DAYS OF THE 

367
00:12:53,004 --> 00:12:53,238
STRIKE.

368
00:12:53,238 --> 00:12:55,908
DO YOU GATHER THE STRIKE THIS 

369
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:56,809
TIME AROUND OR SERIES OF STRIKES

370
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,510
WILL BE FAR MORE POTENT?

371
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,546
>> I THINK IT WILL HAVE TO BE.

372
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:01,513
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE HAD TO 

373
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:03,015
MAKE A STATEMENT AND THE 

374
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:04,449
STATEMENT WE MADE LAST TIME WAS 

375
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:05,718
NOTHING MORE THAN A WARNING.

376
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,353
I THINK THIS TIME WHAT'S 

377
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,220
INTERESTING IF YOU NOTE THESE 

378
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,322
RINGS ON THE MAP HERE, THESE ARE

379
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:12,291
RINGS THAT REPRESENT THE MAXIMUM

380
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,360
EFFECTIVE RANGE OF TWO VERY 

381
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,261
SOPHISTICATED RUSSIAN SURFACE TO

382
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,496
AIR MISSILE SYSTEMS THAT 

383
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,999
MILITARY PLANNERS ARE TRYING TO 

384
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,332
HAVE TO AVOID.

385
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:20,966
THEY DON'T KNOW IF THE RUSSIANS 

386
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:25,004
ARE GOING TO TRY TO SHOOT DOWN 

387
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,472
THE ALLIIED CRUISE MISSILES IN 

388
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:26,705
FLIGHT.

389
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,707
MILITARY PLANNERS HAVE HAD TO 

390
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,676
FLY THE MISSILES LOW THROUGH THE

391
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:31,643
MOUNTAINS OF LEBANON TO GET TO 

392
00:13:31,643 --> 00:13:33,212
THEIR TARGETS IN DAMASCUS, 

393
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:33,779
LITERALLY FLYING UNDER THE 

394
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,649
RADAR.

395
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,717
>> YEAH, WE SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW 

396
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,286
AT THIS HOUR IF THE RUSSIANS 

397
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,353
WILL TAKE COUNTERMEASURES THOUGH

398
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:42,387
THEY THREATENED TO DO SO EARLIER

399
00:13:42,387 --> 00:13:45,491
IN THE WEEK.

400
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,761
I WANT TO BRING IN OUR SENIOR 

401
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:49,495
FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT WITH US 

402
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,829
FROM ENGLAND.

403
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,197
YOU HEARD PRESIDENT TRUMP SINGLE

404
00:13:52,197 --> 00:13:54,199
OUT RUSSIA AND IRAN, BUT IN 

405
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:55,367
PARTICULAR VLADIMIR PUTIN.

406
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:56,869
HE TALKED ABOUT HOW IT WAS 

407
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:57,669
RUSSIA'S RESPONSIBILITY TO 

408
00:13:57,669 --> 00:13:58,904
GUARANTEE THAT THOSE CHEMICAL 

409
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:03,575
WEAPONS WOULD NOT BE

410
00:14:03,575 --> 00:14:04,543
LONGER IN SYRIA.

411
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,177
YET WE WITNESSED THIS ATTACK IN 

412
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,512
THE LAST WEEK.

413
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,214
>> LET'S NOT FORGET, ABOUT, 

414
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:09,814
PRESIDENT OBAMA DREW HIS RED 

415
00:14:09,814 --> 00:14:10,816
LINE IT WAS RUSSIA THAT ACTED AS

416
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:16,387
AGUARANTOR.

417
00:14:16,387 --> 00:14:18,624
THE ACCUSATION TONIGHT IS IT 

418
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,693
DIDN'T HOLD TRUE TO ITS WORD.

419
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,295
HOWEVER, THERE SEEMED TO BE AN 

420
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:25,364
OLIVE BRANCH TO IRAN AND RUSSIA.

421
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,132
WASN'T QUITE AS HARD LINE AS THE

422
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:28,100
TWEETS WE SAW EARLIER.

423
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,467
TALKING OF TWEETS WE'RE SEEING 

424
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:30,769
EARLY SOUNDS OF PEOPLE REPORTING

425
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,004
SOUNDS OF EXPLOSIONS AROUND 

426
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,071
DIFFERENT PARTS OF DAMASCUS AND 

427
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:35,507
OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.

428
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:36,541
THIS EVENING NONE OF THAT IS 

429
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,877
VERIFIED AT THE MOMENT, BUT AS 

430
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:40,879
COLONEL GANIARD SUGGESTED, THIS 

431
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,714
IS GOING TO BE A BIGGER ATTACK, 

432
00:14:42,714 --> 00:14:43,915
BIGGER STRIKE THAN WE SAW ONE 

433
00:14:43,915 --> 00:14:44,350
YEAR AGO.

434
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,851
I MEAN, IT HAS TO BE IF IT'S 

435
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:46,585
GOING TO TRY AND ACHIEVE THEIR 

436
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:49,488
OBJECTIVE.

437
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:53,492
>> LIKELY A LARGE LAR ATTACK THA

438
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:53,759
YEAR AGO.

439
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:54,193
OUR THANKS TO YOU.

440
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:58,130
I WANT TO BRING IN CECILIA VEGA.

441
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:58,964
YOU'VE BEEN AT THE WHITE HOUSE 

442
00:14:58,964 --> 00:14:59,732
ALL WEEK.

443
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,532
EARLIER THIS WEEK PRESIDENT 

444
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,233
TRUMP SENT OUT THE TWEET SAYING 

445
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:03,502
MISSILES WERE COMING TO BE 

446
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,571
READY, THEY'D BE NICE, NEW, 

447
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,772
SMART.

448
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:07,940
HE WAS CRITICIZING FOR 

449
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,907
TELEGRAPHING TO THE WORLD WHAT 

450
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:10,442
WAS COMING WHEN HE SAID SO OFTEN

451
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:11,176
DURING THE CAMPAIGN HE'D NEVER 

452
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:11,743
DO THAT.

453
00:15:11,743 --> 00:15:13,145
THERE SEEMED TO BE A BIT OF A 

454
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,113
SLOWDOWN AS THE WEEK PROGRESSED 

455
00:15:15,113 --> 00:15:17,049
AS HE BEGAN TALKING WITH 

456
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,250
SECRETARY MATTIS AND OTHER 

457
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,451
MEMBERS OF THE TOP SECURITY TEAM

458
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:20,051
IN THE WHITE HOUSE. 

459
00:15:20,051 --> 00:15:21,453
>> Reporter: HE WAS SO ROUNDLY 

460
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:22,588
CRITICIZED, DAVID, FOR DOING 

461
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,889
EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID HE WOULD 

462
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,224
NEVER DO WHICH IS BROADCASTING 

463
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,591
HIS MILITARY PLANS AND AS YOU 

464
00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:27,726
SAID EXACTLY SEEMED TO SORT OF 

465
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:28,693
DIAL THAT BACK.

466
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:29,494
EARLY ON IN THE WEEK THE 

467
00:15:29,494 --> 00:15:31,363
PRESIDENT SAID A DECISION WOULD 

468
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:32,330
BE 24-48 HOURS.

469
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,333
WE ARE NOW DAY FROM THAT.

470
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,134
FINALLY THIS DECISION MADE.

471
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,469
A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WATCHING TO 

472
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:38,704
SEE WHETHER HE WOULD TAKE A HARD

473
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,739
LINE WITH PUTIN AS HE DID OVER 

474
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:41,673
TWITTER AGAIN THIS WEEK NAMING 

475
00:15:41,673 --> 00:15:44,109
HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME BY NAME 

476
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:44,642
CALLING HIM OUT IN HIS 

477
00:15:44,642 --> 00:15:46,779
RELATIONSHIP WITH SYRIA'S BASHAR

478
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,413
AL ASSAD.

479
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:48,514
I GOT TO TELL YOU, DAVID, YOU 

480
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,482
KNOW, ALL OF THIS, OF COURSE, 

481
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:51,283
HAS BEEN FRONT AND CENTER FOR 

482
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:51,683
THIS WHITE HOUSE.

483
00:15:51,683 --> 00:15:54,920
IT COMES VERY MUCH WITH SO MANY 

484
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,988
DISTRACTIONS, WHAT THEY ARE 

485
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,223
DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW.

486
00:15:58,223 --> 00:15:58,991
THIS MAJOR FIGHT BREWING BETWEEN

487
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,659
THE PRESIDENT AND HIS FORMER FBI

488
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,661
DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY.

489
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:03,962
IT'S HARD TO -- IT HAS BEEN 

490
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:05,197
HARD, I THINK, FOR THEM TO 

491
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,898
CONCENTRATE, FOCUS ON SYRIA, 

492
00:16:06,898 --> 00:16:09,968
WITH ALL OF THAT GOING ON IN THE

493
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:10,369
BACKGROUND.

494
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:11,737
>> AND YET THOSE STRIKES HAVE 

495
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,205
BEEN LAUNCHED TONIGHT AS THE 

496
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,207
PRESIDENT BALANCES ALL OF THIS.

497
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,608
CECILIA, OUR THANKS TO YOU AS 

498
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:16,808
WELL.

499
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:17,476
AGAIN, PRESIDENT TRUMP 

500
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,410
ADDRESSING THE NATION JUST A 

501
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,611
SHORT TIME AGO.

502
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,146
REVEALING TO THE COUNTRY THAT WE

503
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,415
HAVE LAUNCHED PRECISION STRIKES 

504
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,484
AGAINST SYRIA AIMED AT 

505
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,451
DECIMATING THEIR CHEMICAL 

506
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:27,986
WEAPONS CAPABILITIES.

507
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:29,188
IT'S BELIEVED THESE STRIKES WILL

508
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:30,456
BE MUCH STRONGER AND THE STRIKES

509
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,824
JUST ABOUT A YEAR AGO.

510
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,992
WE WILL WAIT TO SEE WHAT UNFOLDS

511
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:34,225
TONIGHT.

512
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:35,627
NO REACTION FROM RUSSIA AS OF 

513
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,028
YET, BUT THE PRESIDENT DID 

514
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:38,463
REVEAL THIS IS THE WORK OF NOT 

515
00:16:38,463 --> 00:16:43,135
ONLY THE U.S. MILITARY, BUT THE 

516
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:43,469
UK AND FRANCE.

517
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:44,103
TWO OF OUR STRONGEST ALLIES AT 

518
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,038
WORK TONIGHT IN THE SKIES OVER 

519
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:46,238
SYRIA.

520
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:47,606
I'M DAVID MUIR REPORTING FROM 

521
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:48,907
THE REGION HERE IN BEIRUT.

00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,041
WE WILL HAVE CONTINUING 

523
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:50,943
DEVELOPMENTS ONLINE AND FOR 

524
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,177

FOR THE REST OF YOU, ENJOY THE

00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:57,983

GOOD NIGHT.
