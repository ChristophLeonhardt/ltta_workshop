hey there it is I got a safe alternative
you want luscious lips no surgery this
is what you do no surgery there's a
little bit of a little bit of
marshmallow on your face but hey it
works
there you go he's off see there it is
you'll have to get crazy you just do
that so instead of it's a sucking into a
shot glass perfect it's perfect

facial hair we don't have whoa

Hana Jenna let's comment this one's safe
you'll get organic marshmallows again or
should I even better you better I don't
have an upper lip there we go does it
work Oh flames are burning and that's
what we do so now you don't have to suck
through a shot glass to get those
blushes lifts you just need to apply
some marshmallows to your face nice and
easy no messes well maybe just a tiny
one
um no blood no no no no no natural lunch
from those I love these lips already

look that's the look I'm going for
