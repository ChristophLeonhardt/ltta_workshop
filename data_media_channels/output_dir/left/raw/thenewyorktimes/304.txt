1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,415
[text message sound]

2
00:00:06,115 --> 00:00:08,940
“And that's how you jump out
of an airplane, babe.”

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,730
He told me just because
I’m thousands of miles away,

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,000
like, I will be so
present in your life.

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,740
“Phew, made it safe.”

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,010
He told me that they

7
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,500
were going to not
return to that base —

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,060
different mission.

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,450
I told him I loved him.

10
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,330
Love you too, darling.

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,060
I’ll talk to you as soon as
I get back to base.

12
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,960
“I’ll talk to you later. Bye.”

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,540
And the rest is just a big blur.

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:05,400
When Dustin was in Africa, 
that mailbox was exciting.

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,620
I would skip to it.

16
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,540
He sent four letters.

17
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,990
He gave me one at the
airport when he left.

18
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,700
Every letter after that

19
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,370
came with 30 index cards.

20
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,243
I was supposed to read an
index card every day

21
00:01:19,243 --> 00:01:22,156
when I woke up.

22
00:01:22,156 --> 00:01:24,550
I saw him from across
the crowd with his hat on

23
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,180
and his sweaty shirt.

24
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,470
I said, hey — it’s like, hi.

25
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,610
It’s like — want to dance?

26
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,710
Yes, I do.

27
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,280
It was a feeling that I
never felt with anyone else,

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,350
of just completeness.

29
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,640
I have the original dog tag
that he put around my neck

30
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,960
before he left for
this deployment.

31
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:53,380
This was the week that Dustin
would have been coming home.

32
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,235
His stuff came back from Africa.

33
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:04,300
I found every receipt from
every interaction we had.

34
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:09,729
I found little notes of
things he wanted to tell me.

35
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:14,410
I just wanted my
lips on his lips.

36
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,130
I have all these
wonderful memories.

37
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,580
This grand love story.

38
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:23,830
But all my heart wants is just
him to be on my couch right now,

39
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,330
watching Netflix
and being normal.

40
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,510
I want to make him dinner.

41
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,010
And I want ...

42
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:33,500
That’s all we wanted.

43
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,090
I would love to hear
new words from him.

44
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:44,150
But he gave me a
lot of good stuff.

45
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:49,660
Still to this day, that mailbox
is my favorite thing.

46
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,221
And it’s what haunts me.

47
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,670
“I just read your letter,
and I don't know how you were

48
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:06,280
able to put it in words exactly
how both of us were feeling.

49
00:03:06,280 --> 00:00:00,000
How everything we do for each other
is genuinely real ...”
