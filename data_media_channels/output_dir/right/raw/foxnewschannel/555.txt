LIFE, JULIE.

64
00:01:43,341 --> 00:01:44,542
>> Julie: LET'S TALK APPEALS

65
00:01:44,542 --> 00:01:46,110
PROCESS AS YOU KNOW, OF

66
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,278
COURSE HIS LAWYERS ARE GOING

67
00:01:47,278 --> 00:01:48,446
TO APPEAL THIS BY SENTENCING

68
00:01:48,446 --> 00:01:50,081
HIM TO 3 TO 10 YEARS.

69
00:01:50,081 --> 00:01:52,350
DOES THAT HURT ACE APPEALS

70
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:52,684
PROCESS?

71
00:01:52,684 --> 00:01:55,019
DOES IT MAKE IT HARDER FOR

72
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:56,287
HIS DEFENSE TRYING TO APPEAL

73
00:01:56,287 --> 00:01:57,322
CONSIDERING A MINIMUM OF

74
00:01:57,322 --> 00:01:59,057
THREE YEARS IS NOT NEARLY AS

75
00:01:59,057 --> 00:02:00,258
MUCH AS HE COULD HAVE

76
00:02:00,258 --> 00:02:00,592
SERVED.

77
00:02:00,592 --> 00:02:03,194
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, THE

78
00:02:03,194 --> 00:02:03,995
JUDGE MERGED THE THREE

79
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:05,497
CHARGES THAT HE WAS

80
00:02:05,497 --> 00:02:06,531
CONVICTED OF INTO ONE.

81
00:02:06,531 --> 00:02:07,766
HE COULD HAVE FACED 10 YEARS

82
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:08,532
ON EACH COUNT.

83
00:02:08,532 --> 00:02:09,967
THEY PERSONAL THEM SO THE

84
00:02:09,967 --> 00:02:11,536
MAX HE COULD FACE WAS 10.

85
00:02:11,536 --> 00:02:13,038
THE JUDGE STEAD 3 TO 10

86
00:02:13,038 --> 00:02:14,205
TOUCHING ON THAT MAXIMUM

87
00:02:14,205 --> 00:02:15,173
SENTENCE THAT HE COULD HAVE

88
00:02:15,173 --> 00:02:16,207
RECEIVED BASED ON THE

89
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:17,042
MERGING OF THE CHARGES.

90
00:02:17,042 --> 00:02:18,643
ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS WAS

91
00:02:18,643 --> 00:02:20,011
WOULD THE JUDGE ALLOW HIM

92
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:21,379
FREE ON BAIL WHILE HE

93
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:22,414
CONSIDERED ANY APPEAL THAT

94
00:02:22,414 --> 00:02:24,182
MIGHT BE FILED AND THE D.A.

95
00:02:24,182 --> 00:02:25,216
KEVIN STEELE SAID BECAUSE

96
00:02:25,216 --> 00:02:27,652
YOU DEEMED HIM A SEXUALLY

97
00:02:27,652 --> 00:02:29,554
VIOLENT PREDATOR HE DOESN'T

98
00:02:29,554 --> 00:02:30,822
QUALIFY FOR HOUSE ARREST

99
00:02:30,822 --> 00:02:31,656
THAT MAY HAVE PLAYED INTO

100
00:02:31,656 --> 00:02:32,791
THE JUDGE'S DECISION.

101
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,861
WE'RE JUST NOT SURE ABOUT

102
00:02:35,861 --> 00:02:36,161
THAT.

103
00:02:36,161 --> 00:02:36,595
TELL YOU THIS.

104
00:02:36,595 --> 00:02:37,829
BILL COSBY COULD HAVE SPOKEN

105
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:39,197
IN COURT TODAY IN HIS OWN

106
00:02:39,197 --> 00:02:39,531
DEFENSE.

107
00:02:39,531 --> 00:02:40,365
HE COULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING

108
00:02:40,365 --> 00:02:41,900
TO THE CHARGE ABOUT REMORSE

109
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,068
FOR WHAT HE HAD DONE.

110
00:02:43,068 --> 00:02:44,002
HE DIDN'T DO THAT.

111
00:02:44,002 --> 00:02:45,437
AND THERE WAS TALK BEFORE

112
00:02:45,437 --> 00:02:47,306
HAND THAT HE PROBABLY

113
00:02:47,306 --> 00:02:48,874
WOULDN'T BECAUSE IF HE SAYS

114
00:02:48,874 --> 00:02:50,575
HE HAS REMORSE, THAT

115
00:02:50,575 --> 00:02:52,210
WOULDN'T SUPPORT AN APPEAL

116
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,845
IF HE CLAIMS INNOCENCE.

117
00:02:53,845 --> 00:02:55,414
WE CAN TELL YOU THAT WHEN

118
00:02:55,414 --> 00:02:57,349
BILL COSBY IN COURT WAS

119
00:02:57,349 --> 00:02:58,183
INFORMED OF THE

120
00:02:58,183 --> 00:03:00,986
RESPONSIBILITIES HE WOULD

121
00:03:00,986 --> 00:03:02,254
HAVE AS A SEX OFFENDER, HE

122
00:03:02,254 --> 00:03:04,022
WAS TOLD THAT THE VICTIMS IN

123
00:03:04,022 --> 00:03:07,025
THIS CASE WOULD BE NOTIFIED.

124
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:09,695
BILL COSBY ASKED IF HE HAD

125
00:03:09,695 --> 00:03:11,530
TO NOTIFY THEM AND WAS TOLD

126
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:11,797
NO.

127
00:03:11,797 --> 00:03:13,899
AND COSBY, ACCORDING TO OUR

128
00:03:13,899 --> 00:03:14,833
PRODUCER IN THE COURTROOM

129
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:15,967
REPLIED GOOD.

130
00:03:15,967 --> 00:03:17,302
SO, THAT'S BEING HANDLED BY

131
00:03:17,302 --> 00:03:18,070
THE STATE.

132
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,038
BILL COSBY IS NOT NOTIFYING

133
00:03:20,038 --> 00:03:20,706
HIS OFFENDERS.

134
00:03:20,706 --> 00:03:22,708
HE HAS BEEN TOLD YOU CAN'T

135
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,042
CONTACT -- EXCUSE ME, HIS

136
00:03:24,042 --> 00:03:24,409
VICTIMS.

137
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:26,078
AND THERE IS ONE CONFIRMED

138
00:03:26,078 --> 00:03:27,813
VICTIM HERE BUT MORE THAN 06

139
00:03:27,813 --> 00:03:29,481
WOMEN CLAIM THAT BILL COSBY

140
00:03:29,481 --> 00:03:30,182
ASSAULTED THEM.

141
00:03:30,182 --> 00:03:31,316
AND SEVERAL OF THEM WERE IN

142
00:03:31,316 --> 00:03:32,451
THE COURTROOM.

143
00:03:32,451 --> 00:03:36,121
INCLUDING FORMER SUPERMODEL

144
00:03:36,121 --> 00:03:37,990
JANET DICKERSON SHE WAS HERE

145
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,458

146
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:43,495
INSIDE THE COURTROOM IN

147
00:03:43,495 --> 00:03:45,197
NORRIS TOWN COURTHOUSE.

148
00:03:45,197 --> 00:03:46,999
WE EXPECTED TO HEAR FROM A

149
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:48,267
D.A. AT A NEWS CONFERENCE.

150
00:03:48,267 --> 00:03:49,201
PROBABLY SOME OF THESE WOMEN

151
00:03:49,201 --> 00:03:50,369
WHO HAVE BEEN SPENDING MUCH

152
00:03:50,369 --> 00:03:51,336
