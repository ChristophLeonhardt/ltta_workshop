did you know that TYT now is a full audio network on top of our existing lineup this launch is gonna bring you brand-new slate of podcasts including mouthy messy mandatory with Katy Anthony and Ronit fan glass plank now that's a weekly show that discusses everything from family to really funny and fantastic women to get more info on the show and the whole TYT audio network visit t y-t-dot-com slash audio a look at the current electoral map shows that Donald Trump could be losing a considerable amount of support in the swing states that really helped him win the election now of course this doesn't really mean anything because the general election is still years away but nonetheless in you know we talked about his base and how they hold firm and they still continue to support Trump even though he passes policies that hurt them but there are people in the country who are like yeah we have now soured on mr. Trump so the Trump shift was to do better than Mitt Romney with white voters with no college degree non college whites are over-represented in a few key swing states so Trump's narrow wins in Pennsylvania Wisconsin and Michigan netted him a bonanza of electoral votes all right well morning consult just did a a map the latest electoral map and it looks a lot more like the 2012 map than the 2016 map okay so Trump is actually underwater not just in the three critical swing states Pennsylvania Michigan and Wisconsin but also in Iowa and Ohio so a couple of really interesting things there Hillary Clinton lost Iowa with a worse deficit that she lost Texas so she was closer in Texas than she was in Iowa which is stunning given that Obama won Iowa so she did terrible in Iowa right now it's reversed again and I was headed towards the Democrats if their election were held today another amazing fact Trump holds a lead in Utah you're not surprised by that you tell us one of the reddest states in the country by one point just one point that's amazing people in Utah really don't like Donald Trump they've never liked this policy on immigrants because Mormons view themselves as immigrants and Mormons for all the different issues throughout history that they have had in terms of discriminating against others I have also been actually cared about Family Values right and and been very decent to one another so it's a mixed bag and when they're wrong we call them out on it etc but but they have not been as hypocritical as others on Family Values so they are not they don't like Trump's record on that count and they never have and they vote for a third party candidate in in the election not enough to swing the state but got a huge percentage of the vote McMullen did in Utah so they've never been fond of Trump but now the disconcerting news Trump is still up by five in Florida I know I know so he has a bigger lead in Florida than he does in Utah so for all those pundits who think oh I well as Tip O'Neill said dude Tip O'Neill was in 1970s this electoral map is moving like almost every month right and it's now topsy-turvy where you can't tell where Ohio and Florida and Iowa and Texas and Utah are going and these guys still use the leftover ideology of 1970s and 1990s almost every pundit on television still says moronic things from decades ago when in reality our entire culture is moving why because in the old days the in the newspaper endorsement in Iowa mattered a lot and so when you were going to the Iowa caucus you really needed those endorsements now no one reads the paper in Iowa you know what they do they come on the internet so we're yes you still have the red states that are very state in the very red and the blue states that are very liberal but we're getting more and more mixed up because we're all starting to get the information from the same place so it's got his upsides and its downsides right and so you know that the social media has its issues but on the other hand we're on the Internet hey you okay so this map is gonna keep on moving buckle up and and I think that it's gonna be a great thing overall Trump might not even be in the 2020 election we'll see how it goes that would be fantastic well but one other thing I wanted to mention in regard to Florida yes he's up by five points but remember the election is years away it is good to gauge how Trump is doing though I wonder what Florida's situation will be as more Puerto Ricans immigrate to Florida and by the way I know Puerto Rico is part of the United States but I mean you know travel or move to Florida it's a better way of putting it I wonder how that will play out because Puerto Rico is still in terrible shape I mean Trump has completely neglected Puerto Rico there are still huge portions where there's still no electricity the infrastructure is still falling apart because of the hurricane and the devastation there people are desperate they're gonna move to Florida and I'm curious to see how that's gonna play a role in in the way Floridians vote all right so last thing on this is that what people also honor estimate is how terrible candidate Hillary Clinton was so on the day of the election there was a poll out that she had Trump at 37 percent approval and he won the electoral college anyway now he lost the popular vote by 3 million but he still won the electoral college which is on in this in the same system that we have what what matters but you forget how deeply unpopular he was because again in television it's who's the winner who's the loser he's the winner he must be great everybody must like him no they didn't like him they just disliked his opponent even more it was the two most unpopular candidates in American history that's not my opinion that's the polling that indicated that so next time if he is in the election which he might not not only because of the charges that might come out against them but also because he's probably gonna get primary now he's unlikely to lose a Republican primary but anything could happen right but next time he won't be up against Clinton and so these terrible terrible numbers that he's always had right now they say he's booming you know what his popularity is up to last poll that I saw 39% booming 39% is a miserable number all you do is put a person on there that doesn't represent everything that Americans hate about the elite and the establishment and you will destroy him so I'm gonna stick with my prediction that I have had from day one you get a progressive an actual progress of someone like Bernie Sanders if not Bernie Sanders and they will win 42 states I know everybody on TV right now snickering said this in the 1970s and all politics is local rascal online thinks that this Bernie Sanders with his uncombed hair could win 42 states do you know that he's a Democratic Socialist all right man come and get some this map is terrible for Trump it's terrible for the Republicans and if we have someone who isn't deeply despised as the Democratic candidate they will actually rout the Republicans two easy ways following Turks want us hit
