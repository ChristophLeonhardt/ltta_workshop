MARIAH CAREY HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT BY HER FORMER SECURITY GUARD. MIGHT GO AND ELLA WHO IS THE CEO OF LOS ANGELES-BASED AND NOAH CONSULTING IS ACTUALLY THREATENING TO SUE HER FOR UNPAID BILLS AND EXCESS OF $220,000 FOR WORK UNDERTAKEN BETWEEN JUNE 2015 AND MAY 2017. FURTHER: OBVIOUSLY THERE IS ARE ALL ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AND OBVIOUSLY THINK IN THE MIDST OF ALL OF THE HARVEY WEINSTEIN FOLLOW IN ALL OF THESE OTHER FAMOUS PEOPLE IN HOLLYWOOD BEING BROUGHT DOWN BY SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL ABUSE CLAIMS AND ALLEGATIONS, THIS IS ADDING TO THE LIST WITH A LITTLE BIT OF A TWIST, REQUEST ON A LOT OF THESE CASES WE'VE SEEN WOMEN ACCUSING MEN OF THESE ACTIONS AND NOW THIS SORT OF FLIPS THE TABLE. WHAT YOU GUYS THINK ABOUT THIS? GO-AHEAD. I FEEL LIKE I JUMP IN IMMEDIATELY. GO-AHEAD. YEAH, IF YOU ARE SEXUALLY HARASSING PEOPLE, I THINK THE ACCUSATIONS SHOULD COME FORWARD AND WE SHOULD INVESTIGATE AND FIND OUT WHO IT IS REGARDLESS OF THE GENDER OF THE PERSON WHO IS ACTUALLY PERPETUATING THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT. I THINK SOME OF THE CLAIMS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC NUMBER I CARRIES ALWAYS IN A N…GLIG…E. HAVE YOU SEEN HER MUSIC VIDEOS? I'VE NEVER NOT SEEN HER ALMOST NAKED, SO IT IS PROBABLY ALSO THE LAZIEST SEXUAL HARASSMENT, BASED ON HER PERFORMANCES, AND HAS TO BE REALLY BAD, BUT AGAIN, HARASSMENT OF ANY FORM HAS TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY, FOLKS NEED TO COME FORWARD AND HE NEEDS TO FILE THIS SO CAN BE FURTHER INVESTIGATED. YES. I AGREE WITH YOU GUYS. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL ABUSE HAPPENS TO MEN TOO AND I THINK THAT IS AN IMPORTANT SORT OF NUANCE TO A LOT OF THE ALLEGATIONS THAT WE ARE SEEING IN THE MEDIA RIGHT NOW. THAT SAID, THERE'S A LOT GOING ON HERE. HE IS UNPAID. HE IS SAYING THAT SHE IS RACIST. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE IS SAYING SHE SAID WAS THAT SHE WAS RACIST BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO BE SURROUNDED BY BLACK GUYS AND NOT WHITE PEOPLE. 1ST OF ALL, REVERSE RACISM IS NOT A THING SO THAT IS THE FIRST THING. NOT A THING. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS. WHAT IS REFERS RACISM NOT A THING ME? WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT AND IS HIM, LIKE SEXISM, RACISM, WHATEVER IT IS. YOU CAN DO A BETTER JOB OF THIS BECAUSE YOU ARE A SOCIOLOGIST BUT YOU ARE ALSO LOOK AT THE OPPRESSOR AND OPPRESSED AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT DYNAMIC IN THE SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS, THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS, THEY ARE GOING TO BE INDIVIDUAL BIASES AND STEREOTYPES AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT IS A SYSTEMIC LEVEL THE OPPRESSED CAN'T BE RACIST OR SEXIST AGAINST THE OPPRESSOR. BUT WHAT IF SHE'S LIKE I HATE WHITE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY ARE INHERENTLY INFERIOR TO ME. SO I DO NOT WANT THEM AROUND ME? THERE CAN BE AN INDIVIDUAL THAT CAN FEEL THAT WAY, BUT IT IS NOT THE WHOLE RACISM BECAUSE IT IS NOT A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM. I GET WHAT YOU WERE SAYING. I THINK THOSE WORDS, I GET IT. YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE HISTORICAL LEGACY OF OPPRESSION AND THE THINGS THAT BEEN HAPPENING SINCE SLAVERY BUT IT IS LIKE, IF SHE IS BEING RACIST WHITE PEOPLE, SHE CAN BE RACIST FOR WHITE PEOPLE, RIGHT? I AS A JEW CAN BE RACIST TOWARD PEOPLE WHO HAVE OPPRESSED ME IN THE PAST. I THINK IT IS JUST THE WAY WE'RE USING THESE TERMS AND I THINK WE GET CAUGHT UP IN HOW WE, SEMANTICS AROUND THESE THINGS. SHE IS DISPLAYING BIGOTED BEHAVIOR AND SAYING THINGS THAT ARE RACIST. SHE MAY BE DISCRIMINATING IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE BECAUSE IT IS THE WORKPLACE WHICH I THINK IS PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE YOU SHOULD EXERT SOME SORT OF CONTROL OVER WHO IS HIRED IF YOU DO OF THE ISSUE, THEN WHY IS IT ON DISPLAY IN THESE INTERPERSONAL INTERACTIONS WHEN HE IS AN ASSISTANT, A BODYGUARD. YOU EXERT SOME CONTROL OVER WHO IS BEING HIRED AND NOT TO SAY THAT SHE IS NOT OPENLY DISCRIMINATING BY NOT ACTIVELY HIRING WHITE PEOPLE. I DON'T KNOW, I FEEL LIKE HER ETHNICITY IS KIND OF AMBIGUOUS OF THIS IS KIND OF AN INTERESTING CASE. IN ANY LIGHT THINK ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION OR HARASSMENT NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED AND TAKEN SERIOUSLY. IT'S A LITTLE NEBULOUS HERE AS TO WHAT IS HAPPENED AND I THINK THAT IS WHY IT IS JUST A LITTLE TRICKY TO SUSS OUT. IN ANY CRIME IT SEEMS THERE IS AN ACT IN AN INTENSE THAT YOU CAN BE IN MARIAH CAREY AND SHE IS IN REVEALING OUTFITS AND IT IS THE STAGE AT THE GRAMMYS AND THERE IS ONE WHEN SHE IS IN A REVEALING OUTFIT AND SHE IS INTENTIONALLY MAKING YOU FEEL AWKWARD AND POWERLESS WHEN SHE IS MAKING YOU COME IN AND TAKE HER LUGGAGE AWAY, WHEN YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE SAID THAT THIS MAKES YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE IN THIS NOT PART OF YOUR JOB AND IT SHOULDN'T BE PART OF YOUR JOB. I AGREE WITH YOU. THERE ARE OTHER ALLEGATIONS THAT I'VE READ FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES, ONE OF WHICH SAYING THAT SHE WAS PARTAKING IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY WITH SOMEBODY AND HE FELT LIKE SHE WAS MAKING SURE THEY HE WITNESSED IT. THAT IS CREEPY. YOU ARE ALSO A SECURITY GUARD AND IF YOU WERE STANDING OUTSIDE OF HER ROOM TO PROTECT SOMEBODY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LINES ARE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE THIS IS ALL SORT OF COMING OUT RIGHT NOW AND I THINK THERE IS A LOT WE STILL NEED TO LOOK INTO. THAT SAID, I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STORY BECAUSE SEXUAL-HARASSMENT OBVIOUSLY CAN HAPPEN TO MEN TO AS WE'VE SEEN IN THAT KEVIN SPACEY ALLEGATIONS AND NOW POTENTIALLY IN THEM OR I CARRY ALLEGATIONS TO. AND THINK IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE IT IS ANOTHER CASE, ALTHOUGH NOT AS CLEAR, HOW DO YOU MAINTAIN PROFESSIONALISM IN THESE PROFESSIONAL SPACES. THINK WITH FIGURE OUT HOW TO CARVEOUT BOUNDARIES THAT ARE CLEAR BECAUSE THIS ISN'T A FORMAL OFFICE SPACE. YOU ARE A SECURITY GUARD SO THEY DO KIND OF TRAVERSE THE BOUNDARIES OF INTERPERSONAL INTERACTIONS. THEY ARE THERE WHEN YOU ARE CHANGING OR POSSIBLY SLEEPING WITH SOMEONE SO HOW DO YOU DEFINE WHAT HARASSMENT IS. IT SOUNDS LIKE, I GUESS IT PROBABLY HAPPENS IN GAME OF THRONES BUT I REMEMBER THERE'S A SHOW CALLED ROMER SHE IS HAVING SEX AND ALL OF HER GUYS ARE STANDING AROUND IN A CIRCLE. IT SEEMS LIKE THESE ARCHAIC TERRIFYING MEDIEVAL SITUATIONS. I WILL SAY THAT I AM GLAD THAT HOLLYWOOD IS CHANGING. I WAS AN ASSISTANT AT A TALENT AGENCY AND I WAS RIGHT FOR GREAT PEOPLE BUT YOU WOULD BE ON THE PHONE, LISTENING AND EVERYBODY'S CONVERSATIONS UNLESS YOU NEED IN CASE YOU NEED TO SEND A PACKAGE OR SOMETHING AND YOU HEAR IT, JUST TERRIFYING THINGS ON THE PHONE AND YOU HEAR STORIES FROM OTHER ASSISTANTS WORKING OTHER PLACES AND I TALKED TO VARIOUS PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY AND THEY HAVE SAID TIMES HAVE CHANGED. THEY KNOW THAT THIS IS HAPPENING AND HR DEPARTMENTS EXIST NOW WHEREAS BEFORE IT WAS JUST THE PERSON WHO SIGNED YOUR CHECK AND THERE WASN'T A REAL, FULLY DEVELOPED HR DEPARTMENT YOU COULD GO TO AND I HEARD OF ONE STORY WHERE, IN MY DAY, YOU HEAR THESE THINGS ABOUT, WHAT ARE YOU WEARING KIND OF TEXT GOING TO ASSISTANTS AND SAYING REALLY UNTOWARD HORRIBLE THINGS AND THEN I HEARD ONE STORY ABOUT SOMEONE WHO JUST SENT ONE TEXT THAT WAS MORE ABOUT WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT NOW WHICH COULD BE A BUNCH OF THINGS BUT AS AN ASSISTANCE AFTER HOURS YOU WOULD GET CALLED TO MAKE A DELIVERY 8:30 PM ON A FRIDAY NIGHT, YOU JUST HAD TO DO IT BECAUSE IT WAS PART OF YOUR JOB AT THE AMBIGUITY THERE, THEY WERE BOTH BROUGHT IN AND ASKED TO HASH IT OUT AND ESTABLISH THOSE BOUNDARIES WHICH IS A VERY RESPONSIBLE STEP WHICH I DON'T REMEMBER EXACTLY HAPPENING 15 YEARS AGO. I THINK THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO KIND OF PIGGYBACK OFF OF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING AND TO ADDRESS WHAT YOU SAID, I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO REALLY DEFINE WHAT SEXUAL-HARASSMENT IS, WHAT SEXUAL ABUSES AND SEXUAL ASSAULT IN ALL THOSE THINGS BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO. WE SHOULD KNOW WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE, I THINK RIGHT NOW IT DOES SEEM A LITTLE BIT NEBULOUS AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT IN DIFFERENT SCENARIOS WHEN IT IS THE INTERPERSONAL AND YOU HAVE BUSINESS SORT OF MIXING WHERE YOU'D ARE DOING LATE-NIGHT DELIVERIES AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO INTERPRET TEXT OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE. THERE IS A LOT OF CONFUSION. EVEN THOUGH MAYBE THERE SHOULDN'T BE, I STILL THINK THAT IT EXISTS SO LET'S DEFINE IT, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? BREAK IT DOWN, EVERY LITTLE THING RIGHT HERE IS CONSIDERED SEXUAL-HARASSMENT, THIS IS SEXUAL ASSAULT, THIS IS SEXUAL ABUSE. I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO BE VERY SPECIFIC SO PEOPLE, EXCEPT FOR SOME OF THE BIGGEST OFFENDERS, I THINK IF THEY ARE SEEMINGLY INNOCUOUS, I THING NOBODY REALLY WANTS TO BE CREEPY OR HARASSING. I DON'T KNOW. I THINK THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE BUT FOR YOUR EVERY DAY SORT OF WINK AT THE WOMAN AND THINGS LIKE THAT, I THINK IF YOU ARE MADE CLEAR, HEY, THAT IS SEXUAL-HARASSMENT THE NAVY FEWER PEOPLE WOULD DO IT. I THINK, I HOPE. I THE SAME REACTION. I HEAR THAT AND I WANT TO BELIEVE IT SO BADLY, BUT I THINK THAT ENTERTAINMENT IS A SPECIFIC KIND OF INDUSTRY THAT YOU GET INTO FOR THE POWER AND THE COOLNESS OF IT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DRAWN TO FOR THOSE REASONS. THERE ARE THE PURE ARTISTS AND THE PRODUCERS THAT ARE REALLY IN IT TO MAKE AMAZING ARTS BUT THERE ARE ALSO PEOPLE THERE JUST TO GO TO PARTIES AND GET DRUNK AND GET CHICKS. THAT INSTINCT IS STILL OUT THERE. I THINK IT EXISTS, THAT STARTS IN FRATERNITIES. IT IS VERY FRIDAY. THIS IS A PERVASIVE ISSUE. THERE ARE MANY WORKPLACES THAT ARE UNDER FIRE NOW BECAUSE THE COCKTAIL PARTY GOT TOO OUT OF CONTROL AND YOUR BOSS CAME UP AND SAID SOMETHING INAPPROPRIATE, RIGHT? THAT IS JUST PAR FOR THE COURSE. TO YOUR POINT, DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS OF WHAT THEY THINK SEXUAL-HARASSMENT OR ASSAULT IS. THEY EVEN BASE IT ON THE TYPE OF THE RELATIONSHIP THEY THINK THEY HAVE WITH THEIR COWORKER. OH, WE ARE COOL SO I AM GOING TO SAY SOMETHING WILDLY INAPPROPRIATE BECAUSE THAT IS HANNAH. IT'S LIKE ACTUALLY WE STILL WORK TOGETHER, THERE SHOULD BE SOME BOUNDARIES. IT IS A DICEY ISSUE. I THINK PARTICULARLY THINGS MAY CHANGE A LITTLE BIT MORE IN MEDIA BECAUSE OF THE STIGMA AROUND KIND OF BEING OUTED. I THINK THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN SO MUCH WHERE THE REGULAR WORKPLACES. NO ONE IS WONDERING WHAT FEDEX IS DOING BUT SOME OF THESE CORPORATIONS OR PUBLIC FIGURES WERE LIKE OH, YOU ARE HARASSING PEOPLE? I'M NOT GOING TO WATCH HOUSE OF CARDS. HAVING A PLATFORM IS A HUGE DEAL. SIMILAR TO THAT I TALKED TO A PRODUCER WHO HAS BEEN IN THE TOWN FOR PROBABLY 30 YEARS AND HE SAID THAT HE THINKS IT IS BECAUSE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE LIKE, WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO SETTLEMENTS ANYMORE. IT IS ALL ABOUT PROFIT. PEOPLE ARE GETTING BETTER AT IT. THE PEOPLE WHO YOU BEEN ABLE TO SCARE INTO SUBMISSION FOR SO LONG ARE NOT AS FRIGHTENED ANYMORE. THEY ARE GOING TO TELL ON YOU AND THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A GOOD CASE BECAUSE EVERYTHING, WHEREAS BEFORE WAS A PHONE CALL THAT THEY MADE, NOW IT'S A TEXT MESSAGE AND AN EMAIL THAT THEY CAN PRINT OUT AND SHOW IN COURT AND HE IS JUST LIKE YEAH, FOR WHATEVER REASON, ACTUALLY GETS IT TO HAPPEN EVEN IF IT IS THE INSURANCE COMPANY THIS IS A GOOD THING THAT IS HAPPENING. BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY HAS INTEGRITY.
