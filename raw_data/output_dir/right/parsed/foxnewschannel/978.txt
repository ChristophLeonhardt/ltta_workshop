>> JUST STAY TUNED.
>> Martha: STAY TUNED, OKAY.
WE WILL.
SENATOR GRAHAM, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH, ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU.
HERE NO JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS
STRATEGIC ANALYST, SENIOR
STRATEGIC ANALYST AND CARE,
CHAIRMAN OF THE INSTITUTE OF
WAR, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT WE
WITNESSED LAST NIGHT BETWEEN
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG UN?
>> I THINK EVERYBODY AROUND THE
PRESIDENT I THINK HAS GOT THE
IMPRESSION THAT KIM JONG UN HAS
MADE A STRATEGIC POLICY CHANGE,
THAT HE WANTS TO MOVE AWAY AS
YOU DEFINED IT FROM THE
STATUS QUO AS WE KNOW IT TO
SOMETHING FUNDAMENTALLY
DIFFERENT TO OPEN UP MAY BE
PEACE AND PROSPERITY FOR HIS
COUNTRY.
WE ARE IN THE BEGINNING OF THAT
PROCESS TO BE SURE AND WE'VE GOT
TO GET TO THE FACTS AND THE
DETAILS OF IT.
TO ME, THE ESSENCE OF IT WILL
COME DOWN TO THIS, WHEN OUR
PEOPLE PUT IN FRONT OF THEM, WE
NEED TO KNOW WHERE ALL OF YOUR
NUCLEAR FACILITIES ARE LOCATED
TO APPROVE YOUR FUEL SITES, YOUR
RESEARCH AND TEST CENTERS UNDER
BALLISTIC MISSILES, WE BELIEVE
UNCLASSIFIED TEN TO 20 NUCLEAR
WEAPONS, 70 TO 80 BALLISTIC
MISSILES.
WE KNOW WHERE MOST OF THAT IS,
BUT NOT WHERE ALL OF THAT IS.
WHEN THEY PUT THOSE
IDENTIFICATION AND LOCATIONS ON
THE TABLE, THEY ARE LYING TO US
WE WILL KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE
KNOW WHERE MOST OF IT IS AND
THAT WILL BE VERY REVEALING TO
US.
IF THEY ARE REALLY GOING TO
DISCLOSE WHERE EVERYTHING IS
THAT WE ARE INTERESTED IN IN
DENUCLEARIZING, THAT IS
FUNDAMENTALLY STEP 12 MOVING
TOWARDS VERIFICATION OF ALL OF
THOSE SYSTEMS THAT THEY
IDENTIFIED.
SO THAT STAFF HAS YET TO BE
TAKEN AND WHEN IT DOES IT WILL
BE VERY REVEALING.
>> Martha: WHAT DID YOU MAKE
OF THE PRESIDENT SAYING WE DON'T
REALLY NEED TO DO THESE
EXERCISES, THE BIANNUAL
EXERCISES WITH SOUTH KOREA, IS
PROVOCATIVE.
THAT WAS THE WHERE THE PRESIDENT
USED AND UNNECESSARY, IS HE
RIGHT?
>> I THINK THEY SLIGHTLY CAME
OUT OF NEGOTIATIONS.
MY TAKE ON IT, I DON'T THINK IT
WAS ON THE TABLE GOING IN.
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING MAYBE
KIM JONG UN MENTIONED ABOUT IT
BEING PROVOCATIVE THAT WE FLY
NUCLEAR BOMBERS UP TO ALMOST THE
BORDER OF NORTH KOREA AND HE
SENSES THAT THAT IS AN ACT OF
AGGRESSION IN A SENSE, DESPITE
THE FACT OF ALL OF HIS ACTS OF
AGGRESSION THAT HIS REGIME HAS
DONE FOR YEARS.
HERE'S WHAT I THINK.
IF YOU LISTEN TO WHAT THE
PRESIDENT SAID, IT'S
CONDITIONS-BASED.
THE EXERCISE OF COMING A SPRING
OF 2019.
WE ARE GOING TO KNOW BY THE END
OF THIS YEAR THAT THESE GUYS ARE
REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT
DENUCLEARIZATION AND STARTING UP
THAT EXERCISE AGAIN AND STARTING
UP SANCTIONS AGAIN AND BEGINNING
CYBER OFFENSE OF OPERATIONS FOR
THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME, ALL OF
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE ON THE
TABLE IF THEY ARE NOT SERIOUS.
I THINK THE MEDIA, NOT FOX, IS
OVERREACTING TO THIS IN MANY
SENSES THAT WE MADE A MAJOR
CONCESSION.
WE REALLY HAVEN'T MADE ANY
CONCESSION WHATSOEVER.
WE HAVE THROWN THEM A BONE SO TO
SPEAK.
PROVOCATIVE IS PROBABLY A POOR
CHOICE FOR THE PRESIDENCY WAS
BECAUSE IT'S LIKELY
KIM JONG UN'S TERM.
THE MONEY INVOLVED IS NOT
SIGNIFICANT.
>> Martha: AS YOU SAY, THAT'S
A GREAT POINT, GENERAL, THAT
WHEN YOU SAY THAT WE AREN'T
GOING TO NOT CONTINUE WITH THESE
EXERCISES, IT GIVES YOU LIKE
GEORGE WHEN YOU GET AROUND TO
THAT POINT NEXT SPRING WHEN
THINGS ARE GOING THE WAY YOU
LIKE.
I WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING
INTERESTING FOR YOU THAT THE
WHITE HOUSE PUT UP.
THIS WAS THE VIDEO THAT WAS PUT
TOGETHER BY THE ADMINISTRATION
TO PLAY FOR KIM JONG UN ON, AND
IT'S INTERESTING TO PLAY THIS
VIDEO WITH THE FACT IN MIND THAT
KIM JONG UN'S FATHER WAS A BIG
FILM BUFF AND VERY INVOLVED IN
THE FILM INDUSTRY, SUCH AS IT IS
A NORTH KOREA ENDED MAKING THESE
KINDS OF TRAILERS THAT PERHAPS
THAT WAS THE REASON BEHIND
TRYING TO REACH IN THIS WAY.
LET'S PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF IT.
>> THERE COMES A TIME WHEN ONLY
A FEW ARE CALLED UPON TO MAKE A
DIFFERENCE, BUT THE QUESTION IS,
WHAT DIFFERENCE WILL IF YOU
MAKE?
BE PART OF THAT WORLD WHERE THE
DOORS OF OPPORTUNITY ARE READY
TO BE OPENED.
INVESTMENT FROM AROUND THE WORLD
WHERE YOU CAN HAVE MEDICAL
BREAKTHROUGHS, AND ABUNDANCE OF
RESOURCES, INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY
RESOURCES, INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOG
TECHNOLOGY, AND NEW DISCOVERIES.
WHAT IF?
CAN HISTORY BE CHANGED?
>> Martha: WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT, GENERAL?
>> I THINK THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY
BASED ON OUR INTELLIGENCE AND
OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE
KIM JONG UN'S HEAD IS, AS BEST
AS WE CAN DETERMINE.
EDUCATED IN SWITZERLAND,
TRAVELED AROUND EUROPE, AND
UNDERSTANDING OF THE WEST.
40-50 YEARS IN FRONT OF HIM IN
POWER.
HE WANTS SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR
HIMSELF, FOR HIS FAMILY, FOR
THAT COUNTRY.
THE STATUS QUO HE CURRENTLY HAS,
WHICH IS TENSION AND CRISIS, IS
SOMETHING I THINK HE WANTS TO
MOVE AWAY FROM.
AND THAT IS WHY THAT VIDEO WAS
PRODUCED.
>> Martha: AN INTERESTING
