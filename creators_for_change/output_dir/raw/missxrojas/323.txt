00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,700
and I feel disgusting and yeah I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> gay</font>

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,350
cold and everyone at my job was getting

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,110
called a lot feeling sick so I will do

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,030
raise the answers from and do it feeling

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,769
a bit like an urchin so do you forgive

7
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:16,590
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stacey FTW was one of many people who</font>

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,789
asked whether or not I was doing

9
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:20,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">nanowrimo I was considering it but I</font>

10
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:22,560
have so much on at the moment a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,000
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I haven't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even been</font>

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,740
keeping up with things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Miley kinis</font>

13
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,660
Gossip Girl recaps I just haven't been

14
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing and that I just can't at the</font>

15
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,030
moment and just generally though I I'm

16
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,590
writing quite slowly at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment but</font>

17
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,450
it's not a bad thing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I'm just</font>

18
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,640
going to stick with that who knows I

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,020
might do it later on<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the year you</font>

20
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,300
know me always<font color="#CCCCCC"> giving myself ridiculous</font>

21
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,059
challenges wherever possible and but

22
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:46,379
yeah we obvious I'm not to do it this

23
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,030
year but I good luck to anyone who's

24
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,860
doing it i hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll win Amy likes</font>

25
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,750
cheese asks how I feel about viewers

26
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,370
calling me Rosie and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of rosianna</font>

27
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,530
much the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how i feel about people</font>

28
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,480
calling me rose in santa rosa Anna I

29
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,940
don't mind a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> short</font>

30
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,980
names out of habit or<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just they</font>

31
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,530
do or they like doing I definitely feel

32
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,990
like rosianna is more my name than Rosie

33
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,430
Rosie is just the kind of shorthand

34
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,100
version of that um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really think</font>

35
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">of myself as a rosy I'm definitely</font>

36
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,650
rosianna don't know why it's just my

37
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,290
name y ma but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't mind you guys can</font>

38
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,210
cool whatever you want an oreck dogface

39
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">asks do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should avoid</font>

40
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,659
commenting when they're really tired no

41
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,610
because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> avoid video making when</font>

42
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,560
I'm really tired so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should be on the</font>

same<font color="#CCCCCC"> page guys paper ginger says you</font>

44
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,070
once mentioned that you didn't really

45
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">like many first-person narrators stories</font>

46
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was wondering</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you could explain</font>

47
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,920
what you find most annoying about them

48
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,369
in your next raise your answers um I i

49
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,049
don't know i have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say now that read</font>

50
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:45,540
slowly more broadly it's not really

51
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that i can say as a whole um I</font>

52
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,720
definitely find that in why a lot of

53
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,329
first-person<font color="#E5E5E5"> narrative stories really I</font>

54
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:57,420
don't know they just don't put enough

55
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,460
effort into actually making me think

56
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,259
that I'm in the carriages head or that

57
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:03,810
I'm on some level of empathizing with a

58
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">character I think it's something that's</font>

59
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,079
more to do with my feelings towards

60
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,419
young adult literature than<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wasn't it</font>

61
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,260
so ya authors can use it as an easy way

62
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,890
to tell instead of to show there's that

63
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,480
big thing in writing is supposed to show

64
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,580
not tell and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first person</font>

65
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,200
narration can sometimes become all about

66
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">their telling and to a point that's just</font>

67
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:28,110
bad bad writing Eric color Rosie Rosie I

68
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,940
don't know how to pronounce<font color="#E5E5E5"> that asks do</font>

69
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,290
you plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> on collaborating with other</font>

70
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,959
youtubers in the future I mean every

71
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,180
every day is a sort of collaboration who

72
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,769
knows who's cough will appear in the

73
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:39,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">video next now I would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

74
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,730
projects with other youtubers especially

75
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">because I love them have very specific</font>

76
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,830
skill sets in video making in general

77
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,660
and in editing and all that sort of

78
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,569
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I just don't have and</font>

79
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:52,319
collaborating with them as a really nice

80
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,780
way to share their skill sets and that

81
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,250
you know one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us might have and the</font>

82
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,780
other one doesn't but also just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

83
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,250
I have not so very talented friends who

84
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,870
are great youtubers and I think it's

85
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,850
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun to watch a collaboration for</font>

86
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,160
me at the moment it's a lot that time

87
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,310
and about energy and two things of which

88
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,440
I am quite short of at the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

89
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,140
but whenever I deal with collaboration I

90
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,970
would want to come up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very</font>

91
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,459
specific idea and pitch that to them so

92
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,260
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> knows what will happen but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure</font>

93
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,940
there'll be some collaboration at least

94
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,620
within the house and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a flat rather</font>

95
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,049
funny invisible string asks what is your

96
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:26,640
opinion on the banning of certain books

97
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">and schools libraries etc I think it's</font>

98
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:34,530
bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it is a bad thing to do I</font>

99
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,720
think you cannot tell people not to read

100
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,180
something because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the certain way</font>

101
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you feel about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and there are</font>

102
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,680
books like this book<font color="#E5E5E5"> called the AL kiss</font>

103
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,230
cookbook it teaches<font color="#E5E5E5"> you how to like make</font>

00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,079
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> balm at home and things like that foot</font>

like<font color="#E5E5E5"> safety reasons yeah but say at the</font>

106
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,090
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day we now have the internet</font>

107
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,829
and I think people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who want to find that</font>

108
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:57,120
information can find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've</font>

109
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,609
information so you're bamming that I'd

110
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:01,319
much rather people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have access to all</font>

111
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">sorts of books so they can balance their</font>

112
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,910
reading out themselves by having the

113
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,010
wide selection rather than being<font color="#CCCCCC"> told</font>

114
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,690
what to read and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to read in</font>

115
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,910
such a forceful in restrictive way also

116
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,500
in a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> makes people immediately</font>

117
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,480
biased against certain books without

118
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,430
having read them just because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font>

119
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,589
they've heard about<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and that's more</font>

120
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:21,089
what battling with books is about it's

121
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:21,779
about the tour

122
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,190
around a book rather than the book

123
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,310
itself I wish people<font color="#E5E5E5"> would just read the</font>

124
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,590
books that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are so fearful and the</font>

139
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,510
to just be reading the things i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

140
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,540
read but have all this really valuable

141
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,020
education behind me and i'm sure i'll

142
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,850
