on Tuesdays singer Alicia Keys who performed the 2016 Democratic National Convention of course posted this tweet it says that's not the right one that's the right there we go it says our strength is in our differences our power is in our diversity we are so beautiful all of us when we see each other we see ourselves and then it's a picture of her or another woman in the niqab okay the niqab is the is the giant covering that covers your entire face except for your eyes and then she's wearing what appears to be a black form-fitting dress with her legs sticking out of it so you know the niqab is now a great thing this is just the sort of empty-headed virtue signaling you'd expect from a member of the political far left who obviously knows nothing about the way radical Islam treats women it's the idiocy of modern feminism in action it would be one thing to defend the hijab which is the Islamic head covering that virtually all religious Muslim women wear it's another to defend the niqab which is that face covering into which many religious Muslim countries force women here is the fact in the countries in which women typically wear the niqab like Saudi Arabia or Afghanistan or Iran a woman who exposed her leg the way the woman does in this photo would be criminally prosecuted in Sudan in 2015 nine women were flogged for wearing pants in Indonesia last year a Muslim woman was flogged for standing in close proximity to her boyfriend a few months ago Saudi Arabia arrested a woman for taking a photograph without her abaya that's the head covering that kind of swishes around the neck here is what that brazen hussy was wearing when the Saudis thought she was immodest yes this okay the woman receives death threats even before her arrest if her people can't actually see the picture and listening to this later she's went with a long dress and a long black coat nothing is uncovered essentially it is easy to fetishize foreign cultures but to glamorize a symbol of oppression for millions of women across the Muslim world to pretend that the great threat to freedom comes from the West which is willing to tolerate women wearing pretty much anything rather than a radical Muslim world that uses the criminal law to penalize women who violate their standards of modesty is asinine virtue signaling that forwards the oppression of women so much for feminism i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show all righty so today I actually want to talk a fair bit about this Planned Parenthood moved by the state of California the state of California is now charging the undercover filmmakers who went undercover with Planned Parenthood and showed that Planned Parenthood was selling baby body parts that they were performing abortions in ways in order to preserve the the body parts of the babies the filmmakers are the ones in trouble in California fine to kill babies finally sell their body parts not okay to go undercover to film people doing this in news reporting but even that is a Miss Reed of the law we'll go through all the law in just a second plus we will get to the latest from Trump land and and Bernie Sanders land and all the rest of the crazy lands that exist in this bizarre gameofthrones world we now inhabit but first we have to say thank you to our sponsors over at helix sleep my wife can sleep through pretty much anything loud noises or crying babies are not so subtle advances from me she's definitely out cope I am the opposite any sound movement I'm awake I can't get comfortable sleeping at least that's how it was before I found helix sleep so helix sleep sends a mattress directly to you customized to your needs you log on to helix sleep comm slash Ben you go through their questionnaire and then it asks you the body type and your weight and what kind of mattress you like and then they send it to you you take it right out of the box and inflates for you the only thing helix sleep cannot stop is my kids waking me up in the middle of the night I cannot send them back to helix leap but if I don't like the mattress I can send it back to helix sleep free of charge for a hundred nights it's a fantastic product helix sleep calm slash Bennett's helix sleep calm slash been strangely even my wife says she's sleeping better so that's pretty spectacular and thanks to our animation crew here for animating that exhausting who did that well done Austin I like the small Ben and small Ben female who are my children that is actually it people I don't put pictures of my kids on lines be online for obvious reasons for safety reasons but that's actually sort of what they funny okay so lots it lot to get to today so let's begin with this controversy over Planned Parenthood so last night it is announced by the state of California they have charged David I think is pronounced a Laden the Dalit and maybe and the Sandra Merritt of the Center for medical progress on 15 felony counts over there undercover reporting regarding Planned Parenthood so in 2015 if you recall and della didn't Maher and Merritt released video showing that high-ranking Planned Parenthood members were joking about selling baby body parts for market rates and picking through actual baby body parts in order to demonstrate which sorts of body parts were available for the sale of medical research and talking about the best methods of abortion for procuring those baby body parts I want to remind you of what's on those tapes because this is the stuff that's not criminal it's the taping that's supposedly criminal so here is one of the heads of Planned Parenthood saying that she wants to buy a lab rohini with the money that she makes from selling baby body parts hemisphere so that protects us so that we're not paying for what we can use and I mean it also I think it also Guinea from the sale of the baby body parts and that's not all they uncovered here's a little bit of the of the sort of quick and easy guides of the Planned Parenthood videos I'm Cecile Richards president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America I want to be really clear the allegation that Planned Parenthood profits in any way from tissue donation is not true generate a pheromone week nowadays come for people can't hear certain tissues like brain liver thymus pancreas heart lungs and pretty much anything on the bone the fetus it's basically a huge trafficking of fetal tissues the harder and the more valuable to tissue the more money you get so if you're if you can somehow procure a brain or a heart you're going to get more money than just like chorionic villi or umbilical cord if we alter our process and we are able to obtain intact fetal cadavers it's all just a matter of line-item seat that would be $100 per specimen 50 specimens per day would be $5,000 per day that Planned Parenthood was collecting from fetal tissue extrapolate that 120 per month to keep there are mechanisms by which the contracts can do things like that procedures are longer so then anything that we piggyback on to that for collection purposes obviously you know would have to reflect that additional time cost all right administrative burden we're working with you know almost like triple digit number clinics so it's a lot cooler stuff I mean they're talking about the killing of the unborn and then the sale of the the body parts so this obviously created a major firestorm there's talk about defunding Planned Parenthood hopefully they will still defund Planned Parenthood that doesn't have anything to the health care bill it should just be done on its own there's no need to provide federal funding for Planned Parenthood or state funding for Planned Parenthood which is as I've said before a baby genocide clinic that's what Planned Parenthood does now what does California do so important to recognize the person who initiated the crusade against david zu Laden and in Sandra Merritt the person who actually initiated that was Kamala Harris who's now the senator from California she was then the Attorney General of the state of California she's the one who ordered a raid into Layden's home to try and get her a hold of all of the all of the tapes and now they've charged 15 felony counts so here's what you need to know legally california is what we call a two-party consent state that means that if you and I are on the phone together and I tape it I can't release that tape but it's actually illegal for me to do the taping itself that is actually wiretapping and the in the formal sense of the term I can't do that without your permission however if you are a you and I are in a public place and there is no reasonable expectation of privacy that's the way the law is written if there's no reasonable expectation of privacy then me taping you is not a problem so for a Disneyland we're talking out loud about baby tissue then there is no reasonable expectation of privacy but it actually goes even further than that so 14 of the 15 charges come from the California Penal Code section 632 a that states in relevant part quote every person who intentionally and without the consent of all parties to a confidential communication by means of any electronic amplifying or recording device eavesdrops shall be punished by a fine not exceeding twenty-five hundred bucks or imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding one year or in the state prison or by both that fine and imprisonment now note the language there confidential right it's not just any confidential all parties to a confidential communication so what does that mean what is a confidential communication first off you can see from these tapes clearly that some of this is obviously not confidential they're doing in the middle of a crowded restaurant they're talking openly and loudly it's obviously not meant to be secretive Planned Parenthood Cecile Richards said that people were saying this publicly in restaurants and that this wasn't a privacy issue what they're saying is that some of the other conversations like there's a point where they went into some of the medical labs there's a point where they went into you can see a private office with some of the heads of Planned Parenthood there saying those were private conversations so that would be plausible except for this 2002 case from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2002 the Ninth Circuit was asked to rule on a case that sprang from Arizona so ABC News ABC News did a segment for primetime live in 1994 and this segment actually ended up winning a Peabody Award for great journalism and what they did is they went into a place called medical laboratory management consultants and they were talking about mammograms and whether they were effective or not whether they were over prescribed they went in undercover and here is what the courts found this is a direct quote Devaraj is the person who is the representative for medical laboratory management consultants they said Devaraj is willingness to invite these strangers into the administrative offices for a meeting and then on a tour of the premises indicated that Devaraj should not have an objectively reasonable expectation of solitude or seclusion in the parts of medical lab that he showed the ABC representative and then the court also found no reasonable expectation of privacy regarding the conversations between the ABC undercover reporters and the medical technicians this is a direct quote from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals the most liberal Court in the country Devaraj did not reveal any information about his personal life or Affairs but only generally discussed medical labs business operations the pap smear testing industry is about pap smears not mammograms and Gordon's supposed plans to open her own laboratory so the ABC pretended to be something they weren't which is exactly what this case was and then they went and talked with people in a private setting which is exactly what this case was and the court found no problem in fact the Ninth Circuit said Arizona law is not like California law maybe it would be different if this were in California but then they add this quote the expectation of private of limited privacy in a communication namely the expectation that a communication shared with or possibly overheard by a limited group of persons will nonetheless remain relatively private and secluded from the public at large is reasonable only to the extent the communication conveys information private and personal to the declarant to the deck Laurent meaning that if none of the Planned Parenthood members are talking about the stuff they do in their personal life specifically there's no problem here that's the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals this case is directly on point this is what we call good precedent from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals so here's the question where the media today the media that you know the people who we've been hearing for months and months months tyrannical Donald Trump's eradicate is going to destroy everything tyrannical awful evil Donald Trump he's going to crack down on press freedoms and he's going to ensure that no one is free he's gonna throw people in jail where are they today when the state of California is taking the undercover journalists which is what the Layden and Merritt are taking them and threatening to throw them in jail for at least 15 years apiece right that's what they're talking about because the penalty for each one of these violations is at least a year there were no more than a year so 15 years they're talking about in prison for people taping conversations that obviously our undercover journalism and in which there is no reasonable expectation of privacy according to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals whereas the Washington Post today where as CNN whereas Fox News imagine for a second imagine for a second thing back in 2012 Mitt Romney gets taped by Jimmy Carter's grandson and Jimmy Carter's grandson gets this tape at a private event where Mitt Romney is speaking okay and Mitt Romney's not speaking even to him he's just to a private group of people and this guy tapes Romney talking about the 47% imagine if Romney sued the guy or more importantly imagine if the state in which this took place decided to prosecute Jimmy Carter jr. or Jimmy Carter the third and what do you think media would do you think the media would stand up for that you think they would say oh no problem you know that was a violation of privacy expectations what do you think would happen if an undercover journalist let's say for example that there is an undercover there's somebody released without the permission of Donald Trump tape from let's say an Access Hollywood bus in California right and there was an Access Hollywood bus and there was tape that Donald Trump knew microphone was on him buddy didn't know the microphone was on obviously let's say that somebody took that tape in which Trump had a pretty reasonable expectation of privacy and then released it publicly and the state of California decided to go after and prosecute the people over at NBC or wherever this was taking play there was NBC imagine that happened do you think that the press would stand up for the person who leaked all of this and this is the point when it comes to principle the left is completely missing it it just it doesn't exist if David daleiden had been a member of Planned Parenthood and they went into an undercover investigation of people targeting Planned Parenthood if they had done an undercover investigation of live action Lila roses organization and found some sort of corruption or something damning and then they'd released that publicly do you think the media would be okay with the prosecution of the people who actually did that work of course not and this just demonstrates that when it comes to principle people are almost always willing to put their own political preferences above the importance of principle and this is just another case of that this is just another case of that and it really is quite horrifying if you are in favor of press freedom there is no way in hell you should be standing still for any of this and where the mainstream wears brian Stelter at CNN where are those where are those wonders of freedom over at the ACLU where are all the people on the left on this they're missing in action because they think it's more important to kill babies and this guy was a bad guy because he exposed the fact that killing babies was a bad thing and that Planned Parenthood was in the business of killing babies I mean there was video of them actually picking through baby body parts on a tray and they don't like that anything that makes Planned Parenthood look bad is inherently evil and must be prosecuted that sort of selective prosecution on the basis of political preference is the definition of political evil okay well I want to talk more about what's going on you know as far as the media going nuts on Trump is actually the big story of the day is the media losing their mind Hillary is back out there Hillary's back but first I want to say thank you

their minds and the way you can tell the media have lost their minds is not just because every day I keep telling you the media have lost their minds not just because the media are wildly inconsistent when it comes to things like the Planned Parenthood tapes but I'm gonna give you two examples of the media just going nuts and losing their freaking gourds a first example yesterday at the White House press briefing Sean Spicer is doing a press briefing in April Ryan who's from urban radio networks I believe American urban radio networks she starts questioning Spicer in the most obnoxious possible way I'm not a Sean Spicer fan I think that Sean Spicer is far too close to Melissa McCarthy's impression of Sean Spicer for comfort but Sean's sir is is dealing with with April Ryan's question and everybody I saw this clip tweeted out yesterday and people going crazy over and I watched it I was like I don't understand what the big problem is here here's the clip and you decide for yourself no no I get it but you keep I've said it from the day that I got here until whatever that there is no caption you've got Russia if the president puts Russian salad dressing on his salad tonight somehow that's a Russian connection but every single person no I well know that that's I appreciate your agenda here but the reality is uh no no hold on no at some point report the facts the facts are that every single person who has been briefed on this subject he's come away with the same conclusion Republican Democrat so I'm sorry that that disgusts you you're shaking your head I appreciate it but but I'm fine okay but understand that at some point the facts are what they are and every single person who has been briefed on the situation with respect to the the situation with Russia Republican Democrat Obama appointee career have all come to the same conclusion at some point April you're gonna have to take no for an answer with respect to whether or not there was collusion hold on you you it seems like you're hell-bent on trying to make sure that whatever image you want to tell about this White House stays because at the end of the day let me in okay we know what you're asking me a question and I'm gonna answer it which is the president I'm sorry please stop shaking your head again okay and that was the thing that peak I always stop shaking your head again woo he's a sexist he's a racist you never would have said anything like this okay Melissa McCarthy again is getting Reif Amos off of being Sean Spicer taking his podium and bulldozing it into the crowd right the idea that the trans fights are set this to April Ryan because April Ryan is particular because she's black or because she's a woman absolutely asinine absolutely asinine and then April Ryan is playing this thing up like she was battered or something here she is on CNN acting as though this is one of the worst moments of her life honestly if Sean Spicer telling you to stop shaking your head is the worst moment of your life you lived a pretty fantastic life here's April Ryan playing it up it's two and a half months in there's a frustration there is something we've never seen before here at this White House and Shawn has to do what he has to do he is the spokesperson for this White House but I'm a reporter and I cover all things presidential to include what is presidential those investigations on the hill it pertains to what's happening here so with everything that's going on with everything that's going on that was the question how do you revamp the image of this White House this administration has come into a new world Donald Trump is this this this mobile this real estate mobile he's a businessman but he is now president a president who's never had governance and he's finding his way and he's finding his way in ways that are hurtful to him and hopefully not hurtful to the country okay so she's playing this whole thing up and everybody on the Left is playing this up this money Sean Spicer was so mean to April Ryan now first of all I've defended April 9 before I defended ray Paul Ryan there was that situation in the in the White House press briefing room during during I think Trump himself was doing the press conference and at one point he said to April Ryan can you fix up a meeting between me in the Congressional Black Caucus it was like wait a second that's not her job that's weird but this one is just absurd on its face but this wasn't the only example of the media losing their mind over something that was almost meaningless or at least was wildly overblown would be more accurate but to hear about that you're gonna have to go to daily wired.com and become a subscriber $8 a month gets you a subscription to daily wire.com or if you want to
