Donald Trump says America first does not mean America alone address business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos but can the man has promoted protectionist policies and scrapped trade deals convinced the world the u.s. is open for business this is Inside Story hello and welcome to the program I'm Rochelle Carey america-first has long been one of the most common refrains of Donald Trump's administration u.s. president first used the phrase in his inauguration speech and he's repeated it over the past year in reference to political and economic policies so it's no surprise that the phrase resurfaced in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Friday but this time with the caveat America first does not mean America alone when the United States grows so does the world American prosperity has created countless jobs all around the globe we cannot have free and open trade if some countries exploit the system at the expense of others we support free trade but it needs to be fair and it needs to be reciprocal president Trump insists many of the trade deals the US has signed over the past decades are not reciprocal and he plans to end that trend earliness presidency Trump refused to back the trans-pacific partnership a trade deal negotiated by Barack Obama with 11 other countries in Latin America and East Asia the other TPP countries went ahead with the deal without the US Trump mentioned in his Davos speech that he may consider rejoining as president has also threatened to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA and last week Trump impose new steep tariffs on imports of solar panels and washing machines China which makes many of those products has criticized that decision let's bring in our guests now joining us in Suffolk in the UK is an Pettiford director of the uk-based think-tank prime economics which focuses on policy research and macroeconomics in Beijing michelle karachi headed the China Economic Policy Research Program with Nottingham University and in Zurich Mark Faja economics analyst and assistant professor at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies and welcome to all of you mark I want to start with you because I understand that you have just returned from Davos so how would you say yes president Donald Trump's speech was received there well I think it was received more positively than expected anticipated initially of course there's a lot of antipathy towards Donald Trump among some of the quote unquote economic elites of this world and liberal elites but on the other hand the economy in the US and the tax cuts have been a boost to the economy and so the economic you know sort of balance sheet right now looks pretty good for a report card looks pretty good for Donald Trump and he has thus won some favor in fact despite some you know reservations towards him as a personality is it a bit soon though to know for sure what the impact of the the tax cuts is going to be well I think as Donald Trump himself said in fact the impact has already been seen because people have already figured in in the valuations of companies etc that these tax cuts will be a boost to earnings and we're receiving now in fact is a sort of a bubble and big fat ugly bubble as Donald Trump said about Obama administration stock market it's gotten even bigger right now and it remains to be seen whether this is sustainable growth or whether in fact there might be as some sort of a crash in the offing because it is inflated right now despite all the hype okay and so same question to you Michelle what did you hear about how Donald Trump was worried about how his speech was received adult was compared to expectations compared to expectation of beta I think there was in a way the novelty was twofold one is that he is continuing to to do and try to do what he said during the electoral campaign last year it was probably seen to do so in a way it's a rare situation around the world where we have a political leader that anyway sticks to what he said during campaign whether we like it or not that's quite unusual clearly here the message was implicitly directed at China because Trump changed a little bit to the rhetoric of his approach he said that we are open to trade with any partner America first of course but we are part of the world unless someone is not going to work according to fair and equal rules and the reciprocity and of course this is a message that is directed to China and other countries that he may perceive do things with maybe exchange rate with labor law situations salaries and so on and in a way tamping although the word dumping was not a specifically mentioned Trump wants equal trade on fair terms on reciprocal terms with the rest of the world angrily this is going to be a sore point in the us-china relationship that we can then address later on but this is you are you are right in fact we will help you in Beijing you are right we will come back to talk about China more in just a moment firstly I want to bring and into the conversation so and when Donald Trump says America first it sounds like a great campaign slogan how what does America first actually mean policy-wise has he truly articulated that well yes I think as your other contributors just said he has he does say what he means and he has done what he meant to do in other words he is promoting protectionism you know it extends from building a wall in Mexico to blocking or raising tariffs on washing machines and solar panels from South Korea and so on so in that sense he he's he's not moved from his agenda but what he's in my view not saying is that actually America has a massive current accountant trade deficit and so it's really rarely dependent on some of those billionaires moving their funds into the US and so you know America first here is an assumption that America can go to learn but it can't actually you know it is heavily dependent on the rest of the world for the rest of the world save in order to enable Americans to carry on consuming in the way that they do in fact when you when you say protectionism an analyst with CNBC specifically said that he this is a quote I think in 2018 one of the biggest risks we face is the Trump administration moving from rhetoric into real policy a real protectionist policy saying that he thinks it's a risk and a bad thing mark what are your thoughts on that yes it's all true but of course the US is still the preeminent economy and as we saw in Davos as well when Trump met with European executives they're still very intent on investing in the United States especially of course with these tax cuts now so it's it's not quite that clear that it will you know just be a return to mercantilism or to protectionism pure and simple and of course that's a global trend to some degree as well this is this whole trend to sort of safeguard borders etc but because by dint of the u.s. being such a powerful and important economy most states or companies will not be able to sort of easily say no to the US that having been said the dollar has suffered a lot even this week we saw that again and or even before Trump in fact people have been pulling out some of the money out of US Treasuries some of the states have so that is a whole different part of the equation as well what's the future of the dollar and the you know the dollar policy of the United States as well as Steve Newton indicated and then Trump refuted subsequently I think that's a big issue as well in the team actually that it that is a good point how important is messaging and Donald Trump is has been very unpredictable about a lot of his policies right he'll say one thing one day he'll tweet something another day someone in his cabinet says something another day how important is his messaging when it comes to trying to renegotiate any of these deals and I actually I would like mark I'll start with you and then I want the others to join in on that as well well I think if you read the art of the deal you see this is always a strategy of Trump to be ambiguous in his dealings with the other party to say one thing on one day and another thing the next day to threaten somebody and then to back and we said how is that a negotiating tactic how how can you negotiate with someone that if you don't think you're doing so in good faith well I mean that's that's his strategy right he says that the art of the deal he did that with the Chinese - he threatens him one day and then he pulls back the next day and tries to exact concessions by antagonizing the other party in the first instance and then relenting in the second I mean that's a strategy and sometimes it works sometimes it might be dangerous in political situations but you know it remains to be seen where it goes but he has a lot of trump cards so to speak in his hand still despite the u.s. losing market share you had to say trump card somebody was gonna have to say trump card today so it got to be you mark Michele so I would like your thoughts as well the fact that this has been one of the criticisms of Donald Trump's foreign policy he'll say one thing a secretary state says something else when it comes to to particularly economic policy how is important how important is it rather for the messaging to be consistent for other countries to know where the u.s. stands what they mean what it is they want well there has been some changes of rhetoric but I think the fundamental and underlying principle of trans policy really hasn't changed maybe we analysts the media have reported in different ways but when you hear him directly from his mouth as we did today in Davos his message has been clear and in a way at there to say consistent Trump is not a protectionist we do tend to say or Trump is a protection but he is not he is protecting some sub sectors of the US economy's economy and only for a limited period of time so he is in a way I would call it a Agri column a target protection is of certain sectors of certain segments of the economy now the different thing between being protectionism and not in even ideologically is that people who believe in free markets they tend to believe in free market . always at any cost people who may tend to be believing in the protectionist they never say we close our door entirely we never sell anything we never buy anything from other countries they always mean I think that's what most people think we do selected protectionism so we are here in a bit of an imbalance liberalism means open 100% protection is never means closed 100% and so if Trump puts some 30 percent tariffs on washing machines on solar panels or anything imported from China that does not making my protection his per se is just trying to protect those sectors of the economy and the thing that has not been reported is that those tariffs will taper off down to 0% in the next few years so he hasn't said 30% forever but that's what the public believes because public only reads the first sentence of what we say and what we'll report okay we're gonna do 30% now and then going down to zero at the next few years okay err did you want to get in on that but that's the problem you know Trump's messaging is chaotic let's face it as we all know when he travels abroad he tends to read his speeches written by his adviser that was the case yesterday in Davos but on the whole the messaging both on trade policy but also on foreign policy is chaotic and the danger of that and I agree that he doesn't often mean what he says and that actually it's not protection and full-blown protectionism but it but the the the chaotic nature of the messaging is that it would it raises tensions and raises trade tensions around the worlds and political tensions around the world which create financial tensions and which could trigger an accident of some kind or another so this is what is so dangerous about you know the haphazard way in which he does communicate the chaotic way in which the White House communicates with the rest of the world so I am NOT complacent about this and I don't think we should be complacent I think he is quite dangerous to the functioning of the global economy and that's because of his nationalistic and and protectionist instincts but having said that I mean he's not really addressing the real problem the real problem isn't trade the real problem of financial flows in the determination for example of the value of the dollar by markets now he has an manukan has no control over that they claim but the fact of the matter is that the dollar has been overvalued it was overvalued in 2014 and that partly explains the election of Trump because that hurt the American economy but Trump and all of the advisors are in favor of not doing anything about managing and stabilizing the global economy they're in favor of this of the global economy being managed by invisible capital markets invisible to us and unaccountable to us and responsible for more agility of currencies of trade and a financial flows they're not prepared to do anything about that they're only prepared to as I say engage in this chaotic messaging which just raises political and trade and financial tensions are do you agree with that analysis for a man yes and I would go further than that I think maybe the root problem of the global economy is financialization so we've had you know the crisis in 2008 which was solved by more liquidity quantitative easing and a competitive devaluation I don't know if the dollars to hire too low because everybody is printing like crazy and everybody is engaging in debt after debt after death you know so that I think has not been solved by Trump despite his campaign rhetoric to go against you know the Wall Street fat cats he's in fact employed people from Goldman Sachs and others he's not gone against special interests neither there nor in the foreign policy and with Israel the Israel lobby nor with the financial Lobby nor with the arms lobby so on all three fronts Trump in the fact you know betrayed his campaign promises and the financial problems go beyond Trump I think in the United States with inequality and financialization and in the whole world I think that's something that was there before and it's only been exacerbated now so it's still not been solved and we're waiting for this next bubbles in a sense to pop so we'll see when that happens you mentioned Goldman Sachs which obviously have to come up in a conversation like this I'm actually Lloyd Blankfein CEO of Goldman Goldman Sachs tweeted this after Trump's speech yesterday he said give Trump credit for campaigning or there are no electoral votes his message at Davos promoting America's interest doesn't mean withdrawing from the world agreed now can we stick with international commitments on environment trade and defense so there's actually currently third according to the World Trade Organization 35 new bilateral and regional trade pacts that are under consideration the u.s. is only in on one of them so the world is moving forward regardless of the new positioning that Donald Trump is trying to get for the u.s. can you just jump in and out of these agreements when you want to Michelle no you cannot but as a new president you can stop let's say undo everything that was done before if you don't agree with those policies and then start reasoning one by one of course other countries have the inertia from previous policies that may have no change in the last year but Trump I think approach is whatever was done before could be wrong maybe it is maybe it isn't so let's stop it let's review it and then let's reconsider if we want to carry on with those agreements or not he has said what I call it a temporary no to everything to all agreements climate trade and so on and then over time he will pick cherry-pick those they are in the interest of the u.s. or what he perceives are the interests of the US in my mind the Trump's approach is very clear we may not agree on we may not like it he feels like a CEO of a company he has a judiciary obligation to his shareholders to make them richer and in this case as president of the United States this fiduciary obligation is to the Citizen of the United States we do not say those same things about other European leaders that are tending and trending towards the protectionism as well it's just because maybe they approach with a different rhetoric or they just get the support of certain ideological fringes but he's doing what he feels here okay and we bring Ann into this agree there that's that he is looking after his base his base is gonna be hurt by these trades protectionist measures but who he is helping are the number the one percent you know that's why Gary Cohen of Goldman Sachs you know was the one that led him into Davos and that's why I'm very landed right here oat the speech it yeah so so so you know the billionaires of Davos are going to do very well the Koch brothers in the United States are going to do very well I'm not so sure that he is looking after his base and what worries me is that having promised to look after the interests of these base having pretended that protectionist a you know solar panels and washing machines is helping his base when it does not happen that way the revolt the anger will be much greater than it was in the lead-up to his election but I agree that protectionism is not privileged around the world and it's not the politicians have suddenly turned bad it's that the financial system has so harmed the interests of ordinary people that they're demanding of their politicians that they should be protected from these uncontrolled market financial ma I know and let me I wouldn't happen to know what's happened to what you're saying right there the the people that the go to Davos the people that are in that room do they have any sense of this type of anger and frustration that you're voicing that people have about about the system I think that it's not enough to know that there is deep anger out there but they're also rich enough to think they can build themselves a form of protection against it or they can bribe their way through and all they can co-opt politicians to protect them as the anger Rises but I don't think they have the slightest idea honestly of how their attitudes their neglect of of it you like the interests of ordinary people is going to damage them ultimately this is what happened in the 1930s you know people were asleep at the wheel as as nationalists and fascists came to power and they came to power because ordinary people were demanding to be protected from the uncontrolled market forces that were humming their job opportunities their abilities of their children to go to university the ability to find a roof over their heads and so on these were being destroyed by so-called market forces and by financial flows and ordinary people demanded that the politicians protect them and you know the ones that offered to protect were tended to be the right-wing nationalist leaders people like Hitler so we you know we we we are have not learned from history and certainly the billionaire class have not learned from history that you know free financial flows and uncontrolled management of the global economy can lead to a rise in nationalism and protectionism and this ultimately hurts the 1% never mind the rest of it mark I'm gonna I'm gonna give you that the last word on this right now NAFTA is still being renegotiated right now depending on how things go with NAFTA do you think that that could perhaps predict how for their renegotiating of other pacts and trade deals can go do you think there's a lot riding on how NAFTA goes how it turns out well yes but you know NAFTA itself the record is a little bit mixed there was it in the interest of the average u.s. worker there's different Studies on that and Trump and his base so to speak thought so that this wasn't the case and this goes for other you know bureaucracies the EU being one etc the UN so I agree with your previous guests on this danger of this stratification and the gap between rich and poor but when all should see that this preceded Trump to some degree he's in a sense came on the heels of this polarization society in your society and it's true though that the policies he's pursuing now are not necessarily those that he promised and in terms of serving his base and they may in fact further entrench this financial oligarchy and I think the financial system as a whole is kind of in jeopardy in the future so we'll see if he manages to reign that anything doesn't then I think it might be is undoing as well especially since the stock market now is that it's you know in a complete bubble only preceded by 1987 I think in terms of the way the stocks have you know completely defined valuations of companies so if a crash happens then lord help us in that sense okay mark you will have the final word this is a really good conversation I appreciate all of you joining me today for
