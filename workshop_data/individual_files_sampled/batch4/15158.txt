the mainstream media has just now discovered how illegal asylum seekers have been making their way into Canada through New York State thanks for waking up dinosaur media this is a story we broke here at the rebel well over a year ago according to French language news outlet TV ah pamphlets are floating around Plattsburgh in New York State that are encouraging illegal immigration into Canada those leaflets are being distributed around hotels and in bus stations informing the migrants that are flooding towards the Canadian border about the best ways to submit an asylum application into my very generous country these people aren't real refugees fleeing persecution and death in war-torn hellholes know they're in a safe third country the United States there's no war in the United States well I guess there is there's a president who has a war on illegal immigration immigration fraud and people overseeing their visitors or work visas when the pamphlets tell people about which taxis to take to Rock some Road that's the main illegal entry point into Quebec that's also the place where former rebel reporter faith Goldie was assaulted by an Tifa as right police and reporters looked on and where the RCMP are routinely seen acting as bellhops for illegal migrants it might be the most lawless strip of road in all of Canada anyway the pamphlets describe the cost of the taxi ride and even include information like the numbers for Montreal immigration lawyers and social service agencies an organization called Plattsburgh cares developed the brochure according to them in the hopes of helping migrants and those whose status is threatened in the United States sounds a lot to me like Plattsburgh cares only cares about Plattsburgh because they are deporting all their problematic people into Canada for you and I to take care of honestly someone should arrest these wing nuts because god only know what they're actually sending across the border into Canada we do know that child pornography was carried across the border in one of those luggage bags behind an illegal migrant and through the very great reporting of Toronto Sun journalist Joe Warmington we also know that the federal government has been warning Canadian police services that members of the satanic murderous gang ms-13 are attempting to sneak across the Canadian border and we also know now that because of the migrant crisis developing at the Canadian border Plattsburgh itself has become a hotbed of human trafficking these so-called benevolent no one is illegal immigration organizations are unwittingly providing a how-to manual for human traffickers to smuggle vulnerable women and children across the Canadian border and allow gangs to come into my country now this news would be shocking to you if you've got all your information from the mainstream media but here at the rebel we knew about this over a year ago because we did what no one else was doing and we sent a reporter to the border and then across the border into New York State last year our former rebel reporter faith Goldie went to Plattsburgh in New York and she discovered how taxi companies and a network of people and organizations are aiding and abetting people who are already illegally in the United States to self-deport themselves into Canada and then claim asylum at illegal Canadian border crossings just watch some of the shocking admissions that faith was able to capture on video in her time in Plattsburgh here let's just say we ensure that the people make it across the border safe make it to the border safely the ones that are not here legally and that's what we did everyone that we take up now we bring them in the office we look through a documentation and basically someone like an interview sometimes if our guys are not busy they'll stop by the bus and but that's really rare I think you guys seen one of our guys last night yeah so that was just a regular drive-through for the most part they had their paperwork all set we verify that here before we left and we contacted the other side to make sure that the other side was at the border crow at the rocks and Road so when you see contact either side you mean the Canadian RCMP right I suppose it's nice to see the mainstream media's finally discovering the organizations and businesses and networks who are helping illegal migrants subvert Canadian law from Plattsburgh in New York I guess but they're a little late to the game now aren't they let's not pretend for a second the mainstream media who so carefully watch the rebel and love to report and cry and hand ring when we say what they think are controversial things or when we talk and sound a little less than politically correct the mainstream media never misses any of that but boy they sure turned a blind eye when we were doing the journalism they refused to do at the border I think it's equal parts hate for the rebel and equal parts love for the Liberals in Justin Trudeau that drives the mainstream media's cone of seclusion around these very important stories and issues that we've covered here at the rebel but I guess the good news is as long as the mainstream media continues to filter their news to you I guess I'll always have a job to do and when the next round of mainstream media layoffs claims a few more of these self-censoring journalists they'll all shake their heads and wonder why it's happening to them for the rebel media I'm Shiela gun Reid at the rebel we talk about issues the mainstream media refuses to cover political correctness be damned that's why I'm so excited for our rebel live 2018 conservative conference in Toronto on June 2nd for tickets and details about our conference go to the rebel live.com and if you're not able to make it out to the conference we'll be streaming it live on our website for our premium subscribers go to the rebel live.com for details
