what opportunities are you seeing in alternatives in longshore pairing where are you finding good offsetting positions right so to be sure in the in the period of recent market turbulence in January in February a lot of those strategies didn't quite deliver on that promise there are some that do and there will always be a few that do but that means that it has to be a lot of skill and manager selection and certainly we spend an awful lot of time and a lot of our portfolios reviewing managers reviewing their approaches and trying to select amongst those that we think are going to be best positioned to carry out that task that I've just outlined in our own particular strategies we do think it's non-directional that is we are taking positions that try to remove the direction of equity markets and for the most part the direction of bond markets from returns what we're seeing is is that the dispersion or the difference in performance among stocks in the same industry group and the same sector sometimes in the same style is beginning to diverge that's a good thing that gives us opportunities to try to pick those winners and offset it by some of the weaker performers to generate these sort of uncorrelated strategies it's an ongoing effort there is no magic bullet but it does seem to me it's an appropriate way to take some of your portfolio and reallocate it and when you're looking at stocks overall are what are you most worried about is it pending trade war is it inflation is it valuation levels so at the moment I think it sort of is the change in policy sentiment Tom last year was an unambiguously good policy environment for stocks we had tax reform stroke tax cuts in the United States we had fairly sweeping measures of deregulation that were announced in many cases implemented through executive order those were very business-friendly policies but in 2018 politics in the United States is becoming more partisan unsurprisingly we have midterm elections in the fall that partisanship means that there's no real possibility of legislative action to continue that positive agenda but it also means that there is going to be a more of an appeal to what gut this president elected which is populism and populism is about anger in some parts of the world in some parts the United States I should say about what's going on in terms of economic livelihood and populism is almost always an anti-business message and we're seeing that in the discussions around Amazon coming out of the White House we're seeing it in the trade measures that have been implemented this year and that is unsettling market so I would say in the near term over the next few months it is probably about this shift in policy from being business friendly to being business unfriendly that is of greatest concern to market participants great Larry thank you so much for joining me thank you as well you
