and short users you can now have TYT the palm of your hand our TYT app is available for download in the Google Play Store just go to T y-t-dot-com slash app to find out more the Trump administration announced that they are going to do short-term health insurance they're going to expand it e used to be a but hardly anyone use it cuz it's kind of useless in that window now they're going to allow for a whole year now to be fair to them but it is significantly cheaper than regular health insurance now the part they don't tell you is it's significantly cheaper it because you get almost nothing so they'll take your money and you'll get almost no insurance in return so first of all they can under these new plans pre-existing conditions are back so they can deny you if you've got a pre-existing condition including acne I don't know who they're gonna have his clients allergies that's right and and if you there's caps on how much you can spend in the year so if you've got a you know we've got a cold you might be okay although it doesn't cover prescription drugs either so that's all out-of-pocket so I'd really don't know what you're buying but if you've got cancer and and it runs over like well sad day you passed your limit I guess it's time for you to die and and if you get a condition within the year well sad day for you again we're done with you so that's not really insurance it's a trap and they're so loosely regulated that they're and I'm not making this up there are some of these plans right skinny insurance plans where they can even decide which days of the week you can get treatment so based on what some of the wording says for some of these plans you can only get treatment Monday through Wednesday but any other day sorry mmm-hmm that's it one more on that I mean that's so unbelievable some you can't get treatment during the weekend at all so if you got hurt during the weekend try not to bleed out okay but we'll get to you on Monday first thing probably and then they talk about Oh socialized medicine there's two it takes too long but if you have cancer in some of these plans within the first month of the plan they will not treat you yeah but wait I do if I have cancer its growing inside of me we got to go right now but I'm sorry doesn't cover that so just wait we'll treat you a month from now it's the equivalent of payday lender insurance plans yeah it's predatory it is exclusively an explicitly for-profit and it has absolutely no real incentive to actually spend this money your money that you're spending every single month on health care I think it says here about six only sixty-five percent of the money that you pay into this plan might actually potentially go to health care costs which is much much lower than the 80% mandated by the ACA yeah a good sign that this is a scam is that the insurance companies are incentivized greatly to push to push them on customers because of what you just said they can keep that other 35% in profit rather than having to have dedicated to go ethically so yeah this seems like just a giant giant scam yeah and under Obamacare there was a lot of issues of the Obamacare but one of them was they said hey you actually have to spend the money that people pay into health insurers yeah for their health so you can keep 20% but 80% has to be actually spent for health otherwise this scam the Trump administration says scammed if somebody says ok no you don't have to spend 80% it's up to you and so now they're lowering it it might be even lower than 65% in some of the cases some the profit margin might be up to 50% that's why they're paying 20% Commission to the brokers instead of 5% normal they like push this product cuz all we do is make money off of it we don't actually provide any insurance and by the way if you're a woman good luck it doesn't cover prenatal or maternity care so I'm sure though that the right wing is outrageous I know that they don't like gender inequality so they're like what is this is not fair to women on it actually she's very concerned about how women are being treated in this health care market but I will say that there there is something to be said here in that they are targeting the people who are failed by the Affordable Care Act so the people which you know I have experience with folks like those because the ACA implants in New York you're talking about a minimum of paying $200 a month for an $8,000 deductible and you go to the doctor you have to pay the thing outright there's no kind of copay system and some of these plans so you can't afford it you know you're talking about spending thousands of dollars per year before you're even covered by insurance on some of these market exchange programs these folks what that does that it creates a window of predation and so these folks come in and say ah well I have a better deal for you and it makes you feel like you're covered by insurance when in actuality or not and it really all of these things put together really kind of point to the need for why single-payer is the best solution here in this country yeah and so in single-payer even according to the Koch brothers own paid for study ooop still like it costs thirty two point six trillion dollars except the current health care system cost over thirty three trillion dollars and by most estimates medicare for all saves two trillion dollars two for the economy and it covers us all right now unfortunately under the Affordable Care Act fifteen point five percent of the country has no insurance at all so instead of giving them fake insurance like this which is a makes them maybe feel a little bit better if they're not sick but Bor god help you if you do get sick not only you're in are you gonna not have insurance under this plan one of the analysts said whatever you do you must read the fine print if you don't read the fine print you're not gonna realize that you're really not covered from watch at all and if you do get sick under this at the end of the year you're in a world of hurt and then you're not gonna be able to get insurance after that we're back to the bad old days so why not fix it and save trillions of dollars yeah the end of the day this goes to show that you can tinker as much as you want but if you don't remove the profit motive from health care something that people need that everybody needs if you don't like this this kind of thing always crashes up against that reality you know where they try to find ways to provide health care with a profit incentive and at the end of the day it's just I'm profitable to cover a huge amount of people so this goes to show that the at the end of the day just becomes a scam that you know takes advantage of people and so just lastly on this look I unbeliever that you need the profit motive to make sneakers to make but when it's your life online cops firemen and health care if you or by the way imprisoning people right right if you if you do profit motive on that let's take the firemen as an example well I'm not going to pull out your house fire on your house if you don't have enough money yeah I mean that's got two problems one it's deeply immoral number two it's gonna spread okay which is also true in health care sometimes diseases spread if they're not treated and so there are things that the private market should handle but there are things that we have decided the government should handle like cops firemen and health care is our right to live just like those other issues yeah one of the things that we often say and that I've kind of talked about on the stump is that suffering should not be a for-profit enterprise in the United States and in industries where human suffering is at stake we have entire industries that prop up that suffering because the demand is inelastic you will pay an infinite amount of money to not die and when you come in with that that just creates a natural incentive for predation it creates an incentive to keep people sick and in huge markets like that we have to have at a minimum certain public options depending on the industry but when we talk about things like private prisons that should not exist in the United States a single-payer health care should be the system that we have in the United States and you know it's just that is the moral thing that is the moral truth that we shouldn't permit for-profit suffering in this country two easy ways for young turks one is hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do
