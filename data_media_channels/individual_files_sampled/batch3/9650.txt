NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT, EVERYONE. ♪ ♪ Tucker: GOOD EVENING, AND WELCOME TO "TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT." WE HAVE SAD NEWS. WRITER, PHYSICIAN, AND LONGTIME CONTRIBUTOR CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER DIED TODAY AT THE AGE OF 68. HE LEAVES BEHIND HIS WIFE, HE MADE IN 1964, AND THEIR SON, DANIEL. ALSO MOURNING HIS DEATH ARE HIS MANY FRIENDS AT THIS NETWORK AND MILLIONS OF VIEWERS WHO KNEW AND LOVED CHARLES FROM WATCHING HIM EVERY NIGHT AS THEY DID. ASK ANY FOX ANCHOR, WHO IS THE PERSON PEOPLE AT THE AIRPORT ASK ABOUT THE MOST, EVERY SINGLE ONE WILL TELL YOU, CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER. FOX VIEWERS LOVED CHARLES, AND IT WASN'T BECAUSE HE PANDERED TO THEM. HE DIDN'T. SOMETIMES HE TOOK POSITIONS THEY DISLIKED OR HATED, BUT VIEWERS NOT ONLY FORGIVE HIM FOR DOING THAT, THEY SEEMED TO LOVE HIM MORE. THEY COULD SEE HIS BRILLIANCE BUT THEY COULD ALSO FEEL HIS SINCERITY. CHARLES ALWAYS SAID WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS TRUE. HE WAS AN HONEST AND GENUINELY DECENT MAN AND IT SHONE THROUGH. CHARLES ALSO MAY BE THE BRAVEST MAN I MET PERSONALLY. IT TAKES COURAGE TO STAY CHEERFUL AND HUMANE FOR 68 YEARS, DOUBLY SO GIVEN THE REMARKABLE CHALLENGES THAT HE FACED IN THE LAST 44 OF THOSE YEARS. BUT HE DID IT. CHARLES WAS TOTALLY
