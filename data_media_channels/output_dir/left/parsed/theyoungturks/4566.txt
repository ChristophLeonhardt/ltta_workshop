IN EL SALVADOR, TEEN RAPE VICTIM
HAS RECEIVED 30 YEARS IN
PRISON AFTER A STILLBIRTH THAT
RESULTED FROM HER RAPE.
HER NAME IS EVELYN BEECHER'S
HERNANDEZ CRUISE.
SHE GAVE BIRTH INTO A
TOILET IN APRIL 2016
AFTER FALLING ILL WITH ACUTE
BACK AND STOMACH PAIN.
PREVIOUS TO THAT, SHE HAD BEEN
REPEATEDLY RAPED BY A GANG
MEMBER OVER SEVERAL MONTHS AS
PART OF A FORCED SEXUAL
RELATIONSHIP.
EVEN BEFORE YOU FIND THAT WINDS
UP HAPPENING, THAT IS AN
INCREDIBLY DARK AND SERIOUS
SITUATION THAT SHE'D BEEN
INVOLVED IN.
NOW AFTER GIVING BIRTH, SHE WAS
ARRESTED WHEN PEOPLE WHEN
POLICE FOUND THE DECEASED PEDIS
IN THE TOILET.
SHE'S BEEN A WEEK HANDCUFFED TO
A HOSPITAL BED BALL BEING
TREATED FOR SEVERE ANEMIA AND A
URINARY TRACT INFECTION AND
HAS BEEN DETAINED EVER SINCE.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OVER YOUR
DETAINMENT BUT IMAGINE
AGAIN, BEFORE WE EVEN GET TO
THAT LEGAL REPERCUSSIONS,
SHE HAS A LONG PERIOD OF
REPEATED RAPES, SHE HAS A
TERRIBLE SITUATION, THE HEALTH
PROBLEMS THAT RESULT FROM IT,
AND THEY HANDCUFFED HER TO THE
BED LIKE SHOULD BROKEN THE LAW.
OF COURSE, IN EL SALVADOR,
ABORTION IN ALL CASES AND
ILLEGAL SO SHE HAD ALTHOUGH
SHE HAD ONLY BROKEN EL
SALVADOR'S LAWS NOT ANY MORAL OR
ETHICAL LAW.
SHE IS OF GOING TO COURT.
THE FEMALE JUDGE ACCEPTED THE
PROSECUTOR'S CLAIMS THAT
HERNANDEZ FELT TO SEEK ANTENATAL
HERE BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT
THE BABY AND THREW HIM INTO THE
TOILET INTENDING TO KILL HIM.
AND SENSING SENTENCING THE JUDGE
WENT FURTHER AND SUGGESTED
THAT HERNANDEZ CANNOT OF ENACTED
ALONE AND THAT HER MOTHER
MAY ALSO BECOMINGLY RESPONSIBLE
BECAUSE TAKING THIS GIRL
WHO HAD BEEN RAPED MULTIPLE
TIMES AND THROWING HER IN
JAIL FOR 30 YEARS ISN'T ENOUGH
JUSTICE FOR THEM AT THIS POINT.
THEY WANT TO GO FARTHER
POSSIBLY.
FRANCISCO, I KNOW YOU ACTUALLY
WENT DOWN THERE AND TALK TO HER.
JUST WANT TO MAKE ONE THING
CLEAR BEFORE WE GO TO THAT.
IF YOU THINK, YOU BELIEVE THE
FACT PATTERN THAT SHE DELIVERED
THE BABY AND THEN THREW IN THE
TOILET, THEN THAT WOULD BE
MURDER.
THE THING IS, IN THIS CASE, THE
MEDICAL EXPERTS WERE UNABLE TO
ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE FETUS DIED
IN UTERO OR IN THE MOMENTS
RIGHT AFTER DELIVERY, SO THAT
MEANS, OBVIOUSLY EL
SALVADOR HAS DIFFERENT LEGAL
STANDARDS IN AMERICA IT'S
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT.
THAT SHOULD SHE READ THERE THAT
THEY DID NOT HAVE EVIDENCE
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THAT
SHE HAD DONE THAT.
SHE TESTIFIED AND EVERYONE ELSE
AROUND HER SAID NO, THAT IS
NOT WHAT HAPPENED.
SHE
HAD ABDOMINAL PAIN, DIDN'T
EVEN KNOW THAT'S WHAT WAS
HAPPENING IN HER MONTAGUE
TO THE HOSPITAL AND THEN THEY
REALIZED ALL MY GOD, SHE TO
STILLBIRTH AND THAT IS WHAT
HAD GONE INTO THE TOILET I
DON'T KNOW DO BELIEVE THERE
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT
MEDICAL EXPERTS SAID THERE IS NO
WAY OF KNOWING SO THERE'S
NO WAY OF KNOWING, YOU'RE GOING
TO CHARGE HER WITH MURDER?
THE ENTIRE CONTEXT, IN EL
SALVADOR, THIS IS ONLY
CASEY COULD GO WELL, HE SAID,
SHE SAID.
WE CAN'T QUITE TELL.
NO, THEY'VE DONE THIS TO DOZENS
OF WOMEN, FOR STILLBIRTH,
FOR ABORTIONS, LOCKING THEM UP
FOR A LONG TIME.
ACTUALLY, HUNDRED AND 50
WOMEN HAVE BEEN PROSECUTED
FOR ABORTIONS WHEN THEY HAVE HAD
MISCARRIAGES.
I ACTUALLY MET EVELYN WHO IS
RIGHT NOW 19 AND WHEN I MET
HER IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR, I
WAS DOWN THERE FOR A STORY
FOR NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC CHANNEL,
ON THEIR SHOW EXPLORER, WE DID
A WHOLE SEGMENT ON IT, SHE HAD
ARTIE BEEN IN THIS OVERCROWDED
PRISON IN EL SALVADOR FOR EIGHT
MONTHS AWAITING THIS SENTENCE.
SHE TOLD ME, SHE'S CHOKING BACK
TEARS THAT SHE WAS RAPED AND
THAT SHE DIDN'T KNOW THAT SHE
WAS PREGNANT AND SO INTEL SHE
MISCARRIED, AND THIS HAPPENS ALL
THE TIME, AND YOU THINK IT'S
RIDICULOUS, AND THEN YOU LIKE
HOW DID YOU KNOW.
HOW DOES THE MEDICAL EXAMINER
NO?
IT'S ILLEGAL.
THAT
MIGHT BE DRACONIAN WHICH I
BELIEVE THAT IT IS, BUT HOW DO
YOU KNOW?
ACTUALLY, IT IS VERY DIFFICULT
TO TELL WHETHER THERE HAS
BEEN AN ABORTION OR A
MISCARRIAGE.
YOU CAN'T TELL UNLESS THERE'S
LESIONS OR WHATEVER IT IS, BUT
IT IS ACTUALLY VERY DIFFICULT TO
TELL AND SHE IS NOT THE FIRST
WOMAN TO HAVE BEEN SENTENCED OUT
THERE 17 WOMEN RIGHT NOW WHO ARE
LANGUISHING IN PRISON WHO ARE
WAITING AND THEY ARE CONTESTING
THEIR CASES AND THERE'S
BASICALLY ONE OR TWO LAWYERS TO
REPRESENT THEM, ONE GUY NAMED
DENNIS MUNOZ BUT THE REASON EL
SALVADOR MATTERS FOR AMERICANS
IS THAT IT IS A GLIMPSE INTO
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU START TO
ROLL BACK ABORTION LAWS.
WHEN YOU START TO TAKE AWAY THE
RIGHT TO CHOOSE, THERE IS
NO STOPPING IT AND IT SNOWBALLS.
FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN YOU START TO
SAY HEY, WE NEED TO HAVE, WE CAN
RESTRICT THE ABORTIONS AT THE
SECOND TRIMESTER, THE FIRST
TRIMESTER, THEN WE GO BACK, THEN
WE GO TO THE HEARTBEAT, AND THEN
YEAH, THE LINE BETWEEN WHAT IS
AN ABORTION AND WHAT IS
CONSIDERED MURDER IS COMPLETELY
BLURRED AND WHAT IS THE
RESULT OF THAT IS WOMEN ARE
SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS.
THIS WOMAN WAS NOT LISTEN TO.
SHE WAS NOT BELIEVED WHAT THE
LAWYER TOLD ME THERE IS THAT
OFTENTIMES JUDGES ARE, HAVE NO
UNDERSTANDING THAT IT IS
DIFFICULT TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN AN ABORTION AND A
MISCARRIAGE WHICH IS WHY THERE
SENTENCING THESE WOMEN WHO
MISCARRIED TO PRISON TIME.
THEY MAY NOT CARE.
RIGHT.
IS GIVE THAT MORE CONTEXT,
TOO.
YOU MIGHT THINK, SHE DIDN'T KNOW
SHE WAS PREGNANT?
COME ON.
NO, WE'VE ACTUALLY COVERED A
LOT OF STORIES ON THE SHOW
ABOUT WOMEN WHO DIDN'T KNOW THEY
WERE PREGNANT THAT IT DIDN'T
LEAD TO THIS KIND OF SITUATION
NORMALLY, ALTHOUGH, ONE OF THE
STORIES RECOVERED ON THE AIR WAS
A WOMAN HE WENT TO THE BATHROOM,
DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS PREGNANT AND
A BABY DROPPED OUT AND SHE WAS
LIKE OH MY GOD AND SHE PICKED UP
THE BABY AND THE BABY IS FINE.
TOTALLY DIFFERENT CASE, BUT IT
DOES HAPPEN FROM TIME TO
TIME AND ON THE MISCARRIAGE AND
ABORTION, PEOPLE WHO ARE
PRO-LIFE MY TURN AROUND AND GO
MAYBE SOME OF THOSE WERE
NOT MISCARRIAGES, THEY WERE
ACTUALLY ABORTIONS BECAUSE
YOU CAN'T TELL AND HENCE THEY
SHOULD BE PUNISHED WITH 30
YEARS IN PRISON.
OKAY.
I DON'T KNOW THAT ALL OF YOU
THINK THAT EVEN IF YOU ARE
PRO-LIFE BUT OBVIOUSLY SOME
PEOPLE IN EL SALVADOR, THE
GOVERNMENT DOES.
ALSO, IT MIGHT NOT OF BEEN AN
ABORTION.
IT MIGHT'VE BEEN A MISCARRIAGE.
HOW MANY WOMEN ARE ROTTING IN
PRISON IN EL SALVADOR
BECAUSE THEY HAD A MISCARRIAGE?
JESUS.
WHICH BRINGS US BACK TO JESUS.
NOW THAT I'VE GIVEN YOU THE FULL
CONTEXT OF IT AND THE UPS AND
DOWNS AND BOTH SIDES, LET ME
JUST SAY WE KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED IN EL SALVADOR ON A BIG
PICTURE.
CATHOLIC GROUPS CAME IN AND
FUNDED A DRIVE TO PASS THIS LAW.
IT WAS BACKGROUND 97 OR SO THAT
THIS HAPPENED, IN THE LATE
1990S SO ALMOST 20
YEARS AGO AND THE POPULATION IS
ACTUALLY NOT IN FAVOR OF IT.
THERE IS A PUSH RIGHT NOW TO AT
LEAST GET AN EXEMPTION FOR
RAPE, IF THE MOTHER'S LIFE IS
IN DANGER AND ONE OTHER
EXCEPTION BUT THE GOVERNMENT
WON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
THEY REFUSE TO HAVE A VOTE SO
FAR FOR FOUR MONTHS AS
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PUSHING FOR
THIS SO RELIGIOUS GROUPS
CAME IN AND SAID MISCARRIAGE,
YOU KNOW, STILLBIRTH, WHATEVER.
NO EXCEPTIONS.
PUT THEM IN PRISON FOR 30 YEARS
IF THEY GET AN ABORTION.
IN MIND YOU, JUST UP WITH
SOME CONTEXT ON THIS ALSO,
EL SALVADOR IS ONE OF THE MOST
DANGEROUS COUNTRIES IN THE
WORLD AND ALSO IT HAS THE
HIGHEST RATE OF THEM ASIDE
WHICH IS MURDER OF WOMEN IN THE
WORLD.
THERE'S A REASON THAT THERE IS
A MASS INFLUX OF PEOPLE
SEEKING ASYLUM REALLY,
IMMIGRANTS COMING INTO
MEXICO COMING INTO UNITED STATES
FROM EL SALVADOR.
IT IS NOT A GOOD PLACE TO BE A
WOMAN, TO BE ANYONE.
THERE'S A LOT OF GANG VIOLENCE,
AS WAS EXPERIENCED BY EVELYN
HERE, I THINK THE OTHER THING TO
MENTION IS THERE IS ANOTHER BILL
FROM THE RIGHT WING PARTY RIGHT
NOW.
I MET WITH A GUY WHO WAS DRAWING
IT UP.
HE WANTS TO FURTHER CRIMINALIZE
ABORTION TO BE AN AUTOMATIC
LIFE SENTENCE.
30 YEARS IS NOT ENOUGH.
KNOW, YOU COULD GET OUT.
MEANWHILE, I MET A YOUNG WOMAN
WHO WAS SENTENCED TO 30 YEARS,
ANOTHER WOMAN, WAS SENTENCE, HAD
A 33-YEAR-OLD SON WHEN SHE WAS
SENTENCED AND SHE WAS I BELIEVE
SOMETHING LIKE AROUND 20.
SHE'S BEEN IN THERE FOR 10 YEARS
ALREADY.
HER SON IS 13.
THIS IS THE PRO-LIFE
POSITION.
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS.
AGAIN, THE SLIPPERY SLOPE.
I THINK WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHAT
THAT MEANS FOR US IN THE UNITED
STATES, THIS IS WHY WE NEED TO
DEFEND ABORTION RIGHTS.
WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE PRO-LIFE
OR PRO-CHOICE, THIS IS HOW
YOUR CONE UNIT CAN GET, WHEN A
MOTHER'S LIFE, ANOTHER
SITUATION WHERE A MOTHER HAS
LEUKEMIA AND NEEDS TREATMENT.
WELL, SHE IS PREGNANT AND SHE
CAN'T.
THAT BABY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BE
CARRIED TO TERM.
THERE'S NO WAY THIS BABY IS
SURVIVING.
WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO IN EL
SALVADOR?
THE MOTHER HAS TO CARRY THE BABY
TO TERM.
SHE WILL DIE, THE FETUS WILL
DIE, BUT GOD WINS?
I DON'T KNOW.
THAT WAS ANOTHER CASE.
JUDGE HAD A RULE AND THEN
FINALLY THIS WOMAN'S LIFE
WAS SAVED BUT ONLY, AND THIS IS
CRAZY, IF SHE HAD A CESAREAN.
SO THAT IT WAS LIKE A BIRTH, BUT
NOT.
SHE COULDN'T HAVE A REGULAR
ABORTION.
IT WASN'T A
MEDICAL ABORTION.
IT WAS
NECESSARY AND -
I'M SURE SHE WAS AN AMAZING
SHAPE TO HAVE SURGERY
PERFORMED ON HER.
RIGHT, SUFFERING FROM
LEUKEMIA.
I DO NOT WISH BEING A WOMAN IN
EL SALVADOR ON ANYONE.
THAT COUNTRY ABSOLUTELY
NEEDS OUR SOLITARY AND
SUPPORT.
WHICH LEADS ME TO MY FINAL POINT
WHICH IS EVERYONE'S A WHILE
IN THIS COUNTRY, JUSTIFIABLY,
PEOPLE SAY OH MY GOD, LOOK
AT THE WAY RADICAL MUSLIMS KEEP
TREAT WOMEN, WHETHER IT'S
THE TALIBAN AND IN AFGHANISTAN
OR OUR ALLIES LIKE SAUDI ARABIA.
WELL, THERE'S CHRISTIANS SHARIA
LAW AS WELLNESS CHRISTIAN
TALIBAN AS WELL AND THEY TREAT
WOMEN HORRIBLY AS WELL LIKE
IN CASES LIKE THIS.
AND IF YOU ARE OFFENDED THAT I
AM CALLING A CHRISTIAN
SHARIA LAW, THAT IS A SAD DAY
FOR YOU.
THAT IS LITERALLY WHAT IT IS.
SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT
CHRISTIANS AND DON'T BELIEVE
WHAT YOU BELIEVE, I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOUR RELIGION IS.
I DON'T CARE THAT MUSLIMS
THINK I SHOULDN'T DRAW THE
PROPHET MOHAMMED, THAT'S YOUR
OPINION AND I'M NOT MUSLIM.
YOU THINK WOMEN SHOULDN'T HAVE
AN ABORTION.
THEN YOU DON'T HAVE AN ABORTION.
I AM NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR
SHARIA LAW WHETHER YOU ARE
MUSLIM OR CATHOLIC.
IN THIS CASE IT WAS THE CATHOLIC
CHURCH SPECIFICALLY PUSH
FORWARD ON THIS BILL.
BY THE WAY, YOU ARE EVEN RUN BY
YOUR OWN BIBLE TAUGHT IN
THE BIBLE, HE SAYS IT IS
PRO-ABORTION.
GOD SAYS IF YOUR WIFE CHEATED ON
YOU, GIVE HER A POTION AND
IF USE IF YOU THINK SHE CHEATED
ON YOU AND IF SHE ABORTS
THE BABY, GREAT, AND MEAN SHE
DID CHEAT ON YOU AND IT'S A
GOOD THING WE KILLED THAT BABY.
READ THE BIBLE, IT IS THE
NUMBERS.
I DIDNíT SAY THAT,
GOD SAID THAT.
