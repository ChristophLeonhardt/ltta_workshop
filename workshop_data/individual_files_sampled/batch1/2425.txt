the reality is that one of the reasons that Trump got elected and brexit and the other referendum and votes we've seen is a lot of people have not been participating in this growing pie and there's disillusionment there's anger people are saying rightly the system isn't working for them unfortunately a lot of solutions and proposals of her put forth are not the ones that are going to make people better off blaming immigration or globalization is not the essence of what's going on here for that matter blaming technology is not the essence technology is making the pie bigger the question is can we put in a system that gives people the education that which the kind of entrepreneurship and job creation that has the kind of income and tax policies that lead to widely shared prosperity I believe we can and I hope that we don't end up demonizing technology trade or immigration that would be a step backwards
