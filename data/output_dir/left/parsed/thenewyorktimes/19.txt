: “It’s
Friday, Friday.”
Remember Rebecca Black?
She was the 13-year-old girl
who made a music video with
her friends about —
: “Friday, Friday.”
— Fridays.
: “Friday, Friday,
Friday, Friday, Friday,
Friday, Friday.”
Now, years after being
tossed around the internet
as a viral spectacle,
Rebecca seems
to have found a kind of
peaceful equilibrium.
She’s reemerged on a
new platform, Cameo.
It’s a service
that lets fans pay
low- to mid-range
celebrities to send them
personalized video messages.
“Hi, Sarah.
What’s up, Steven?
Hi, Tanya!”
Fans approach
Rebecca to wring out
the last drops of her
fame, and she responds
with acceptance and grace.
“Happy birthday.”
She even performs a ukulele
version of the song for them.
: “Friday, Friday.”
For that, she gets 30 bucks.
And her fan?
Her fan gets to perform a kind
of celebrity ventriloquism.
With Cameo, you can
almost project your voice
through a celebrity host.
“What’s going on, Caroline?
It is Lance Bass.”
“Caitlyn Jenner here.”
“What’s up?
It’s Mike Vick.”
You write the
script, they say it.
“Fish.
I guess your name is Fish.”
“It’s your birthday.”
“It’s your bar mitzvah.”
“Mazel tov.”
“I hear that you’re
about to retire.
Good for you.”
It’s like the “Being
John Malkovich” of apps,
and it represents this
totally new frontier
in fan-celebrity relations.
Traditionally, a celebrity
encounter works one way:
We recognize a
famous person and they
have no idea who we are.
Receiving a Cameo
simulates the feeling
of being recognized back.
“Hey, Amanda.”
“Hello, Amanda.”
“Hey, Amanda.”
“What up, Amanda?”
Hey, guys.
I just bought a whole
bunch of Cameos for myself.
And because I’m a sadist,
I paid them all to say —
“Peter Piper.”
“Peter Piper.”
“Peter Piper.”
“Peter Piper
picked a peck of —”
“Pickled peppers.”
“Pickled peppers.”
“Pickled peppers.
How’d he do that?
I don’t know.”
We commoners have always had
an ambivalent relationship
with the stars.
“Leave Britney alone!”
We admire them
and we resent them.
We want to be more
like them and we
want them to be
more like us.
On the internet,
a famous person
is no longer just an
idol for us to inspect.
They become a skin to inhabit.
This impulse can express
itself pretty innocently,
like in the celebrity
fan fiction that
just wants to imagine
famous people falling in love
and kissing each other.
“What’s up, guys?
It’s Shawn Mendes, and I’m
about to read a fan fiction
about me called, ‘A
Shawn Mendes Love Story.’”
But if we used to do that by
Xeroxing fanzines or starting
fan clubs —
“The Mr. Belvedere Fun Kit!”
— now that process feels
a lot more immediate
and powerful, too.
At its most extreme,
fan-generated content can be
super creepy, like when a
community of Redditors used
machine learning to
create deep fakes —
highly realistic
fake porn that
grafts Hollywood
actresses’ faces
onto porn performers’ bodies.
It’s no longer enough to
feel like a contributor
to a celebrity image.
We want the sensation of
pulling their strings.
The internet gives us the
tools to build stars up
and to tear them down.
And those tools
can be so powerful
that they can disrupt
the celebrity’s
official image-making machine.
After a bunch of trolls started
spreading lies on Twitter
that painted the beloved
14-year-old actress
Millie Bobby Brown as a bigot,
she deleted her account.
Celebrities used to cut
deals with the tabloids,
offering access to avert
more damaging storylines.
Now they’re negotiating
directly with the public.
Internet-savvy celebrities
submit themselves
to fan access in
controlled ways.
They release
Instagram filters to let
you wear their famous face.
They literally deliver
presents to your house
and film it for YouTube.
Cameo represents
the height of this —
famous people actually
accepting real money
to say what we
want them to.
“You are a great dancer.”
“You are a cool mom.”
“You are the best there is.”
“And you are amazing parents.”
“That’s cool.”
There’s something a
little sad about that —
that we want them to do
this and that they will.
Famous people are less famous
than they have ever been.
It almost feels like we’re
on the same level now —
them and us.
“Don’t know why
I just did this.
Anyways.”
Except they’re the
ones making 30 bucks.
“Bye.
Bye, bye!
Bye.”
“Hey, I’m Amanda.”
“I’m Shane.”
“He edits the videos.”
“She writes the videos”
“You watch the videos.’
“And if you like the video,
like, comment and subscribe here.”
“And then tell us:
How are you dehumanizing
your favorite celebrity?”
“Quite viciously, myself.
Leave your answer here in the comments.”
“We are very thirsty.”
“Internetting
with Amanda Hess.”
