Dana: AS WE WAIT FOR THE WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING TO BEGIN WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT DEMOCRATS HOPING FOR A BLUE WAVE IN NOVEMBER. WE ARE SEEING SIGNS IT COULD BE MORE LIKE A RIPPLE. TY MATSDORF IS THE FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE 2016 DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE. AND COLIN REED IS A COLUMNIST FOR THE "BOSTON HERALD." THANK YOU BEING HERE. THEY SAY MAKING THE PREDICTIONS IN THE HOUSE THE DEMOCRATS WILL GAIN BETWEEN 25 TO 30 SEATS IN THE HOUSE. AND COOK PREDICTS THAT DEMOCRATS WILL GAIN AS MANY AS TWO SEATS IN THE SENATE. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE PREDICTIONS? IT'S EARLY FOR THE PREDICTIONS. Dana: WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT. OF COURSE. THERE IS A SAYING, "GOOD POLICY IS GOOD POLITICS." THIS WEEK REPUBLICANS HAD A GOOD WEEK. POLICY SIDE PRESIDENT HAD A TRIUMPH IN NORTH KOREA AS WELL AS THE IRAN DEAL. GETTING OUT OF THAT WILL FIRE UP HIS BASE. IN THE POLITICAL FRONT, CRISIS WAS AVERTED IN WEST VIRGINIA. WE HAVE A STRONG CANDIDATE TO CHALLENGE JOE MANCHIN AND THE BATTLEFIELD WILL SHIFT TO RED PART OF THE COUNTRY WHERE THE REPUBLICANS HAVE STRONG CHALLENGERS TO TAKE ON THE INCUMBENT DEMOCRAT SENATORS. Dana: TODAY THE PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT LOWERING DRUG PRICES. ALSO WE HAVE THIS FROM NANCY PELOSI. LISTEN TO THIS ABOUT HOW SHE SAYS THE DEMOCRATS ARE WINNING THE TAX WAR. THEY ARE LOSING THE PUBLIC RELATIONS SIDE. THEY WON THE VOTE. THEY HAD THE VOTE. THEY WON THE VOTE. BUT THEY HAVE NOT WON THE PUBLIC OPINION OF IT BECAUSE THE EXPERIENCE THAT PEOPLE HAVE IS SOMETHING VERY CONTRARY TO THE MISREPRESENTATIONS THEY HAVE MADE ABOUT IT. Dana: I WANT TO CHECK MY GUT INSTINCT ON THIS WITH YOU. SOMETHING TELLS ME MAYBE SHE KNOWS SOMETHING THAT REPUBLICANS DON'T. I THINK THAT WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IN POLLING IS THAT PEOPLE JUST AREN'T FEELING THE EFFECTS OF IT. YOU HAVE REPUBLICAN OUTSIDE GROUPS SPENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A WEEK TO TRY TO PROMOTE THE BILL. NOT GETTING ABOVE 50%. I DON'T WANT TO BELITTLE PEOPLE'S PAYCHECK. $50, $100 MEANS A LOT TO A LOT OF PEOPLE. WHEN THEY SEE COMPANIES LIKE SHELDON ADELSON MAKING $1 BILLION IN PROFIT IT SEEMS SKEWED. Dana: SO DO YOU THINK THE DEMOCRATS ARE SMART TO RUN ON A MESSAGE LIKE WHAT SHE IS SAYING TO ROLL BACK WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ABLE TO GET DONE ON TAXES? I THINK IT'S RIGHT. PEOPLE'S POCKETBOOK WILL BE THE ISSUE THIS CYCLE. IF YOU SAY THE REPUBLICANS HAVE ALL THE POWER AND WHAT DID THEY DO? THEY GAVE HUGE TAX CUTS TO BIG CORPORATIONS. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S MORE BALANCE TO FOCUS ON FOLKS LIKE YOU. I THINK THAT IS A GOOD STRONG ECONOMIC ARGUMENT THAT WORKS IN BLUE DISTRICTS, RED DISTRICTS, PURPLE DISTRICTS. Dana: IF PEOPLE ARE FEELING LIKE THE ECONOMY IS BETTER, YOU SEE THE RIGHT TRACK, WRONG TRACK NUMBERS IMPROVING FOR THE REPUBLICANS AND FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. THEY ARE FEELING GOOD ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY. THE PRESIDENT'S POLL NUMBERS ARE RISING. ARE THE DEMOCRATS GOING TO BE PREPARED TO DEAL WITH IT IF HE ACTUALLY GETS ABOVE 50%? IT LOOKS LIKE HE WILL HAVE A GOOD SUMMER. I DON'T THINK IT'S ANY SURPRISE TO ANYONE WHO STUDIED NANCY PELOSI SHE WANTS TO RAISE TAXES. IT'S MORE PERPLEXING SHE WOULD ANNOUNCE IT TO THE WORLD TO GIVE HER POLITICAL OPPONENTS WHAT TO USE AGAINST HER. PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE HIGHER TAXES. Dana: LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE THAT HAPPENED TODAY THAT YOU TOLD ME ABOUT TODAY. THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION, F.E.C., MAKING A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT. I WANT YOUR TAKE ON IT. THEY SAID THIS IS A CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE GRANISURELY ON THE CHILD CARE BATTLE SAYING WE WON, THANK YOU TO THE COMMISSIONERS FOR THE UNANIMOUS VOTE TO USE THE FUNDS FOR CHILD CARE. THIS IS A GAME CHANGER FOR WOMEN AND PARENTS CONSIDERING A RUN FOR OFFICE. HOW BIG OF A DEAL OF THIS IF YOU ARE TRYING TO RECRUIT YOUNGER PEOPLE TO RUN FOR OFFICE? THIS IS HUGE. WHEN PEOPLE ARE ASKED TO RUN FOR OFFICE OFTENTIMES THEY GIVE UP THEIR JOB AND THEY CAN'T WORK FULL TIME. IF YOU THINK VIRGINIA TEN, ONE OF THE MOST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS. FEW YOU A YOUNG FAMILY YOU PAY UP TO $5,000 A MONTH FOR CHILD CARE. IF YOU USE THE CAMPAIGN FUNDS, WE SHOULD LOWER THE BARRIER. NOT BEING PERSONALLY WEALTHY SHOULDN'T KEEP YOU FROM RUNNING. AND IT SAYS SOMETHING THEY APPROVED THIS. Dana: ARE YOU SURPRISED BY THIS? A RARE MOMENT TO HAVE A BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT THAT THIS IS A GOOD THING. MORE WOMEN RUNNING FOR OFFICE IS GOOD FOR BOTH PARTIES AND LOWERING THE BARIER FOR WOMEN WHO WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN POLITICS IS A GOOD THING. Dana: HAD THIS BEEN CHALLENGED BEFORE? YEAH. IN 1995, THERE WAS A MALE CANDIDATE WHO ASKED TO USE CHILD CARE WHEN HIS WIFE TRAVELED WITH HIM. BUT LET'S BE HONEST. IN 2018, MEN WORK, WOMEN WORK. THIS BENEFITS ANYBODY THAT HAS A YOUNG FAMILY. Dana: INTERESTING. I ALSO WANT TO ASK ABOUT CALIFORNIA. I'M FASCINATED BY THE JUNGLE PRIMARY SITUATION. AND THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE SO MANY CANDIDATES RUNNING THAT THEY COULD SPLIT THE VOTE SO MUCH THAT THE TOP TWO VOTE-GETTERS COULD BE REPUBLICANS AND THE DEMOCRATS COULD BE BOXED OUT. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS? LOOK. THIS IS A BIG CHALLENGE FOR THE DEMOCRATS THIS CYCLE. USUALLY ENTHUSIASM AND TOO MUCH ENTHUSIASM, YOU CAN'T HAVE ENOUGH. BUT THIS IS ONE CASE LOOK, I SAW YESTERDAY ON THE SHOW YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT IT. YOU HAVE TO PICK A HORSE AND TRY TO GET THEM THROUGH. Dana: CAN THE REPUBLICANS EXPLOIT THIS? I AGREE WITH TY. THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM FOR DEMOCRATS. Dana: WHAT CAN REPUBLICANS DO TO TRY TO FIX IT? CALIFORNIA IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE TOUGH SLEDDING, NO MATTER WHAT AND HOW GOOD A YEAR. BUT I THINK THAT THE PATH TO THE HOUSE DEMOCRAT MAJORITY HAS TO INVOLVE CALIFORNIA. IF THEY ARE LOSING ONE OR TWO SEATS THERE, THAT IS ONE OR TWO SEATS NOT GOING TOWARD THE TOTAL THEY NEED. IT COULD BE A BIG PROBLEM. Dana: GETTING BACK TO THE TOPIC OF THE DAY. DRUG PRICES. HOW BIG OF A DEAL IS THAT FOR THE CONSTITUENTS AND WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING FOR, IF THE PRESIDENT OR THE DEMOCRATS? SURE. LOOK, DRUG PRICES ARE ALWAYS AN ISSUE ESPECIALLY IN MIDTERM ELECTION THAT IS USUALLY OLDER ELECTORATE. PEOPLE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN DRUG PRICES AND PAYING FOR FOOD UNFORTUNATELY. IT'S ALWAYS AN ISSUE. I THINK THEY WANT REAL SOLUTIONS. THERE IS NO SILVER BULLET HERE. THIS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS. I THINK THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE SUSPICIOUS OF ANYBODY THAT SAYS I HAVE THE MAGIC KEY. IT HAS TO BE A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH. Dana: COULD IT BE PRESIDENT TRUMP BECAUSE HE DOESN'T COME WITH THE USUAL WASHINGTON, D.C. BAGGAGE AROUND THE ISSUE COULD BLOW IT UP AND START OVER? SEEING HIM IN THE ROSE GARDEN TODAY SHOWS HE IS MAKING A SERIOUS ISSUE AND HE DOESN'T COME FROM A PARTICULARLY CONFINED SET OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES. MAYBE IT WILL GIVE HIM FLEXIBILITY TO DO INTERESTING THINGS. Dana: IT'S INTERESTING. IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE POLLING ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT MOST, WHAT THE CONCERNS ARE,
