Supporters of
Nicaragua’s ruling party
rally behind their
president. The man
who once helped
overthrow a dictator,
but is now accused of
becoming a dictator himself.
Daniel Ortega first came to
power nearly 40 years ago.
He returned for a second shot
at the presidency in 2007
and quickly set out
to consolidate power.
He even got rid
of term limits.
We watched this
live broadcast
of Ortega’s speech
in the town
of Masaya, the heart of
a popular uprising that
threatens to
bring him down.
As he called
for peace and unity,
his police forces
opened fire on residents
just blocks away from me.
The people pushed back.
Residents began
erecting barricades
three months ago in
response to the state’s
violent crackdown
on protesters.
The barricades snarled
traffic and infuriated
the government.
Masaya quickly
turned into a war zone.
Guardabarranco — that’s
his nom de guerre —
used to run 
a snack food business.
In April, he stopped
working to help
defend his neighborhood.
It’s the one bastion
of resistance
that police had
failed to control.
The people of Masaya
fought police forces
for months.
But their barricades
would soon fall.
In the capital, Managua,
the opposition
movement continues,
fueled by the injustice and
terror of the crackdown.
It all started back in April.
People came out to protest
cuts to Social Security
and were confronted with
tear gas and bullets.
President Ortega later
scrapped the reforms,
but it was too late.
It was no longer just
about Social Security.
This was about democracy.
Ortega had stacked
the courts, taken
over the legislature
and rigged elections.
And the people 
had had enough.
They started to demand
that Ortega resign.
About 300 have been killed
in violent clashes
since protests began, including
several police officers
and many students.
In a defiant move,
about 200 students
occupied this
public university.
They were holed up here for
months, surviving on donated
food and medical supplies.
Jonathan López is a third-year
economics student.
The mood was quiet, but tense.
Everyone knew 
what was coming.
Police and paramilitaries
attacked the very next day.
Two students were killed
and several others injured.
The rest were trapped
through the night.
Eventually church
leaders negotiated
to end the standoff,
and the students 
were released.
We went back to Masaya
as President Ortega
stepped up attacks
on this rebel stronghold.
That morning,
Salvadora Medina’s son,
José Esteban, had been shot
in the chest by sniper fire.
She said she’d been
cooking him breakfast
when the shot rang out.
Police and paramilitaries
finally pushed through
two days later and raised
the flag of the ruling
Sandinista party in the
neighborhood plaza.
Ortega has called it
Operación Limpieza:
the cleanup operation.
It’s a nationwide strategy
to stamp out the unrest,
clear barricades and root
out resistance at any cost.
What will happen next?
No one knows.
But for the moment,
Ortega appears
to be winning the
battle over his critics,
if only by sheer firepower.
