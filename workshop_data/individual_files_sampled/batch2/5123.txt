foreign-policy joining us now former NATO supreme Allied commander now the Dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University retired four-star Navy Admiral James stavridis he is chief international security and diplomacy analyst for NBC News and MSNBC and here on set Dean of the School of International Studies at the University of Denver former US ambassador to South Korea and former Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia Christopher Hill great to have you on set mr. ambassador let's begin with you well we've we've been talking this morning about the president speech the other night and his tweets but mainly focusing on on the speech it seems that the president is backing off a previous position which is we're getting out of Syria as quickly as possible and suggested that we will stay there and have allies move in and hopefully take our place but Richard says it's a retreat from past American positions and was discouraged by the speech what was what was your takeaway well first of all I think we have a president who always thinks he can have it all and have it now so I think he wants to get out but he wants to show that he's buttressing the ban on on chemical weapons I don't think he has any concepts of limits in his life or limits in foreign policy so he wants to stay for Isis but he wants to get out for the Syrian crisis and this is someone who simply doesn't understand the Middle East and therefore says it's too complicated and we shouldn't be involved in fact we're creating an enormous problem with Shia Sunni enmity let alone the issue of Iranian encroach you mean if we get out if we get out alone the issue of Iranian encroachment in Arab lands so we have a serious problem there he has no team to deal with it he doesn't understand it therefore said he says it's not important the president has changed his position several times Admiral stavridis but he does also fall back on the line I like to keep people guessing um but what is then what is our policy on Syria yeah the biggest problem Mika is that the the people that are guessing the most are our allies friends and partners they can't figure out what's going on and frankly I'm not sure we really understand what's going on we've kind of got it backwards we're telegraphing our tactics we have the president saying here come the tomahawks new nice and smart Telegraph's the punch tactically but strategically we're very inconsistent as my good friend Chris Hill just pointed out you can't have it both ways you have to be engaged here and I think we want to defeat the Islamic state but we also have bigger strategic objectives in the Middle East simply departing the pattern and declaring mission accomplished which it certainly is not is a very foolish way forward David Ignatius we have obviously and you you've been out on the front lines we have we're not only dealing with Assad we're dealing with Putin's Russian presence there were dealing obviously with the Iranians we're dealing with with well I if we don't want to call them outright or outright enemies as some of our toughest adversaries is it I was thinking over the weekend I was trying to draw parallels between where we are in Syria right now and how vital that region is right now to the Cold War and I'm just wondering if what we are facing in Syria are a series of choices that say Truman faced in Germany and Kennedy faced in Germany from 47 through 60 to patience is never a strong suit for the United States and patience is what's required in Syria willingness to stay committed to use American power not necessarily to try to take Damascus but to work with our allies in that country to check Russian ambitions though David to stay involved because I saw conservatives and liberals asking what is the vital American interest there so the way I would put it Joe is we saw the product of destabilization of of millions of Syrians streaming out of the country heading toward Europe and the effect on European countries Europe went through a panic about about refugees and migrants it affected European elections it affected brexit all of Europe really was destabilized by a war that the United States and its allies couldn't seem to cope with so my feeling about Syria every time I go there is there is a part of the country where the US has succeeded in working with allies this is to stabilize things people are beginning to put their homes back together getting electricity working again bailing out of that as President Trump seemed to want to do two weeks ago I thought would be a really bad idea and the one shred of good policy that I'd take away from that from what just happened is I think that's less likely I think that through the course of the the bombings to enforce the norm against chemical chemical weapons the president also is understood this is not the time to be pulling troops out willy-nilly we got a got to stay the course a little log around what's in it for the American people all the things that come from a strong and reliable us as leader of the global system there's so many benefits that accrue from that but it take Europe as there's this as the centerpiece Europe really needs to know that that the United States is gonna help them keep these refugee flows down otherwise European paws is gonna is gonna be swapped not how France was crawling about its decisive role in helping the u.s. get its policy writing in in Syria that that's a small illustration of how important it is to them and Richard the United States abandoning the region saw the rise of Isis and again for people thinking that this is just limited to Syria David brings up of course the important point that even today European elections have been impacted by the Syrian refugee crisis that has altered the political landscape on the continent absolutely go to less than the last 15 years is the United States gets in trouble when either it tries to do too much in the Middle East or too little when we tried to transform the Middle East into this air region of democracy we had the Iraq war we lost the balance against Iran we exacerbated Sunni Shia ties when we tried to do too little whether under Barack Obama or Donald Trump look what fills the vacuum it's Isis it's Iran it's Russia right now you have Iran dominant in four countries from Iraq through Lebanon you you've got the possibility of an Iranian war with Israel involving Hezbollah a saudi-iranian war we our interests will not be unaffected by this so you know trying to get it right you know it's almost like a myth the really shy a middle path for the Middle East between trying to transform it and trying to get out of it that's what we need to find the president is still too close to the getting out I I think mica we've found it we have a sustainable policy right now in the Middle East there 2000 American troops we've used allies there and put Isis back on their heels they're not defeated Donald Trump thinks they're defeated they're not defeated yet well it's a complex problem here's Secretary of Defense mattis late last week talking about the Syrian refugees take a look I've seen refugees from Asia to Europe Kosovo to Africa I've never seen refugees as traumatized as coming out of Syria Wow that's dark ambassador again let's talk about Syria and what's at risk and talk about the refugee first of all there's a lot at risk but we need to be careful not to conflate the deployment of troops with having a policy we don't have a policy usually when you deploy troops you bomb something you do it in pursuit of a political objective I'm not sure what the political choice even the troops David Ignatius reports and even the troops that are in Syria right now doing such a great job pushing back on Isis don't know what their policy here are another of metastasizing wars there there's the war against Isis we're pretty clear on that and frankly we've made a lot of progress on that the issue though is the Syrian civil war and that's where we need a policy do we want Syria to stay as one country do we want do we have some notion of what kind of decentralization if we have a policy then you can consider the instruments of national security to pursue the policy other if you are not pursuing a policy what are you doing are you taking retribution against Assad maybe you are but maybe you're also creating more refugees in that process so let's have a policy Nick so Admiral are we seeing the influence yet of John Bolton in this White House he's often termed a hawk narrowly but I think his view of power is different from the presidents perhaps more expansive are we seeing his thumb prints a bit in the last couple of days I think we are although I would observe he's just warming up that's a comment for Richard Haass yeah how are those Yankees doing against the Red Sox exactly yeah cross the bow very good image for an admiral so yes we have got to as as ambassador Hill says develop a policy but John Bolton is one who is going to reach for that hard power instrument I would argue he's probably gonna reach for it against Iran I I think it would be a mistake but I think we're gonna walk away from the Iranian deal that'll open up the opportunity if you will for real conflict with Iran bad move and I think the instrument of hard power in North Korea which is kind of diminished in conversational value over the last few weeks but my sense is the fundamentals aren't good there the odds are we are going to not be able to cut a good deal and john bolton is someone who's going to push for pressure that military instrument I think ambassador Hill has it exactly right you got to dial it in between hard power in soft power there are times you need hard power we're not going to negotiate with the Islamic state but the long game has got to include the policy that diplomacy the economic piece that David Ignatius just talked about when you dial those two in you have your best hope of resolving a situation like Syria all right Admiral James stavridis thank you so much ambassador Christopher Hill thank you as well thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and
