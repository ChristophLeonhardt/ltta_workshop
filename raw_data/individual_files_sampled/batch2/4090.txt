winter Tom winters outside of the courtroom Tom what happened so Katie in court that both sides were arguing back and forth about the clients that Michael Cohen has and so already this morning he disclosed that President Trump is a client of his of course we know that we also know that this morning he disclosed that Elliott Brody was a client of his that was in court filings but the third person wasn't disclosed in the court the judge judge Kimbell would push back hard on Michael Cohen's team to disclose the name he wanted to do an under seal that was denied she ordered him to disclose the name in court and that person's name is Sean Hannity so Sean Hannity has been identified as a client of Michael Cohen in the last two years this is important this is just for clients of his from 2017 and 2018 this current year Sean Hannity has been identified as a is a client how do we know this is Sean Hannity who is a anchor person at Fox News vs. Sean Hannity that just works down the street before this Michael Cohen's defense attorney said that he was a prominent person he desired that he not be named but he was a well-known public figure so I think at this point we know it's fair to assume that Sean Hannity is Michael Cohen Stern do we know what exactly Sean Hannity needed Michael Cohen's representation for so KD that information hasn't been disclosed in court they're still going back and forth is to what documents the government may be able to review whether or not there's going to be a special master whether or not there's going to be a privilege team all highly technical arguments but we haven't heard yet what exactly mr. hannity may have used mr. Cohen's legal services for so no that hasn't come up yet in court hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
