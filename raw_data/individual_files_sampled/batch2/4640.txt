thanks to at home for joining us this hour happy Tuesday all right it was September 3rd 2015 which is right before the Labor Day weekend that year politically speaking at that moment Donald Trump was a real problem for the Republican Party or at least he was a real worry for them like lots of other Republican household names Donald Trump was running for the Republican nomination for president by that point and by that point September 2015 nobody in Republican politics actually thought he could win their party's presidential nomination but by that time already it was clear that he had enough support that if he wanted to he could potentially really screw things up for the Republican Party the party was worried that if and when Donald Trump lost the Republican primary he didn't get the nomination of the party for president they were worried he might still keep running anyway he might become a spoiler the conventional wisdom in Republican politics at that time September 2015 was that even if Trump couldn't win the nomination or the presidency his stint as a candidate for president thus far was going well enough that it was really good for his celebrity status it was probably good for his business and so he would keep going with his candidacy regardless so Republicans are really worried about this worst-case scenario where Trump would not win the Republican primary but he'd stay in the race and he'd run as a third party or an independent candidate and from that position he could also definitely never win the presidency but he might siphon off enough Republican votes to really screw up the general election chances for whoever did eventually become the Republican nominee that was the worry that was what was going on in that moment in Republican electoral conventional wisdom now looking back on it from this distance it's a good big-picture reminder of how spectacularly wrong political common wisdom can be at any one moment every aspect of that was wrong but at the time September 2015 heading into that long holiday weekend that's where the Republican Party was at and over the course of a few weeks as this this this worry was really starting to solidify Republicans have decided that the way their party was going to solve this problem was with a loyalty pledge do you Republican candidates for president have any objection to signing a pledge that you will support and campaign for whoever gets the Republican nomination this year even if it is not you any of you have any objections to that yes for a long time even as all the other candidates for saying no no no they had no objections of signing the pledge there was one guy saying yes he would go along he'd said that he wouldn't go along with the Republican Party in making this this promise Trump Trump held out when all the rest of them said they'd signed the pledge and that was a cause of great consternation great gnashing of teeth in Republican politics in the late summer Trump was holding out he was refusing to take the pledge that left open the possibility that he would run as a spoiler third party candidate that would be terrible for the Republican Party but then September 3rd 2015 it all gets resolved the Trump campaign summons everybody to Trump Tower in New York to the atrium lobby of Trump Tower and they say it's going to be a big exciting announcement Donald Trump would in fact sign that pledge the best way for the Republicans to win is if I win the nomination and go directly against whoever they happen to put up and for that reason I have signed the pledge I have signed the pledge so this was this this big celebratory moment for candidate Trump and for the Republican Party all right for the party it's a load off their mind because they won't face an independent spoiler candidacy from Trump when he inevitably loses the primary for Trump it clearly relishes being in the driver's seat like that getting all this attention for this big decision and having the crowd turnout and hyping all the excitement of the moment he turned it into this big Trump Tower event but it was weird at the end of that event in amid all the excitement of this big hyped moment Trump decided to do something sort of inexplicable just something that struck everybody is a little weird thank you everybody thank you thank you Hey ladies and gentlemen this is a very an amazing man he is as you know right right Speaker of the House of Indonesia he's here to see me set you know vought know one of the most powerful men and a great man and his whole group is here to see me today and we will do great things for the United States is that correct do they like me in Indonesia Speaker of the House in Indonesia thank you very much do they like me in Division II guess I like you I as you know everybody this of course is sort of a weird moment the thing was over he says goodbye to everybody who walks away and everybody starts to you know break down and well the reporters they're gonna go like report to camera about what's going on and then he starts the whole event again this weird tacked on coda to the signing the loyalty pledge event it was just a strange moment in the moment it did solve the mystery of who that guy was who looked a little confused to be in the middle of the big loyalty pledge announcement he was standing right behind Trump while Trump was doing this thing and holding up the pledge there's probably made no sense for somebody who hadn't been following every twist and turn in the Republican presidential primary this year but it turns out that guy standing behind Trump looking confused while he made that announcement was the Indonesian Speaker of the House just an unusual cameo for that man in the middle of our presidential politics now we have talked about that weird moment a couple of times on the show before because it was so strange from what we can figure out we think the reason the Indonesian Speaker the house was there in Trump Tower that day is is because of a business meeting we think the Indonesian House Speaker was there not to talk to Trump about running for president we think he was there to talk to him about Donald Trump business interests in Indonesia well today that same man from that weird cameo in the Republican presidential primary former Indonesian Speaker the house such an Avant Oh today he was sentenced to 15 years in prison in the biggest corruption bust in modern Indonesian history boat Novato was convicted of masterminding the theft of more than a hundred and seventy million dollars from a national identity card program the new york times calling this today one of the most high-profile convictions in the history of this graft plague nation the conviction and this expected fifteen year prison term represents the downfall of one of Indonesia's most powerful men and the climax of a long public corruption saga involving this particular guy as The Times puts it today set you had been quote implicated in a number of corruption scandals over the years but he had seemed untouchable he had seemed untouchable past tense now he's been touched now he's going to the pokey for 15 years so that groundbreaking prison sentence today is important for Indonesia also turns out to be a nice sort of coda to the coda of that moment a sort of sort of final epilogue for what was that all about I mean in that moment if we know if we'd all had better foresight at the time we might have recognized that that moment was such a novotna would be a tone setting moment for the Trump administration right for a recurring problem in the Trump presidency I mean if you think about what Trump was doing there in that what was Trump doing in that moment in the Trump Tower Lobby right he was doing something weird he's an event was stopped and over and he restarted it to do this thing restarting it to brag about the powerful nature of this man who had come to see him on a business matter but he also sort of randomly and without need to he went out of his way to give his own Donald Trump public endorsement to this man in front of the assembled national press corps I mean it seems clear from the way he handled that moment he didn't even know the guys name you can see him reading the guy's name off a notecard when he makes this announcement even reading it off the note card he still gets the guy's name wrong I mean in such a circumstance why would you call that person a great man as he did said this is a great man why would you give that kind of endorsement when you don't even know the guys name well enough to read it correctly off a piece of paper why make that sort of public endorsement when you apparently really have no idea about even the very basic background of this famously corrupt person who's standing beside you but that was Trump as a candidate and now we've got Trump as president which brought us National Security Adviser Mike Flynn who was the subject of an FBI investigation led by a veteran counterespionage prosecutor even before he started lying to the FBI his second day on the job at the White House so that did not work out with Mike Flynn he was not the only one for whom things did not work out for a while we had a nominee for Labor Secretary until it turned out that his marriage had been the subject of an Oprah Winfrey TV show episode back in the day about white collar wife beaters so that one didn't work out we got a head of the Centers for Disease Control who turned out to be buying and trading tobacco stocks while running the Centers for Disease Control so yeah that one that one didn't end up working out either I mean remember for a hot minute we had a nominee for army secretary who it turned out had quite recently punched a guy out at a high-end horse auction and that was a very unusual reason for that one not working out but I mean there's been a lot of them that just didn't work out nobody asked about the background stuff I mean those ones those are just off the top of my head but this has been a dominant pattern in the effort by President Trump to staff up the federal government and his administration a lot of folks have really not worked out in the end because Trump gave his endorsement made the pic said yeah go for it I want you you're the nominee without him apparently knowing anything about the basic background of the people that he was choosing it's happened again and again and again it's still happening in today's news it means yet more about Scott Pruett at the EPA whose epic scandals are now like a never-ending gross chocolate fountain of muck the most dramatic headlines on this story today though are about Ronnie Jackson a Washington Post was first to report last night that when White House physician Ronnie Jackson was named by President Trump as his nominee to lead the Veterans Administration the White House did no vetting of Ronnie Jackson pursuant to that decision as Washington Post reporter Lisa Ryan told us on the air last night Jackson never even interviewed for the job but they nominated him anyway the New York Times today can firms that saying quote the White House did little or no vetting of Jackson's background before announcing his nomination on Twitter Trump chose dr. Jackson largely out of personal affinity now personal affinity is not nothing personal affinity makes the world go round I mean when it comes to being a presidential appointee the president personally liking you is undoubtedly an asset but it is not everything when Ronnie Jackson was first nominated to lead the VA there were immediate top-line concerns about him not having the relevant experience to take on a job quite like that I mean the very night that his nomination was announced I remember one longtime Republican lobbyist telling Axios calm and his response to the nomination could be summed up in two words Harriet Miers Harriet Miers was by all accounts a lovely person she was george w bush's supreme court nominee for one hot minute in 2005 because he liked her a lot that nomination collapsed very quickly in catastrophic ly when everybody realized that the president liking a person is not enough to qualify that person for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States now it remains to be seen whether or not the Harriet Miers analogy is the exact right one for Ronnie Jackson as of today it seems like his nomination to lead the VA may turn out worse than what happened to Harriet Miers at least at the end of her ordeal everybody still thought she was nice and doing okay at her current job and she went home to Texas and has had a law career and continued on and everybody's still like certain she still has a good reputation I mean that same pattern might have been true up until about 24 hours ago when it came to Ronnie Jackson but now that part of the Ronnie Jackson scenario is starting to fall apart dr. Jackson can you say anything at all about these allegations that have come out against you in the last few days now I just say that I was looking forward to the hearing tomorrow kind of disappointed that it's been postponed but I'm looking forward to getting to reschedule an answer to everybody's questions you've seen the allegations a hostile work environment Goggins about potentially drinking on the job over prescribing medications are you saying those are categorically untrue I'm saying I I'm looking forward to hearing so we can sit down and I can explain everything to everyone in the answer all the Senators questions about the allegations in other words not thanks guys I appreciate it thank you sir you're definitely not withdrawing you're going to continue this process sir dr. Ronnie Jackson's awkward interaction with reporters today obviously mostly dodging their questions he did if you listen closely though he did give one direct answer to one of their questions what sir IG report about the allegations no there was not turns out there was an IG report about the allegations which was first reported today by The Associated Press the IG report on Jackson was in 2012 the Navy medical inspector Navy medical Inspector General investigated what was basically a bad workplace environment for the medical staff who were working under Jackson's leadership at the White House now tonight I need to tell you the White House has mounted a sort of strange effort to try to save Ronnie Jackson's nomination in order to try to save his nomination tonight they have circulated positive evaluations of Jackson by both President Obama and President Trump this is evaluations of his performance as a White House doctor but they also made a weird decision about that inspector general report from 2012 first a senior White House official told news organizations including NBC News that Ronnie Jackson has never even been the subject of an inspector general review yeah he has and we know that because the AP reported it but we also know it because shortly after those remarks from a senior White House official the White House itself actually distributed the inspector general review that is about Ronnie Jackson they said it doesn't exist and then they gave it to reporters that was weird so now we've got the inspector general report and it's not good I don't know why they sent this around if they were trying to save dr. Jackson's nomination it's just gonna quote to you a little bit from this Inspector General report on him which was sent out by the White House tonight quote the medical inspector general command climate findings were based on observations obtained from both officer and enlisted focus groups and 14 interviews of Staff members conducted over a two day period inspector general climate finding one lack of trust in leadership trust in the organization is noted to be between two and three on a scale of one to ten there is a severe and pervasive lack of trust in the leadership that has deteriorated to the point where staff walk on eggshells the lack of trust is largely attributed to the open division between captain Kuhlman and captain Jackson Ronnie Jackson was Captain Jackson at that point now he's one-star Rear Admiral Ronnie Jackson quote about both captain Coleman and captain Jackson complain about the other two subordinates and seek alliances from them the inspector general described an opinion among White House medical unit staff that quote captain Jackson undermines captain Coleman because he desires to be the physician to the President and he's less concerned about effectively leading the White House medical unit that's finding one finding to command climate overall unit morale on a scale of one to ten is it to quote when reviewing the most recent command Climate Survey from 2010 one member states they personally witnessed captain Coleman and captain Jackson scrutinizing the results of the survey attempting to attribute specific comments to staff members and dismiss their concern stating quote they will be transferring soon it should be noted there were virtually no positive characterizations of the command climate during the visit members stated they strongly supported the mission were exceptionally proud to be part of such an important mission but they believed the current atmosphere was toxic and not sustainable from page four of the report quote focus group comments some specific quotes and comments from the focus groups concerning the command climate are noted quote worst command ever senior officers are not leading quote passive aggressive behavior is exhibited by leadership command climate is terrible the leaders are childlike again the leader in this case who's being reviewed alongside this other officer who he apparently could not get along with I mean Ronni Jackson and again this was given to reporters tonight by the White House as part of an effort to salvage Ronnie Jackson's nomination to lead the VA and this was an Inspector General report into how he was doing running the relatively small office of the White House medical unit I mean we know from people who have served in the White House over multiple administration's we know from these positive evaluations that were released by the White House tonight alongside this IG report that that president's and White House staff who were treated by dr. Jackson and his capacity as a physician they all liked him as a doctor should he be something other than a doctor should he run a very large complex organization with a very complex leadership environment well this is a fairly devastating report about his capacity to lead in an organization of even modest size the conclusion of this IG report from 2012 is that the White House should consider removing him from this job because of his leadership capacity and the White House didn't remove him and we know that multiple presidents have again liked him being their doctor both Obama and Trump recommended that he get Navy promotions while still serving as the White House doctor but this nomination to lead the Veterans Administration would be a very different kind of job in a very different kind of promotion the VA has a budget of 185 billion dollars billion it has 360,000 employees it treats 9 million 9 million veterans in terms of their health care it's one of the hardest jobs in government however well people like dr. Jackson as a doctor the nomination to this much larger stage has apparently brought people out of the woodwork in the military to caution against it earlier this afternoon CNN reported that two former White House medical staff had come forward both to the Senate veterans of Veterans Affairs Committee and also to CNN to allege questionable behavior by Admiral Jackson at the White House quote including excessive drinking and a toxic work environment under his leadership we've seen the vague outlines of these allegations over the past 24 hours and now we've got inexplicably this IG report released by the White House which very unfavorable to Ronnie Jackson so we've been we've seen some of these allegations we've started to get some flesh on the bones as to what the problem is with Jackson's nomination specifically but then tonight on NPR the top Democrat on the Veterans Committee Senate senator Jon Tester finally agreed to spell it all out to lay it all out in a long and frankly jaw-dropping interview did you hear this tonight hold on we've got that coming up stay with us hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
