THE WALL. KRISTEN, THANK YOU. FROM OUR CRITICS ARE CALLING LAZY JOURNALISM AT "THE NEW YORKER" OVER A JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH’S LATEST ATTORNEY TO THE MIXED MESSAGES OVER DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN, ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN, FOX NEWS MEDIA ANALYST HOWARD KURTZ IS HERE TO EXAMINE TODAY’S ROLLER COASTER COVERAGE. TODAY’S FRENZY OF A ROD ROSENSTEIN, WHICH MEANT WALL-TO-WALL AND CABLE NEWS, WAS WALL-TO-WALL AND CABLE NEWS, WAS NOT JOURNALISM’S FINEST HOUR. SOURCES TELL CNN THAT ROSENSTEIN HAS SUBMITTED HIS RESIGNATION. THAT WAS NOT THE CASE. AXIOS HAD ALSO REPORTED TO THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL HAD VERBALLY RESIGNED, ONLY LATER POSTING A CLARIFICATION THAT HE HAD OFFERED TO RESIGN TO WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF JOHN KELLY AND IT WASN’T CLEAR IF THAT OFFER HAD BEEN ACCEPTED. NUMEROUS OUTLETS INCLUDING FOX NEWS QUOTED SOURCES SAYING ROSENSTEIN EXPECTED TO BE FIRED. ROSENSTEIN EXPECTED TO BE FIRED. THIS IN THE WAKE OF A "NEW YORK TIMES" REPORT DENIED BY ROSENSTEIN THAT LAST YEAR HE HAD SPOKEN SERIOUSLY OF SECRETLY HAD SPOKEN SERIOUSLY OF SECRETLY TAPING PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PURSUING THE 25TH AMENDMENT. THEN CAME HOURS OF MEDIA CHATTER THEN CAME HOURS OF MEDIA CHATTER AND SPECULATION AS EVERYONE WAITED FOR ROSENSTEIN TO VISIT THE WHITE HOUSE. I’M CONFUSED WHY THEY’RE SO MUCH CONFUSION. I WISH I COULD HELP WITH YOUR I WISH I COULD HELP WITH YOUR CONFUSION BUT I, TOO, I’M CONFUSED. AFTER WHICH THE ONLY NEWS WAS AFTER WHICH THE ONLY NEWS WAS THAT HE HAD A PHONE CALL THE PRESIDENT AND THEY WOULD MEET THURSDAY. THE MEDIA POUNCING ON A "NEW YORKER" REPORT BY A PULITZER PRIZE WINNER RONAN FARROW ABOUT A SECOND ROOM AND MAKING ACCUSATIONS AGAINST BRETT MAKING ACCUSATIONS AGAINST BRETT KAVANAUGH ALTHOUGH THE STORY HAD KAVANAUGH ALTHOUGH THE STORY HAD SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS. THE ACCUSER, DEBORAH ROMERO’S, SAYS IT KAVANAUGH EXPOSED HIMSELF TO HER AT A PARTY AT EL IN THE EARLY 1980s, WHICH HE CALLS A SMEAR PARENT SIMPLE. BUT THE PIECE CONTAINED THOSE FLASHING RED LIGHT. RAMIREZ WAS HESITANT TO SPEAK PUBLICLY IN PART BECAUSE HER MEMORIES CONTAINED GAPS BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN DRINKING AT THE TIME OF THE ALLEGED INCIDENT. ONLY AFTER SIX DAYS OF CAREFULLY ONLY AFTER SIX DAYS OF CAREFULLY ASSESSING HER MEMORIES AND CONSULTING WITH HER ATTORNEY DID CONSULTING WITH HER ATTORNEY DID RAMIREZ FEEL CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO RAMIREZ FEEL CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO MAKE THE CHARGE. WE SAY THAT IS EXTREMELY TYPICAL OF THESE STORIES, WHEN YOU ARE DEALING WITH TRAUMA, ALCOHOL. DOES THE STORY APPEAR PARTISAN? WHY DID YOU COME FORWARD? SHE CAME FORWARD BECAUSE SENATE DEMOCRATS BEGAN LOOKING AT THIS CLAIM. "THE NEW YORKER" DID NOT FIND "THE NEW YORKER" DID NOT FIND A SINGLE EYE WITNESS, ONLY ONE PERSON WHO CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN TOLD BY SOMEONE ELSE. "THE NEW YORK TIMES" FROM A STORY UNFAIR TO PRINT, SAYING IT STORY UNFAIR TO PRINT, SAYING IT HAD INTERVIEWED SEVERAL DOZEN PEOPLE AND COULD FIND NO ONE WITH FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE. RAMIREZ HERSELF CONTACTED FORMER RAMIREZ HERSELF CONTACTED FORMER GAIL CLASSMATES AND SAID SHE COULD NOT BE CERTAIN THAT KAVANAUGH WAS THE ONE WHO EXPOSED HIMSELF. FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH, AND IT GIVES HORRID TROUBLE REMEMBERING GIVES HORRID TROUBLE REMEMBERING HER STORY. ROD ROSENSTEIN, NO FIRING, NO
