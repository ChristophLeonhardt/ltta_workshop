>>> THIS IS AN ABC NEWS SPECIAL 
REPORT.
NOW REPORTING, GEORGE 
STEPHANOPOULOS.
>> GOOD AFTERNOON.
WE'RE COMING ON THE AIR BECAUSE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS IN THE EAST 
ROOM OF THE WHITE HOUSE WITH THE
PRIME MINISTER OF NORWAY.
ERNA SOLBERG ABOUT TO HOLD A 
PRESS CONFERENCE, ABOUT TO TAKE 
QUESTIONS IN THE EAST ROOM, IN 
HIS FIRST FULL WEEK OF THE NEW 
YEAR.
AND I WANT TO GO TO OUR SENIOR 
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, 
CECELIA VEGA AS WE WAIT FOR 
PRIME MINISTER SOLBERG TO FINISH
HER REMARKS.
A NEW TACK OF OPENNESS, ALLOWING
THE PRESS IN FOR 45 MINUTES AT 
THE BIPARTISAN CONGRESSIONAL 
MEETING ON IMMIGRATION YESTERDAY
WITH HIS CABINET.
TODAY, ALSO BASKING IN THE 
PRAISE HE GOT FOR THAT AND NOW 
TAKING QUESTIONS AT THIS PRESS 
CONFERENCE.
>> LAVISHING SOME OF THE PRAISE 
ON HIMSELF, TOO, GEORGE.
THAT CABINET MEETING YESTERDAY 
WAS ABSOLUTELY ASTOUNDING.
OUR CAMERAS ALLOWED IN THE ROOM 
FOR ESSENTIALLY THE FULL LENGTH 
OF THIS DISCUSSION, I SHOULD 
SAY, NOT A CABINET MEETING, BUT 
THIS MEETING WITH DEMOCRATIC AND
REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS, A 
BIPARTISAN MEETING AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE TO TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION.
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" HAD THE 
BEST LINE, THEY CALLED IT A MIX 
BETWEEN THE WEST WING AND THE 
APPRENTICE.
THAT'S WHAT WE SAW.
CAMERAS WERE ROLLING AS THIS 
DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW TO DEAL 
WITH IMMIGRATION REFORM IN THIS 
COUNTRY WAS HAPPENING.
OF COURSE, ALL OF THAT WAS 
ALLOWED TO HAPPEN IN THE WAKE OF
THIS BOOK THAT HAS THIS WHITE 
HOUSE IN TURMOIL.
THAT "FIRE AND FURY" THE 
BOMBSHELL BEHIND THE SCENES LOOK
AT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE 
WHITE HOUSE, AND THE BIGGEST 
ALLEGATION, AS YOU KNOW, 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S 
MENTAL FITNESS.
I WONDER IF THE QUESTIONS WILL 
COME UP TODAY.
>> A QUESTION COMING IN RIGHT 
NOW.
>> WASHINGTON EXAMINER.
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
YESTERDAY, IN A MEETING WITH 
LAWMAKERS, YOU SAID YOU WOULD BE
OPEN TO SIGNING JUST ABOUT ANY 
IMMIGRATION DEAL THAT THAT 
BIPARTISAN GROUP OF LAWMAKERS 
SENT TO YOU.
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO SIGN AN 
IMMIGRATION DEAL THAT ULTIMATELY
DOES NOT INCLUDE FUNDING FOR THE
BORDER WALL OR WOULD THAT BE A 
RED LINE FOR YOU?
>> NO, NO.
NO.
GOT TO INCLUDE THE WALL.
WE NEED THE WALL FOR SECURITY.
WE NEED THE WALL FOR SAFETY.
WE NEED THE WALL FOR STOPPING 
THE DRUGS FROM POURING IN.
I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THE PEOPLE 
IN THE ROOM, BOTH DEMOCRAT AND 
REPUBLICAN, I REALLY BELIEVE 
THEY'RE GOING TO COME UP WITH A 
SOLUTION TO THE DACA PROBLEM, 
WHICH HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A 
LONG TIME.
AND MAYBE BEYOND THAT, 
IMMIGRATION AS A WHOLE.
BUT ANY SOLUTION HAS TO INCLUDE 
THE WALL BECAUSE WITHOUT THE 
WALL, IT ALL DOESN'T WORK.
YOU COULD LOOK AT OTHER 
INSTANCES, LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED
IN ISRAEL.
THEY PUT UP THE WALL, THEY SAY 
IT SOLVED A MAJOR PROBLEM.
WE NEED THE WALL.
WE HAVE TO HAVE THE WALL FOR 
SECURITY PURPOSES.
SECURITY IS NUMBER ONE.
AND SO THE ANSWER IS HAVE TO 
HAVE THE WALL.
THANK YOU.
AND PLEASE.
>> CAN I CALL ON THE NORWEGIAN 
BROADCASTING?
>> MR. PRESIDENT, PRIME 
MINISTER, RECENTLY, AN AMERICAN 
GENERAL, ROBERT NELLER, TOLD HIS
MARINES BASED IN NORWAY THERE'S 
A WAR COMING.
A BIG FIGHT.
MR. PRESIDENT, HOW IMMINENT IS 
THAT BIG WAR?
AND WHERE WILL IT TAKE PLACE?
>> WHEN YOU SAY THE BIG WAR, 
YOU'RE SAYING WHAT?
SAY IT?
>> IT WAS AN AMERICAN GENERAL, 
ROBERT NELLER.
HE VISITED THE NORWEGIAN --
>> RIGHT.
>> THE AMERICAN MARINES BASED IN
NORWAY.
HE SAID THERE IS A WAR COMING, A
BIG ASS FIGHT.
>> MAYBE HE KNOWS SOMETHING I 
DON'T KNOW.
OKAY.
I WOULD SAY THIS.
>> THERE IS NO WAR COMING?
>> WE HAVE A VERY POWERFUL 
MILITARY.
WE'RE GETTING MORE POWERFUL BY 
THE MONTH, BY THE DAY.
WE'RE ORDERING A LOT OF 
EQUIPMENT, YOU'RE ORDERING, 
WE'RE ORDERING IT IN LARGER 
AMOUNTS TO PUT IT UP MILDLY.
WE'RE BUILDING UP OUR MILITARY 
TO A POINT WE HAVE NEVER BEEN 
BEFORE.
WE'RE VERY MUCH WEAKENED OVER 
THE LAST LONG PERIOD OF TIME.
BUT NOT WITH ME.
NO, I DON'T EXPECT THAT.
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE -- 
BECAUSE OF STRENGTH, PEACE 
THROUGH STRENGTH.
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A 
LONG PERIOD OF PEACE.
I HOPE WE DO.
WE HAVE CERTAINLY PROBLEMS WITH 
NORTH KOREA, BUT A LOT OF GOOD 
TALKS ARE GOING ON RIGHT NOW.
A LOT OF GOOD ENERGY.
I SEE A LOT OF GOOD ENERGY.
I LIKE IT VERY MUCH, WHAT I'M 
SEEING.
I SPOKE THIS MORNING WITH, AS 
YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT.
PRESIDENT MOON, OF SOUTH KOREA.
HE HAD SOME REALLY GREAT 
MEETINGS.
HIS REPRESENTATIVES HAD A GREAT,
GREAT MEETING.
AND I HAD SOME VERY GOOD 
FEEDBACK FROM THAT.
HOPEFULLY, A LOT OF GOOD THINGS 
ARE GOING TO WORK OUT.
I THINK THAT WE WILL HAVE PEACE 
THROUGH STRENGTH.
OUR MILITARY WILL BE STRONGER 
THAN IT EVER WAS IN A VERY SHORT
PERIOD OF TIME, AND THAT'S MY 
OPINION.
THAT'S NOT THE GENERAL'S 
OPINION.
BUT I THINK MY OPINION COUNTS 
MORE RIGHT NOW.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYBE I COULD JUST ADD THAT 
THE REASON WHY WE ARE SO HAPPY 
WE HAVE YOU AS MARINES TRAINING 
IN NORWAY IS THAT'S PART OF THE 
DETERRENCE STRATEGY TO MAKE SURE
WE DON'T HAVE A WAR IN THE 
FUTURE.
>> YES, SARAH, DID YOU HAVE A 
QUESTION?
DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE 
PRIME MINISTER.
>> I DID, YES.
THANK YOU.
MADAM PRIME MINISTER.
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID THE 
INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIAN 
COLLUSION MAKES OUR COUNTRY, 
QUOTE, LOOK VERY BAD.
AND HE SAID THIS MORNING THAT, 
QUOTE, THE WORLD IS LAUGHING AT 
OUR STUPIDITY.
SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS, ARE 
YOU LAUGHING AT THE RUSSIAN 
INVESTIGATION?
>> I THINK -- I THINK THAT IT'S 
UP TO EVERY POLITICAL SYSTEM AND
COUNTRY TO SCRUTINIZE AND 
DISCUSS THEIR OWN POLITICAL 
AGENDA IN THEIR COUNTRIES.
I RESPECT THAT VERY MUCH.
AND THIS IS AN ISSUE FOR 
AMERICAN POLITICS.
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY IT HAS 
IMPACTED ALSO IN EUROPE.
I THINK ALL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES 
WHO HAVE HAD ELECTIONS THIS YEAR
HAVE BEEN LOOKING INTO WILL 
THERE BE ANY TYPE OF TAMPERING.
WE CONCLUDED AFTEROUR ELECTION 
WE COULD NOT FIND ANY PROOF OF 
ANY TRYING TO PUT AN EMPHASIS ON
THAT FROM COUNTRIES OUTSIDE 
NORWAY.
I THINK IT WAS VERY NORWEGIAN 
ELECTION WITH NORWEGIAN 
PARTICIPANTS.
>> I WILL SAY THIS.
THERE IS COLLUSION.
BUT IT'S REALLY WITH THE 
DEMOCRATS AND THE RUSSIANS.
FAR MORE THAN IT IS WITH THE 
REPUBLICANS AND THE RUSSIANS.
SO THE WITCH HUNT CONTINUES.
JOHN, GO AHEAD.
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
I ALSO HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE 
PRIME MINISTER, BUT IF I COULD 
ADDRESS THE PRESIDENT FIRST.
SARAH BROUGHT UP THE RUSSIAN 
INVESTIGATION.
YOUR LEGAL TEAM, SOURCES HAVE 
TOLD US, BELIEVES THAT IN THE 
NEXT FEW WEEKS, THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL, ROBERT MUELLER, WILL 
ASK FOR SOME SORT OF INTERVIEW 
WITH YOU.
YOUR LEGAL TEAM BELIEVES AS PART
OF WRAPPING UP HIS 
INVESTIGATION.
ARE YOU OPEN TO MEETING WITH 
HIM?
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO MEET 
WITH HIM WITHOUT CONDITION OR 
WOULD YOU DEMAND THAT A STRICT 
SET OF PARAMETERS BE PLACED 
AROUND ANY ENCOUNTER BETWEEN YOU
AND THE SPECIAL COUNSEL?
>> AGAIN, JOHN, THERE HAS BEEN 
NO COLLUSION BETWEEN THE TRUMP 
CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIANS OR TRUMP 
AND RUSSIANS.
NO COLLUSION.
WHEN I WATCH YOU INTERVIEWING 
ALL THE PEOPLE LEAVING THEIR 
COMMITTEES, I MEAN, THE 
DEMOCRATS ARE RUNNING FOR 
OFFICE, AND THEY'RE TRYING TO 
SAY THIS, BUT THE BOTTOM LINE, 
THEY ALL SAY THERE'S NO 
COLLUSION.
THERE IS NO COLLUSION.
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT INTERVIEWS, 
HILLARY CLINTON HAD AN INTERVIEW
WHERE SHE WASN'T SWORN IN.
SHE WASN'T GIVEN THE OATH.
THEY DIDN'T TAKE NOTES.
THEY DIDN'T RECORD.
AND IT WAS DONE ON THE 4th OF 
JULY WEEKEND.
THAT'S PERHAPS RIDICULOUS.
A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOKED UPON THAT
AS BEING A VERY SERIOUS BREACH 
AND IT REALLY WAS.
BUT AGAIN, I'LL SPEAK TO 
ATTORNEYS.
I CAN ONLY SAY THIS.
THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO 
COLLUSION.
EVERYBODY KNOWS IT.
EVERY COMMITTEE.
I HAVE BEEN IN OFFICE NOW FOR 11
MONTHS.
FOR 11 MONTHS, THEY HAVE HAD 
THIS PHONY CLOUD OVER THIS 
ADMINISTRATION, OVER OUR 
GOVERNMENT.
AND IT HAS HURT OUR GOVERNMENT.
IT DOES HURT OUR GOVERNMENT.
IT'S A DEMOCRAT HOAX THAT WAS 
BROUGHT UP AS AN EXCUSE FOR 
LOSING AN ELECTION THAT FRANKLY 
THE DEMOCRATS SHOULD HAVE WON 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE SUCH A 
TREMENDOUS ADVANTAGE IN THE 
ELECTORAL COLLEGE.
IT WAS BROUGHT UP FOR THAT 
REASON.
BUT IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT 
THERE IS NO COLLUSION, AND BY 
VIRTUALLY EVERYBODY.
SO WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
>> WOULD YOU BE OPEN?
>> WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
BUT WHEN THEY HAVE NO COLLUSION 
AND NOBODY HAS FOUND ANY 
COLLUSION AT ANY LEVEL, IT SEEMS
UNLIKELY THAT YOU WOULD EVEN 
HAVE AN INTERVIEW.
>> MADAM PRIME MINISTER, NORWAY 
SHARES A SMALL BUT STRATEGIC 
BORDER WITH RUSSIA.
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S POSITION HAS 
BEEN IT'S BETTER TO TRY TO WORK 
WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN IF POSSIBLE 
THAN TO WORK AGAINST HIM.
WHERE DO YOU COME DOWN ON THAT 
IDEA?
BETTER TO WORK WITH PUTIN THAN 
TO NOT WORK WITH HIM.
>> I THINK RUSSIA IS AN 
IMPORTANT PLAYER IN 
INTERNATIONAL WORLD, AND I DON'T
THINK YOU CAN NOT WORK WITH AND 
TALK TO.
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, IT'S 
IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT WE HAVE A 
LINE WITH ALL THE SANCTIONS, AS 
THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS DONE AND 
AS A MEMBER CONNECTED BY NATO 
AND INTERCONNECTED TO THAT, WE 
HAVE ALSO SUFFERED SOME ECONOMIC
DIFFICULTIES IN SOME AREAS IN 
NORWAY BASED ON THOSE SANCTIONS.
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, WE HAVE A
VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH 
RUSSIA OVER THAT BORDER AREA.
WHERE WE DO HAVE VERY MUCH FREE 
MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE.
ESPECIALLY PEOPLE MOVING TO AND 
FROM.
WE HAVE VERY LARGE CORPORATION 
ON SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES IN THIS
AREA.
THE BIGGEST COD AREA IN THE 
WORLD.
A SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE.
WE DO PATROL IT, WE DO WORK 
TOGETHER.
WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO 
TWO THINGS AT THE SAME TIME.
YES, THE INTERNATIONAL LAW IS 
CLEAR.
THERE WAS A BREAK OF THAT 
THROUGH THE ANNEXATION OF CRIMEA
AND THE SITUATION IN UKRAINE, 
AND WE DO STAND BY ALL OF OUR 
ALLIES WITH THAT.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, AS A 
NEIGHBORING COUNTRY, WE DO 
DAY-TO-DAY WORK ON THINGS WE 
HAVE TO SOLVE FOR THE PROBLEM 
AND THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY THAT 
IS IN THAT AREA.
AND WHICH IS A FRAGILE AREA FOR 
THE WHOLE WORLD.
>> JUST TO ADD TO THE ANSWER.
I THINK IT IS MUCH BETTER TO 
WORK WITH RUSSIA.
IT'S VERY MUCH BETTER HAVING TO 
DO WITH NORTH KOREA WHERE WE 
CURRENTLY HAVE A PROBLEM THAT 
SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN MY 
PROBLEM.
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM 
SOLVED MANY YEARS AGO WHEN IT 
WAS MUCH LESS DANGEROUS, BUT IT 
WAS GIVEN TO ME ALONG WITH A BIG
MESS OF OTHER THINGS.
I WILL SAY THIS.
I AM FOR MASSIVE OIL AND GAS, 
AND EVERYTHING ELSE.
AND A LOT OF ENERGY.
PUTIN CAN'T LOVE THAT.
I AM FOR THE STRONGEST MILITARY 
THAT THE UNITED STATES EVER HAD.
PUTIN CAN'T LOVE THAT.
BUT HILLARY WAS NOT FOR A STRONG
MILITARY, AND HILLARY, MY 
OPPONENT, WAS FOR WINDMILLS.
AND SHE WAS FOR OTHER TYPES OF 
ENERGY THAT DON'T HAVE THE SAME 
CAPACITIES AT THIS MOMENT, 
CERTAINLY.
SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT IT'S 
A LOT BETTER TO WORK WITH OTHER 
COUNTRIES.
WE'RE WORKING WITH CHINA ON 
NORTH KOREA.
WE'RE WORKING WITH VARIOUS OTHER
COUNTRIES, AND I THINK WE'RE 
DOING VERY WELL.
WE HAD A GREAT TALK.
AS YOU KNOW, AND AS YOU 
REPORTED, WE HAD A GREAT TALK 
THIS MORNING WITH PRESIDENT 
MOON.
AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF GOOD 
THINGS ARE HAPPENING.
WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
BUT WORKING WITH OTHER 
COUNTRIES, WHETHER IT'S RUSSIA 
OR CHINA OR INDIA OR ANY OF THE 
COUNTRIES THAT SURROUND THIS 
WORLD AND ENCOMPASS THIS WORLD, 
THAT'S A GOOD THING, JOHN.
THAT'S NOT A BAD THING.
THAT'S A VERY GOOD THING.
OKAY, GO AHEAD.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, PRIME 
MINISTER.
NORWAY STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE 
PARIS AGREEMENT AND HAS 
EXPRESSED REGRET THAT YOU HAVE 
DECIDED TO LEAVE IT.
WHAT COULD PERSUADE YOU TO 
REMAIN?
AND WHAT KIND OF COMMON GROUND 
DID YOU FIND IN YOUR TALKS TODAY
ON THIS TOPIC?
>> WELL, IT WASN'T A MAJOR 
TOPIC, I MUST TELL YOU.
WE TALKED ABOUT OTHER THINGS, 
INCLUDING MOSTLY TRADE.
BUT I WILL SAY THAT THE PARIS 
AGREEMENT AS DRAWN AND AS WE 
SIGNED WAS VERY UNFAIR TO THE 
UNITED STATES.
IT PUT GREAT PENALTIES ON US.
IT MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR US
TO DEAL IN TERMS OF BUSINESS.
IT TOOK AWAY A LOT OF OUR ASSET 
VALUES.
WE ARE A COUNTRY RICH IN GAS AND
COAL AND OIL AND LOTS OF OTHER 
THINGS, AND THERE WAS A 
TREMENDOUS PENALTY FOR USING IT.
IT HURT OUR BUSINESSES.
ACCORDING TO SOME ESTIMATES, WE 
WOULD HAVE HAD TO CLOSE 
BUSINESSES IN ORDER TO QUALIFY 
BY 2025.
WHEREAS AS AN EXAMPLE, CHINA, BY
2030, THEY DON'T KICK IN UNTIL 
2030.
RUSSIA, SOMEPLACE IN THE MID 
1990s, THAT WAS THEIR STANDARD.
THAT WAS NEVER A GOOD STANDARD 
BECAUSE THAT WAS A DIRTY 
STANDARD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.
IT TREATED THE UNITED STATES 
VERY UNFAIRLY, AND FRANKLY, IT'S
AN AGREEMENT THAT I HAVE NO 
PROBLEM WITH, BUT I HAD A 
PROBLEM WITH THE AGREEMENT THEY 
SIGNED BECAUSE AS USUAL, THEY 
MADE A BAD DEAL.
SO WE COULD CONCEIVABLY GO BACK 
IN, BUT I SAY THIS.
WE'RE VERY STRONG ON THE 
ENVIRONMENT.
I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THE 
ENVIRONMENT.
OUR EPA AND OUR EPA 
COMMISSIONERS ARE VERY, VERY 
POWERFUL IN THE SENSE THAT THEY 
WANT TO HAVE CLEAN WATER, CLEAN 
AIR, BUT WE ALSO WANT BUSINESSES
THAT CAN COMPETE.
AND THE PARIS ACCORD REALLY 
WOULD HAVE TAKEN AWAY OUR 
COMPETITIVE EDGE.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THAT 
HAPPEN.
I'M NOT GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN.
>> THERE ARE BUSINESS 
OPPORTUNITIES IN THIS, AS WE 
TALKED ABOUT DURING THIS, 
BECAUSE WE HAVE STRICT 
REGULATIONS TO REACH OUR PARIS 
TARGETS.
THAT MEANS THAT WE HAVE VERY 
STRONG POLICIES FOR 
ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDLY AND 
CLIMATE FRIENDLY TECHNOLOGIES 
WHICH IS PART OF WHY THE UNITED 
STATES NOW HAS A SURPLUS IN THE 
ECONOMY TOWARDS NORWAY, SO YOU 
NEVER MESS UP ON A GOOD 
OPPORTUNITY WITH GOOD 
ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS.
>> ONE OF THE GREAT ASSETS OF 
NORWAY IS A THING CALLED WATER.
THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS HYDROPOWER.
TREMENDOUS.
IN FACT, MOST OF YOUR ENERGY AND
YOUR ELECTRICITY IS PRODUCED BY 
HYDRO.
I WISH WE WOULD DO SOME OF THAT,
BUT IT'S FANTASTIC AND A GREAT 
ASSET YOU HAVE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
GREAT HONOR.
THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, IS THE SPECIAL
COUNSEL STILL DETERMINING 
WHETHER THERE WAS COLLUSION?
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP WALKING OUT 
OF THE EAST ROOM WITH THE PRIME 
MINISTER OF NORWAY.
ONE FINAL QUESTION ON RUSSIA 
WHICH WAS A TOPIC THAT CAME UP 
SEVERAL TIMES IN A RELATIVELY 
SHORT PRESS CONFERENCE.
YOU SEE MIKE PENCE AS WELL.
THE PRESIDENT REPEATING WHAT WE 
HAVE HEARD IN THE PAST, THAT THE
RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION WAS A 
WITCH HUNT AND THERE'S BEEN NO 
COLLUSION BETWEEN THE TRUMP 
CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA.
HE SAID THE ONLY COLLUSION WAS 
DEMOCRATIC COLLUSION, OF COURSE,
SINCE MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION, 
WE HAVE LEARNED OF SOMETHING 
LIKE 30 CONTACTS BETWEEN THE 
TRUMP CAMPAIGN, TRUMP ASSOCIATES
AND THE RUSSIANS.
THAT INVESTIGATION CONTINUES, 
BOTH THE SPECIAL COUNSEL AND ON 
CAPITOL HILL.
THE PRESIDENT ALSO GOT A 
QUESTION FROM JOHN ROBERTS OF 
FOX ON WHETHER OR NOT HE WOULD 
BE WILLING TO SIT DOWN WITH 
MUELLER AND HIS ATTORNEYS IF AN 
INTERVIEW IS REQUESTED.
LAST YEAR, YOU ASKED THE 
PRESIDENT A QUESTION.
HE SAID 100% YES.
THAT'S NOT THE ANSWER WE GOT 
TODAY.
>> NO, QUITE A DIFFERENT 
QUESTION.
THE PRESIDENT SAID THERE HAS 
BEEN NO EVIDENCE OF KOO 
COLLUSION, THEREFORE, QUOTE, IT 
IS UNLIKELY YOU WOULD NEED AN 
INTERVIEW.
SO THAT SEEMED TO BE QUITE 
CLEARLY BACKING AWAY FROM THE 
OFFER.
BACK IN JUNE WHEN I ASKED HIM 
THAT QUESTION, HE SEEMED NOT 
ONLY WILLING TO TALK TO MUELLER 
BUT EAGER TO GIVE THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL HIS VERSION OF EVENTS.
HE WAS ASKED THE QUESTION, A 
VARIATION OF THE QUESTION AGAIN 
OVER THE WEEKEND AT CAMP DAVID, 
AND HE SAID, QUITE SIMPLY, YEAH,
WHEN ASKED WOULD HE BE WILLING 
TO DO AN INTERVIEW WITH MUELLER 
NOW.
HE DIDN'T QUITE SAY HE WAS 
UNWILLING TO DO IT, BUT SUCH AN 
INTERVIEW WOULD NOT BE 
NECESSARY.
>> OKAY.
AND I WANT TO GO TO OUR SENIOR 
CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT, 
MARY BRUCE.
IMMIGRATION, ANOTHER TOPIC THE 
PRESIDENT GOT A QUESTION ON.
THE FIRST QUESTION, WHETHER OR 
NOT HE WAS STILL FOR A BORDER 
WALL AND ANY DEAL THAT WOULD 
ALSO LEAD TO PROTECTIONS FOR 
THOSE D.R.E.A.M.ers.
800,000 YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WERE 
BROUGHT HERE AS CHILDREN BY 
UNDOCUMENTED PARENTS.
THE PRESIDENT TODAY SAID A WALL 
IS ESSENTIAL.
YESTERDAY AT THAT BIPARTISAN 
MEETING, HE DIDN'T INSIST ON THE
WALL.
HE TALKED ABOUT BOARDER 
SECURITY.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ON CAPITOL 
HILL.
>> THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION.
THE PRESIDENT, EVEN THOUGH HE 
SEEMS TO BE SENDING MIXED 
MESSAGES SO MUCH COMES DOWN TO 
HOW YOU ACTUALLY DEFINE THE 
WALL.
LAWMAKERS UP HERE BELIEVE IT'S 
NOT AN ACTUAL PHYSICAL WALL AS 
THE PRESIDENT ADMITTED OR SEEMED
TO CONCEDE YESTERDAY, THAT HE 
WASN'T ASKING FOR FUNDING RIGHT 
NOW TO BUILD A 2,000-MILE-LONG 
WALL.
THIS MAY BE MORE OF A FENCE, A 
BOOST IN BORDER SECURITY.
LAWMAKERS ARE STILL HUDDLING 
HERE AT THE CAPITOL, TRYING TO 
HAMMER OUT AN IMMIGRATION DEAL, 
A DEAL TO PROTECT D.R.E.A.M.ers 
AND ALSO POSSIBLY BOOST THAT 
BROADER BORDER SECURITY THAT THE
WHITE HOUSE MAY BE LOOKING FOR 
HERE.
AND I'M TOLD, I WAS JUST TALKING
WITH LAWMAKERS IN THESE MEETINGS
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE.
THEY INSIST THEY ARE GETTING 
CLOSE.
THEY ARE MAKING PROGRESS.
THAT YOU COULD SEE A DEAL HERE 
SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.
PERHAPS EVEN BY THE END OF THE 
MONTH.
>> THAT DEAL, MARY, NOT REALLY 
TALKING ABOUT A PHYSICAL WALL.
THEY'RE GOING TO PASS SOME 
BEEFED UP BORDER SECURITY AND 
BASICALLY LEAVE IT UP TO THE 
PRESIDENT ON WHETHER HE'S GOING 
TO CALL THAT A WALL.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THIS ALL WILL COME DOWN TO HOW 
YOU PLAY THIS.
THE SEMANTICS OF THIS.
REMEMBER, YESTERDAY, THE 
PRESIDENT IN THAT RATHER 
UNPRECEDENTED MEETING WITH 
LAWMAKERS SAID ULTIMATELY IT WAS
UP TO CONGRESS.
HE WOULD SIGN WHATEVER CONGRESS 
CAN AGREE TO.
>> CECELIA VEGA IS THERE AS WELL
OUT THERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
AND CECELIA, I WAS STRUCK AGAIN 
WHEN THE PRESIDENT GOT A 
QUESTION ABOUT RUSSIA.
HE DID PUSH BACK A LITTLE BIT ON
PUTIN.
UNLIKE SOME OF HIS STATEMENTS IN
THE PAST, BUT ALSO BROUGHT UP 
THE CAMPAIGN ONE MORE TIME.
>> OH, GEORGE, THAT'S ON MY 
NOTES.
IT WAS SOMETHING I WAS GOING TO 
BRING UP TO YOU.
HERE WE ARE A YEAR IN, ALMOST A 
YEAR TO THE DATE THAT THIS 
PRESIDENT WAS SWORN IN AND HE'S 
STILL TALKING ABOUT HILLARY 
CLINTON.
THAT IS HIS GO-TO DE FACTO 
ANSWER.
IT'S BECOME REALLY A RECORD, A 
BROKEN RECORD FOR HIM, IF YOU 
WILL, ON HIS ANSWER ABOUT RUSSIA
TO ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT RUSSIA.
IT'S ONE OF THE HEADLINES OUT OF
THIS VERY SHORT PRESS 
CONFERENCE, THE FACT HE'S STILL 
HAMMERING AWAY AT HILLARY 
CLINTON.
THAT'S THE MESSAGE HE FEELS VERY
SLIGHTED.
HE DOES NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT 
RUSSIA, BUT REALLY THE HINE IS 
THIS COMPLETE REVERSAL FROM THE 
QUESTION JOHN ASKED IN JUNE.
WILL YOU SIT DOWN WITH MUELLER?
WE'LL SOOWHAT HAPPENS.
