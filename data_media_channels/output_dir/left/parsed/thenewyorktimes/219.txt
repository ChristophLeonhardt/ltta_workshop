This is Andrea Constand,
the woman whose
sexual assault complaint
against Bill Cosby
brought down the man once
known as “America’s dad.”
“Finally, we can say:
Women are believed.
And not only on #MeToo,
but in a court of law.”
She’s the only woman
among more than 50 others
whose case against Cosby
has resulted in a conviction.
“I feel like my faith
in humanity is restored.”
Constand and Cosby’s story
started more than 15 years ago
in Philadelphia.
She was 29 years old
at the time, and worked
for the women’s basketball
team at Temple University.
Cosby was the university's most
famous alum and a trustee.
They met at a
basketball game in 2002.
Constand grew up
in Toronto, Canada.
She was a star high school
basketball player
and had dreams of
playing professionally.
Over the next two years,
the pair had a
friendly relationship.
In 2004, Constand says
Cosby assaulted her
at his Pennsylvania mansion
after giving her three
pills that left her frozen.
He claims the sex
was consensual.
The pills, he later said,
were Benadryl.
Constand reported the attack
to the police a year later,
but prosecutors decided not
to charge Cosby at the time.
She later filed
a civil suit
and got a settlement
of over $3 million.
Cosby’s defense team
used that to paint her
her as a scheming
former lover.
“Andrea Constand made up
these fantastical stories
in order to get rich.”
A criminal investigation
was reopened in 2015.
“We’re here because
we want to seek the truth.”
At this point, more than
50 women had come forward
with similar accusations
of sexual misconduct.
Many of these
cases happened
outside the 12-year
statute of limitations.
So Constand became
the lone accuser
who brought
criminal charges.
The jury came to their
decision in just two days.
“We don’t think Mr. Cosby
is guilty of anything.
And the fight is not over.”
