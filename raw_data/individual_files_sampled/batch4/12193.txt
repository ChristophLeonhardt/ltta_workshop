Justin Timberlake has cut a new video the part that I find noteworthy about this is that the left is going crazy about this music video and I really don't see why so here it is it's produced by Pharrell and his wife Jessica Biel is is they're in a voiceover so here is the the trailer for his album man of the woods this album is really inspired by my son my wife my family but more so than any other album I've ever written where I'm from and it's personal Justin Timberlake loves nature man it's a rhythm it's fire we pour okay so in any case and the reason that this is noteworthy is because first of all justin timberlake is from tennessee right he is from tennessee so people have freed him like you said oh look look at this look at the city boy going and acting like he likes all the nature and such okay he is from Memphis Tennessee right he grew up in Shelby Forest which is a small community between Memphis and Millington I know this because of dr. Wikipedia right is this idea that he has no connection with sort of the country is just silly but there are bunch of people who are pissed about it so there's it there's an article in a an outlet called the outline where they say Justin Timberlake is rebranding as a white man he's embracing his authentic roots rebranding is white what was he ever blacked and I missed that part because I'm pretty aware that everybody knew that he was white for like his entire life because he's white but he's a rebranding as a white man to go back to where you're from I mean he's from Memphis I just I don't understand this but again the race-baiting is so thorough here that if you are if you're a guy who wears a cowboy hat you want to talk about kind of cultural cultural discrimination if you are a white guy who wears a cowboy hat or boots in a place with a bush then all of a sudden you are considered a hick who hates black people I mean that's basically what the outline is trying to say here there's literally what they say I have to read this cuz it's insane they say the trailer for Timberlake's new album man of the woods present the former NSYNC heartthrob looking pensive in various natural settings hitting every note of the white man finding himself in the empty West trope that has long been part of America's romantic fictional past well what now like huh this is white colonialist fantasies aside there's something very familiar about this pivot and Timberlake style white colonialist fantasy he's literally standing on a rock I don't see his slaves I don't see him fighting with Native Americans right what Pocahontas is nowhere to be found but the insane race consciousness here is just beyond so that what they're saying is that Timberlake has a long history with hip-hop and R&B genre is invented and dominated by black people and to be clear without african-americans there would be no rock or country music as we know it either but I digress right so he moved from quote-unquote black culture but now he's pandering to white America um or maybe he just wants to do an album about where he's from is that possible okay what if I just like jazz I like jazz because it was invented by black people but because classic jazz is great stuff what if I like country music because I'm Jewish like I have no connection I have no real connection to any of these musics probably more to jazz and I need a country music but this this is this notion that everything has to be broken down by sort of cultural stereotype it just demonstrates the intersectional stupidity have so many people who are commentators in our culture I don't see what Justin Timberlake is doing wrong by standing in a jacket in a forest like the forests belong to us all
