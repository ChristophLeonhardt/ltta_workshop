daily wire cultural correspondent Michael Knowles wrote an excellent article this week called an actual conservatives guide to the alt-right 8 things you need to know I'm sure some of you saw it and said to yourself I would like to read that article if it didn't involve laborious Lee running my eyes back and forth over the page identifying letters and stringing them together to make words which I would then have to go through all the trouble of understanding fortunately it's for lazy ignorant unmotivated people like yourselves that we have the Andrew Clavin show so today we're going to summarize Noel's article exactly as if we had read it ourselves instead of getting distracted by a marathon rerun of the first season of Big Brother what are the 8 things you need to know about the alt-right the motley collection of lowlife racists and nazi slave minds who fooled themselves into thinking that being ironical about the fact that they're evil somehow saves them from being the moral scum they obviously are ok what are the other 7 things you need to know number two racism is the movements central premise white identity is a favorite theme of alt writers because it allows them to feel superior to other people without having to take the trouble to actually accomplish anything sure a black person might hit a home run or create a work of art but all try ters have pink colored skins so they're special because something something something number three the alt-right is anti-semitic the alt-right likes to isolate make fun of Jewish people by putting parentheses around their names so you may say well Albert Einstein explains space-time and Jonas Salk cured polio and men like Louis be mayor invented the American movie business but the alt-right would answer yes but we put parentheses around their names so that's a big accomplishment to number four the alt-right is tech savvy with roots in Silicon Valley that's good news because it means they're actually unlikely to engage in any activity that might cause them to reproduce number five the alt-right loves the matrix because it's a film produced by Jews starring a black man and written and directed by two sexually submissive men who ultimately decided they were actually women so I guess the alt right just likes that sort of number six the alt-right loves Christendom but rejects Christianity you see the European races began as a group of thuggish rapists and murderers but were slowly civilised by their worship of a globalist Jewish man the alt-right wants to keep the European races but lose the Jewish man what could go wrong number seven the alt-right practices a satirical religion called CAC in which they worship a cartoon frog because they're white people and therefore superior to people who don't worship cartoon frogs and eight the alt-right wants to burn american politics to the ground to help them The Daily wire has built a large carnival where the house people the American politics and invited the alt-right to step inside and burn it to the ground this is going to be fun trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show alright alright we're back and the clave this weekend seems to have begun early with a massive train wreck in Hoboken New Jersey over a hundred people injured which is double trouble because you're not only hurt you're in Hoboken New Jersey but I hope it can only get worse but you can stave it off by getting your copy of the great good thing my memoir the great good thing a secular Jew comes to faith in Christ you can get it for free I think you still can get it for free if you just subscribe to The Daily wire I'll be on Ben's show later on we'll be talking about it I think we're just gonna dress up in sumo diapers and just bang into each other hoping but anyway if you if you do subscribe you can watch this entire show run streaming live right this minute on the daily wire web site if not you get it for 15 minutes on Facebook and YouTube and then the gigantic curtain falls over your eyes and not only can you not see this you can't see anything for hours on end but you can come to the daily wire site and listen to it or download it like later on iTunes or SoundCloud alright so this was the week of the first debate and now as was foretold to you on the show the polls are starting to come in to show that people feel that Trump lost and he's starting to lose a little ground in the polls he was from 538 this is the Nate Silver site that does a pretty good job of kind of parsing the polls you know thinking about what they mean and what we should watch out about he says every scientific poll we've encountered so far suggests that voters thought Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump and Monday night's debate in fact some of them showed her winning by a wide margin wide enough to make it a good bet though not a guarantee that she'll gain in horse race polls against Trump over the next week or so so far we've seen just two polls released the tested Clinton standing against Trump after the debate they have pretty good news for Clinton but I'd recommend some caution until we get more data the polls have her either three points up or five points up and that's a bounce from where she was before is one or two points silver says the reason to be cost there are reasons to be cautious polls conducted over a one or two day period like the morning consult in Ashkelon polls can suffer from low response rates since the pollsters won't have time to recontact voters who they missed the first time around that could plausibly bias the poll toward whichever candidate has the most enthusiastic supporters at the time of the poll making it less represent representative another complication is that it can be hard to separate voters reaction to the debate itself from their reaction to the media's reaction to the bait and we know what the media's reaction to the bait is hears from news busters you remember at the last minute on this thing Hillary Clinton Unleashed this clearly prepared attack about Miss Universe right let's play that lets players play the cut of this is the end of the debate Hillary Clinton obviously had this in in her back pocket also had the press saddled up that she had them primed to catch up to it so here she goes this is a man who has called women pigs slobs and dogs and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers who has said women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men and one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest he loves beauty contests supporting them and hanging around them and he called this woman Miss Piggy then he called her miss housekeeping because she was latina Donald she has a name when did you fire her name machado where did you phone she has become a US citizen and you can bet a real she's going to vote that's know voce good okay Alicia Machado Miss Venezuela in 1995 went on to become Miss Universe in 1996 and then by her own testimony she said after she won all she wanted to do was eat eat and eat that is a direct quote she gained a lot of weight Trump complained about it called her names here's from our friends at News Buster's once again ABC CBS and NBC have ignored a major news story that could be embarrassing to Hillary Clinton and have national implications while promoting a negative and trivial Trump story initially pushed by the Clinton campaign on September 23rd news broke that during the now-infamous investigation into Clinton's emails the FBI granted Clinton's former chief of staff sure Mills immunity House Oversight Chairman jason Chaffetz called Mills immunity beyond explanation adding that the FBI was handing out immunity agreements like candy yet neither ABC CBS nor NBC ever even mentioned this story once this is amazing Comey we'll get back to this but Comey has been on Capitol Hill getting grilled savagely by the House by congressman the same networks that have failed to cover the mill story since it broke on September 23rd that's now six days ago were quick to devote a full 19 minutes and 40 seconds 20 minutes to the controversy over Trump allegedly calling a former Miss Universe Miss Piggy and miss housekeeping which I guess was supposed to be an attack on the fact that she's latina all right so so this is this is what Trump said at the time this is number six this is what Trump said about this is part of a Hillary Clinton ad she actually put out an ad about Alicia Machado this is what he said about her at the time she weighed 118 pounds or a hundred and seventeen pounds and she went up to 160 or 70 so this is somebody that likes to eat okay now remember this is right when Trump had taken over the contest so he's taken over the contest so he's got a business interest in this woman going around and being beautiful which she was but she got apparently overweight so now she's he's fat shaming her I always love these qualities ideas that you're not supposed to slut-shame or fat you know you don't the idea behind these these accusations is absurd because the idea is that your shame comes from me that your shame comes from my saying nasty things about no one should say nasty things about other people of course we should all be polite to one another but your shame is there anyway believe me all of us feel shame about any number of things it is a standing fact about the heat about human nature people have been trying to explain it forever I some of us like to think it's because of original sin but even the people who don't believe in original sin like Sigmund Freud had to come up with elaborate mythologies about why people feel guilty and shame and ashamed all the time and the left side eeeh that if they can just control what they say about what other people say about you that shame will go away is a lie but here is Donald Trump who is hilarious because he's just all right I mean I really dislike feminists they're rude they're mean they're one-sided they're bullies but what can you say I mean if they've got a target they you know he's got a target the size of a barn door so Donald Trump goes on Fox and Friends The Morning Show and he doubles down on this they asked him about the very last question when she brought up the person that became a you know I know that person that person was a Miss Universe person and she was the worst we ever had the worst the absolute worst issue is it possible and she was a Miss Universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as Miss Universe she was the winner and you know she gained a massive amount of weight and it was it was real problem and you know the funny thing about it is it is it is La Biche and disgusting but you can't see it from like a business man's point of view he's got this investment in this contest and now the beautiful girl has gone off and she's not as beautiful she's supposed to be so now Alicia is on TV and she is driving this home and she's doing it very very well here she is with Anderson Cooper he was really aggressive he was really rude he was a bad person with me and that is the story then I need to share with my community when you say we can't accept we can't accept more insults for my Latin community no more no more insults for the women you said that you said that he had called you and I can see the same person than I met 20 years ago all right so this is real this is really well done she's obviously been coached in what to say it's my community it's my community the Spanish people you know the entire Spanish people are now being insulted by this whole thing now there is a lot of stuff that's not being played up in American papers but it is being played up overseas in cheap tabloids like the Sun that she has a kind of spotty past shortly after she won her crown in the late 90s this is as being reported from Fox News here picking it up from the overseas pet press a judge in Venezuela accused Machado of threatening to kill him after he indicted her then-boyfriend for tempted murder Machado threatened to ruin my career as a judge and kill me judge Maximiliano fuel Meyer said at the time her boyfriend Juan Rafael Rodriguez Righetti was accused of shooting and wounding his sister's husband who he blamed for sister's suicide and she also she was also in this some kind of weird Spanish TV thing where she committed sex had sex on air and did all this stuff of course none of that really matters for what Trump did it has nothing to do with it but I'm bringing it up just so I can so ok so I was going back because of course all of us on the right look at Hillary Clinton and think this woman was the enemy of every woman who got molested by her husband molested chased raped with all these different accusations and so I wanted to go back and look at this for myself because there are a lot of things that would have now become sort of on the right they become words that just you you speak about Hillary Clinton things you say about her that may not be true for instance there's this one idea that she got fired from the Watergate committee when she was an aide on the Watergate investigative committee and she was fired and they said she was a bad personal didn't happen she was never fired off the committee there was a guy who said bad things about her but you know people can say bad things about anybody just didn't happen so I wanted to go back because there's you know obviously there's there's not a lot of proof that Hillary was conspiring against this women but I did find a lot of stuff we're gonna come back to it in a minute but first I have to say goodbye to the folks on Facebook and YouTube come on over to the Daily wire and we will continue the conversation
