this will be their safe haven end of an odyssey a key side in Valencia activists are already preparing to greet the 629 migrants due to dock this weekend our aim is to give a warm welcome to these people who have been passed around like a football Europe is trying to turn a blind eye but we want to respect their rights and offer them a home our land is their land Red Cross teams offloaded food rations and hygiene kits the migrants will get a health check and be registered by police in urgent cases especially pregnant women children will head to hospital most will go to a shelter for a square meal and a clean bed Spain's Red Cross assists thousands of undocumented migrants each year you have to understand this is a huge drama these are people who need help and we must find a solution people who are just like you and me cannot be floating around for days without knowing where they're going in these conditions they just had the bad luck to be born in a place with more complicated political or social situations Volunteers of Valencia's food bank are busy something for every hungry mouth regardless of religion or dietary requirement the charity already feeds 10,000 of the city's neediest each week and says there's plenty to go round for a few hundred more founder Jaime Sierra grew up in an orphanage himself and is passionate about helping those less fortunate people in Valencia are kind and when a stranger arrives we ask them to sit at our table and so I'd like to say welcome and that they will get our love and support you've come from afar and had a tough time but now it's time to sit down and share with us the Spanish government says those landing this weekend will be processed like all other asylum seekers no preferential treatment these migrants may still face a rocky road ahead based on last year's figures Spanish authorities are likely to grant refugee status to only one-third of the new arrivals the others could get sent right back to where they came from this may be journey's end for a lucky few but it's just another chapter in the ebb and flow of Europe's unresolved migration crisis
