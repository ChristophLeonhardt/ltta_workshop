let's talk about the the teacher strike because in Arizona because I showed you before Michael Moore talked about the West Virginia teacher strike and it was super successful and only took nine days and they won big meaning they got education funded instead of funding a war or giving a tax break to a coal company they decided to fund education in West Virginia and Michael Moore was on a town hall with Bernie Sanders and he was lamenting the lack of coverage about the West Virginia teacher strike when Michael Moore was highlighting that he talked about how I believe the Union is made up of 74% of women and I just want to add additionally that this Union wasn't just trying to protect their interests their owned interests as teachers but they wanted not they wanted the clerical staff to be supported and other government agencies so it's like this one Union teachers union is taking on a lot of people right now on behalf of other members one on members rather and one thing that I'm really happy about is that the unions are actually fighting for education not just our own pay so in many instances the state is trying to pay off the Union by saying we'll give you raises go away and the union is saying that's not good enough we don't want just raises we want the infrastructure to be there for children's that we can have a proper educational framework in place so they want funding for facilities for books and other institutions educational infrastructure that's necessary for a vibrant and and an effective educational process so I like it I like I love it that the teachers are not just taking their own money and just gone away come on don't you want teachers who are paid well don't you want that this particular profession attracts professionals and that you know really I think teachers should be making six figures you know the amount of effort that it takes to instruct a class and to procure units of study that are not only engaging but relevant to students life it's hard it's challenging and you know that these teachers that teachers who taught for 13 years in West were only making under $40,000 a year that's awful 13 years in service for public education so I walk with teachers I support teachers and I support unions because they're there to protect the workers so here's what Michael Moore had to say about the West Virginia teachers strike this Union brought down the state apparatus at 75% women in this union and they rose up and in Bernie I didn't see hardly anything in the corporate media about this on any of the networks even some of the networks that we watch you know Russia turn the channel Russia Russia shouts call me dead Daniel's and Don jr. and you know warworld's all the shiny keys to distract us that's what goes on in the media all the other things that we they talk about and we should be seeing this this we should see we should know about the West Virginia teacher strike and the victory would it be inspiration that would be around the country if they if you saw people in West Virginia do this never had a strike like this and forever and it's they don't show this Bernie because what would happen if they did okay so what would happen if they did well I'm going to show you what what's been happening defiant no more Arizona Governor Benson teachers demand so that's what is gonna happen now so it's catching on so I went from West Virginia and it went to Kentucky Oklahoma and now it's in Arizona these are all red states these are unions breaking the back of their right wing legislators because they have the truth on their side we need to fund education okay so let's just break it down with very briefly what's going on in Arizona as recently as Tuesday a defiant Arizona Governor refused to meet with teep notices last Tuesday teachers threatening to strike over low pay and said he was sticking with a one percent raise proposal pretty ballsy huh pretty policy but by Thursday Republican Doug Ducey managed to scrape 274 million dollars from the cash starved state's coffers to offer a nine percent wage hike starting this fall and he's following that with a five percent more each in 2019 and 2020 school years but it's kind of amazing how he went from no screw you 1% that's it to all of a sudden look at that a 10 percent raises an unbelievable yeah and for those who think that's that's an excessive raise it's only because they had cut cultures pay by a billion dollars yeah so now it's a bit of a ketchup plus a little bit of a modest normal raise not a large ring right at all yeah you know the teachers are really raking they're raking in those money-grubbers right so here we go he's also counting the 1% raise the legislature approved for the school current school to call it a 20% overall raise it's amazing when a threatened teacher strike in an election year can get the Republicans to do set Democratic Representative Rebecca Rios I'm impressed Joe Thomas president of the Arizona Education Association warned against relying on promises don't believe anything besides what they put in the budget he said a legislature that says they're going to give us a 5% raise in a budget a year away well they might as well promise every kid and guard a teacher a pony so Ducey's plan does not include pay raises for others including school counselors custodians and lunchroom workers and stuff this is what they were holding out for in Oklahoma right I know it's everybody else and you also have to give money to our books and you have to give money for air conditioning and you have to give money to the cafeteria staff and the janitor so the teachers were the ones leading the way on this so isn't it something that it takes a group of majority women to show grit and strength and stand up to for what's right if you enjoyed this clip of aggressive progressives you know there's a 90-minute show waiting for you at the Young Turks Network go to tea white tea network.com slash join to see all our
