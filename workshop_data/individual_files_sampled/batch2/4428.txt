but 15 days to go 15 until the midterm elections and with much at stake the new NBC news/wall Street Journal poll suggests it is difficult to tell what the outcome will be think about that according to the poll 50% of likely voters are inclined to support candidates from the Democratic Party while 41% are for the Republicans at the same time president Trump's approval rating among this group of voters is at 45% some of the best marks of his presidency this as enthusiasm about the election is up among core groups that support Democrats 72% of the party's voters have high interest in the election up 25 points from 2014 while at 71% Hispanic voters have seen a 33 point increased in interest from the last midterm elections high interest is at 68% among black voters 67 percent among women fifty-one percent among young voters that's a 22 point bump from 2014 and Joe you just have to wonder though is that good for Trump that interest growing or is it good for the Democrats well John Highland you look at a lot of numbers first of all the key numbers said that we always look at three of them about this time one of them has to do with the president's approval rating it's higher than it's ever been or as high as it's ever been you look at the ballot test and the NBC poll it has tightened and gotten closer eight nine points you look at intensity intensity is up among Democrats but after Kavanagh it's up among Republicans as well this race does not look to be the foregone conclusion at once was and Democrats appear to be even the losing ground in the Senate where do you put it 15 days out yeah there's no doubt about all that I think the the notion that I think the conventional wisdom is basically still the Democrats have the bar more likely than not by a reasonable amount more likely to take control of the house the question is like how big by how much and the situation for Democrats in the Senate which again maybe a month ago people were starting to think there was some chance that Democrats might be able to thread the needle and take control of the Senate that is more or less gone for most people's scenarios now it is the case that if history is a guide if you look at where Donald Trump's approval rating is right now and you compare it to where Barack Obama's approval rating was in 2010 that would foretell a large swing in the house but I think Obama lost I think the Democrats lost having 69-66 somewhere in the mid to high 60s of seats in 2010 and if you look back at Bill Clinton even back into 1994 a similar kind of thing happened now does history hold this history governing the era of Donald Trump I don't know but there's no question that a combination of the post Kavanaugh that posed the new post Cavanaugh landscape and the natural tightening that we were going to see in any circumstance in October those things have Democrats worried and those things I think rightfully had Democrats worried that this is certainly not going to be a slam dunk for them as people thought for most of this year it certainly doesn't look like this anomaly Steve Kornacki that everybody was talking about this I mean you go in the House races I know a lot of people that have studied all the house races I know you certainly have they still see an outside path to Republicans actually retaining control of the United States House maybe they lose 18 maybe they lose 19 seats that would have been unthinkable even to three months ago well where do you see it right now yeah I think what John said is correct look the Democrats are still more likely than not to take the House the Senate looks like it's changed pretty dramatically in the Republicans favor in the last few weeks I think that the two big variables where we've seen movement that sort of accounts for this at number one you put the president's job approval number up there just overall poll after poll when you average it together he's at sort of the high point here the high-water mark you know almost for his entire presidency Oh absent the first in a week or so when he had the closest thing to a honeymoon he was never gonna have his president but he's sitting there in the the average of all polls at about 44 percent approval you know Republicans said just given the nature of the map they thought if they could get him into the mid-40s they might have a fighting chance of keeping the house but the they're big variable that's changed in the last few weeks is the question of enthusiasm and this isn't to say that anything has changed on the Democratic side with enthusiasm because Democratic enthusiasm has been through the roof from the minute Donald Trump was elected two years ago it is still through the roof the thing that's changed is the Republican enthusiasm has ticked up not quite equal with the Democratic number but getting closer to it and when you think back to those past midterm landslides John was talking about 2006 2010 even 2014 when the Republicans had a sneaky midterm landslide that kind of came on late you ended up seeing double-digit enthusiasm gaps between the parties in those years and right now what we're seeing is there was seem to be the potential for that over the summer when Democrats were talking about making inroads beyond just the suburbs making inroads well in the Trump Country 4050 C gains that kind of thing it seems that the Republicans have gotten close to parity on enthusiasm not enough where I think they're all favored to keep the house or anything but enough where the conversations changed Kristin Kristin let me ask you a question off of this we talk everyday about the horse races the House the Senate we talk every day about voter enthusiasm or lack of enthusiasm Democrats versus Republicans in your polling in your experience there's another issue out there I'm wondering if it registers as deeply as the day-to-day stuff does we have a deeply and intentionally dishonest President of the United States who takes to the country multiple times a week with the single intent of dividing the country with deep deep lies that twist and turn facts into myth does that register in poll after poll when you ask people what attributes they assigned to the president trustworthiness is not one that he does well on even the model Republicans so voters already sort of know that and I feel like it's baked in delivers I think it's just sort of an accepted thing that you get with Trump but you also get good economic growth and for some voters that's the bargain they've they've chosen to strike and so when you look at the top issues in that NBC Wall Street Journal poll the top issue is the economy 38% of voters said that's their top issue and Republicans in this poll are winning on that issue by the largest margin I think it said in the history of the NBC Wall Street Journal poll so it's a trade-off that voters are making in their mind where they're like yeah he's he's kind of a jerk but he's our jerk and maybe the economy is going well I think that's the way a lot of voters are thinking about this there's one other issue that stuck out to me in this poll that that I think is why we have such a sense of this election being up in the air and that's the question of change now normally in these midterm elections when you've got a new president in power the party out of power is challenging it's really we need change we need something different and sure enough when I go into focus groups and ask people what are they thinking they say I feel like we can't keep going on like this but in this NBC Wall Street Journal poll Republicans win among those on the question of who's gonna bring about change to Washington which is a very strange dynamic for a midterm election like this Joe I would submit that the acceptance of a deeply deeply deeply dishonest president the acceptance of that among people is the single most important issue of our day well I it is and and that you have to ask what's the alternative to Donald Trump I I think one of the most fascinating and disturbing polls said that we saw weekend and week out during 2016 was honest and trustworthy numbers Donald Trump was in the mid 30s at times Hillary Clinton was lower than that but when people went to the voting booth actually Hillary Clinton had lower honest and trustworthy numbers than Donald Trump right now there is no national Democrat to balance that against right now those national Democrats if you ask people would say it is Nancy Pelosi it is Elizabeth Warren it is Dianne Feinstein it is perhaps Chuck Schumer but you know Mika it is an absolute mess and Dianne Feinstein of course her name get he got thrown out there because they Cavanaugh hearings and and the numbers I I looked at you look at voter intensity we say in these midterms it's not the generic ballot test that matters it's voter intensity Democrats had double-digit leads Mika before the Cavanaugh hearings they disappeared in a big way well after the cats news that no Democrat wants to hear that perhaps the Cavanaugh hearings were more misplayed look last week I expressed concern that Democrats were blowing the midterm elections despite the fact that it should not be closed this did not get a good reaction all day on Friday after looking at the latest polling though and reporting out there that concern has become a grim acceptance that my party is potentially falling short again if America's reaction to nearly two years of Donald Trump as president it is to reward him with continued Republican control of the Senate and the house that would be disastrous on so many levels to mention but that possibility is rising by the day look at the numbers unless Americans do something about it over the next two weeks the new NBC news/wall Street Journal poll shows Republicans interest in the elections is up thanks in part to the Cavanaugh hearings and president Trump's approval ratings are in the mid-40s think about that nearly half of the people in this country approve of the job this man is doing even after charlottesville porn stars his humiliation in Helsinki bowing to kim jeong-hoon ripping babies from their mother's calling hispanics breeders destroying America's most critical alliances and bankrupting our country and we could go on with just over two weeks to go our Democrats still lulling themselves into believing that they will win simply because Trump is abhorrent and history is on their side that was not enough in 2016 it wasn't and it won't be enough now this is hard to say people don't want to hear it but the party badly Mis played the Cavanaugh hearings like Hillary they lack a message and their leaders lack heart and unless trends change over the next 15 days Democrats are going to wake up to the same kind of political reckoning they did two years ago and at least I believe that will prove a disaster for the Democratic Party the tradition of divided government and the dream of American democracy that's where it's all on the line right now and so much Jon Meacham is on the line over the next couple of weeks and mica spelled it out and there are a lot of people a lot of not just Democrats there are a lot of Republicans independents that are going wait a second after Charlottesville after a policy that intentionally puts children in cages and rips babies from their mother's arms intentionally after porn stores after the humiliation at Helsinki after I we could go down the list Donald Trump saying he was in love with kim jeong-hoon embarrassing himself thereafter destroying our alliances and after putting america on the path to bankruptcy highest national debt ever massive deficit 45% of Americans still say yeah I approve of his job as president that that is very vexing for the the 55% of us who don't approve of the way he's handling himself in the White House how do we how do we put that into perspective John I think 55:45 is a pretty good way of thinking about it Trump is not a wholly new force in American politics he's the but he is the most vivid manifestation of many of our worst characteristics and we have to be honest about that Harry Truman once said that we get the government we deserve politicians are far more often mirrors of who we are than they are molders we like the idea that people that look like in Shakespeare's history plays you know henry v shapes who we are far more often they reflect who we are and you know the constitution was written for moments like this it assumed that we were sinful and driven by ambition and appetite and greed swype they made it so hard for us to get anything done they basically bet that we would get things wrong more often than we get them right and we have proven them correct with astonishing regularity this is this is an extreme moment but it's not a wholly separate moment and I think that until we genuinely grapple with the fact that Donald Trump hasn't hijacked the country he's just magnified our darker elements we probably can't really come to the kind of resolution we need to come to Amica he has he has magnified that and again the what we bumped in with at the top of this block is a perfect example here you have something that every president would go out and say you know what Democrats and Republicans still can work together we still can get things done take for instance our work together on both sides of the aisle to try to face down the scourge of opioids and that epidemic that's killing so many people ruining be present most presidents would take great heart in that because that's making Washington work Donald Trump takes that he lies and tears it to shreds tries to make it partisan it it's that's his game we'll see if he's rewarded still ahead on
