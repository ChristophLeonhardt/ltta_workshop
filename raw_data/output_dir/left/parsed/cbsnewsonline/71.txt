FORMER SENATORS AS WELL, SOME 
WHO STILL LIVE HERE IN 
WASHINGTON. 
AND SOME FLEW INTO TOWN FOR 
THIS. 
A FAIR AMOUNT 
OF THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS HERE IN 
WASHINGTON. 
WE FORGET THAT THEY ARE ALWAYS 
INVITED TO THESE SUCH EVENTS. 
HE IS ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE IN 
THAT ROTUNDA WHOM I HAVE KNOWN 
ALL OF THEM BY NAME. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
A GREAT ADVOCATE FOR AMERICAN 
DIPLOMACY AS WELL. 
I WANT TO GO TO CHIP REID OUR 
RESPONDENT AT THE CAPITAL RIGHT 
NOW. 
CHIP, CAN YOU DESCRIBE FOR US 
WHAT THE FEELING IS THERE? 
WE HEAR THE SILENCE THAT IS SO 
POWERFUL BUT TELL US WHAT YOU 
ARE SEEING. 
>> Reporter: THE SILENCE ITSELF 
IS SO POWERFUL, I AM SEEING 
FAMILY MEMBERS GET IN THE THREE 
VANS THAT ARE POSITIONED IN THE 
MOTORCADE TO FOLLOW THE HEARSE 
OUT ONTO CONSTITUTION AVENUE 
WHERE PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY 
GATHERED TO PAY THEIR LAST 
RESPECTS. 
I SAW MEGAN McCAIN WHO WE HAVE 
ALL SEEN HAS BEEN EXTREMELY 
EMOTIONAL THROUGH THIS. 
WHEN I COVERED THE McCAIN 
CAMPAIGN BACK IN 2008 SHE WAS 
THERE CONSTANTLY. 
SHE WAS ALWAYS BY HER FATHER'S 
SIDE. 
CINDY McCAIN, SENATOR. 
McCAIN'S WIFE,  ALSO GOT INTO 
THE VANS. 
YESTERDAY THERE WERE ABOUT 21 
MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY, NOT 
WHITE AS MANY THIS TIME. 
I DON'T THINK THERE WERE ANY 
GRANDCHILDREN, HE HAS FIVE 
GRANDCHILDREN AND SEVEN 
CHILDREN AS YOU NO. 
LOTS OF SPOUSES. 
A BROTHER AND A SISTER AND HIS 
106-YEAR-OLD MOTHER, ROBERTA, 
WHO IS LISTED IN THE PRESS 
GUIDE IS 106 YEARS YOUNG. 
THAT IS VERY MUCH A STATEMENT 
OF FACT. 
I DID NOT SEE HERE, I'M NOT 
SURE IF ANY OF YOU DID, THEY 
ARE WAITING FOR THE HEARSE TO 
BEGIN MOVING BEHIND THE POLICE 
ESCORT AND THEN HAD OUT ONTO 
CONSTITUTION AVENUE. 
THIS IS THE FINAL GOODBYE TO 
JOHN McCAIN FROM THE PLACE THAT 
HE LOVED SO MUCH. 
>> AND ED, I NO YOU HAVE BEEN 
DOING SOME REPORTING AROUND 
THIS. 
ROBERTA McCAIN REALLY CAPTURED 
SO MUCH ATTENTION YESTERDAY 
BECAUSE SHE APPEARED SO STOIC. 
>> ABSOLUTELY, AND REALLY 
GRIPPING THE HAND OF MEGAN 
McCAIN THROUGH MOST OF THAT 
CEREMONY. 
I WAS TOLD BY SOMEONE CLOSE TO 
THE FAMILY THAT AFTERWARD SHE 
ACTUALLY GAVE A PEP TALK AND 
TOLD EVERYONE IN THE FAMILY AND 
SOME OTHER FRIENDS, DON'T BE 
GLUM, DON'T BE DOWNTRODDEN, HE 
HAD A GREAT LIFE. 
THE FAMILY HAS GREAT FAITH AND 
THEY ARE GOING TO BE STRONG TO 
ALL OF THIS. 
SHE LIVES HERE IN WASHINGTON, 
WHICH IS WHY SHE WAS NOT IN 
ARIZONA EARLIER IN THE WEEK. 
IT WAS QUITE A SIGHT TO SEE 
YESTERDAY. 
YOU THINK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE 
ICONIC IN AMERICAN HISTORY AND 
YOU THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE 
BEHIND THEM. 
SHE IS A WOMAN, MOTHER OF A 
SENATOR, DAUGHTER-IN-LAW OF AN 
ADMIRAL, WIFE OF AN ADMIRAL, 
SOMEONE WHO PLAYED A CRITICAL 
ROLE IN PROPPING UP REALLY 
IMPORTANT PEOPLE. 
>> AND WE THINK OF HIM BEING 
THE SON OF AN ADMIRAL AND THE 
GRANT SEVEN OF -- GRANDSON OF 
AN INTEGRAL, BUT HE WAS REALLY 
A MAMA'S BOY, YOU CAN HEAR HIM 
TELL IT, SHE WAS A GREAT 
INFLUENE IN HIS LIFE. 
AND SOMETIMES AT THE SENATE HE 
WOULD SAY DO YOU NO WHAT SHE 
DID THIS MORNING? 
IT WAS REALLY FUN TO TALK TO 
HIM ABOUT IT, HE LOVED HER TO 
DEATH. 
>> ON THIS DAY OF SUMMER 
REMEMBRANCE IT IS IMPORTANT THAT
WE REMEMBER, HE WAS ALWAYS 
STOPPING AND TELLING A STORY 
OUT OF THE SIDE OF HIS MOUTH, 
THAT SPARK THAT FIRE, THAT 
ENERGY, THAT COMES FROM WITHIN. 
>> HE WAS NOTHING IF NOT 
IRREVERENT. 
HE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN A KICK OUT 
OF THIS IF THEY WERE GOING TO 
RENAME THE RUSSELL BUILDING. 
WHEN I CAME TO WASHINGTON THOSE 
BUILDINGS DIDN'T HAVE A NAME, 
THEY WERE THE NEW SENATE OFFICE 
BUILDING AND RUSSELL WAS THE 
OLD ONE AND McCAIN ALWAYS 
POINTED OUT, HE ALWAYS CALLED 
IT THE OLD SOP. 
>> AND GOOGLE EVEN ALREADY 
RENAMED IT. 
IF YOU PULL UP YOUR GOOGLE MAP 
IN WASHINGTON DC, IT IS RENAMED 
TO THE McCAIN SENATE BUILDING. 
>> THERE WAS A MAKESHIFT 
MEMORIAL THIS WEEK, PEOPLE HAD 
JUST COME TO THE EDGE OF THE 
RUSSELL SENATE OFFICE BUILDING 
TO LEAVE FLOWERS AND NOTES AND 
LETTERS IN REMEMBRANCE OF THE 
SENATOR. 
>> THERE IS SOME DEBATE OVER 
EXACTLY HOW TO HONOR SENATOR. 
McCAIN,  I NO JOHN YOU WERE 
TALKING TO HIS DEAR FRIEND 
LINDSEY GRAHAM THIS WEEK ABOUT 
JUST THAT. 
HE SAID HE WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE 
TO SEE SOME LEGISLATION RESULT 
FROM THIS MOMENT. 
>> HE SUGGESTED MAYBE 
IMMIGRATION REFORM MIGHT BE 
SOMETHING, WE WERE TALKING 
ABOUT McCAIN BEING AT THE HEART 
OF EVERY FIGHT AND THAT WAS ONE 
OF THEM, IMMIGRATION REFORM. 
>> A FIGHT HE NEVER QUITE ONE. 
>> JUST LIKE HE DIDN'T WIN THE 
TOBACCO FIGHT, JUST LIKE HIS 
FIGHT FOR CAMPAIGN-FINANCE 
REFORM WAS HOLLOWED OUT BY THE 
COURTS, A LOT OF THOSE FIGHTS 
ARE FIGHTS THAT HE TRIED AND 
EITHER HE WON THEM OR HAD A LOT 
OF PUSHBACK AND WAS UNABLE TO 
WIN. 
BUT LINDSAY SAID HE WANTED TO 
NAME THE VISITOR CENTER AT THE 
CAPITAL BECAUSE ONE, IT WOULD 
BE WHERE ALL VISITORS TO THE 
CAPITAL WOULD SEE AND THEY 
WOULD LEARN ABOUT THE LIFE OF 
JOHN McCAIN, BUT ALSO IN 
KEEPING WITH THE IRREVERENCE 
THAT BOB TALKED ABOUT, JOHN 
McCAIN DIDN'T LIKE, THE FIRST 
TIME I REPORTED ABOUT HIM IT 
WAS ABOUT BUDGET MATTERS, HE 
DIDN'T LIKE OVERSPENDING AND HE 
DIDN'T LIKE THE CAPITAL VISITOR 
CENTER AT ALL. 
LINDSAY THOUGHT NAMING IT AFTER 
HIM WOULD BE THE NICE FINAL 
LITTLE RIBBING TO HIM. 
BECAUSE HE HATED THE 
EXPENDITURE OF THE PEOPLE'S 
MONEY ON THAT VISITOR CENTER. 
>>  A 
SENSE OF HUMOR THERE AS WE 
WATCH THE MOTORCADE PROCEED, WE 
NOTE THAT THE SENATOR HAD SPENT 
A GREAT DEAL OF TIME OVER THE 
PAST YEAR, THAT HE HAS BEEN 
BATTLING, 13 MONTHS EXACTLY 
THAT HE HAS BEEN BATTLING BRAIN 
CANCER, TO THINK ABOUT HOW HE 
WANTED TO SPEND THIS FINAL TRIP 
THROUGH WASHINGTON, AND WHAT HE 
WANTED TO PAY HOMAGE TO WITH 
HIS LIFE. 
I THINK IT IS VERY SIGNIFICANT, 
A DECISION ON HIS PART TO GO 
FROM THE CAPITAL TO THE VIETNAM 
WAR MEMORIAL. 
BEFORE HE GOES ON TO THE 
CATHEDRAL. 
NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE HISTORY 
HE HAS, 5 1/2 YEARS AS A 
PRISONER OF WAR IN VIETNAM. 
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT HIS 
MOTHER. 
I NO IN SOME OF HIS OWN 
WRITINGS ABOUT HIS PARENTS HE 
SAID AT FIRST HIS MOM DID NOT 
THINK HE HAD SURVIVED BEING 
SHOT DOWN AND IT WAS HIS FATHER 
WHO SAID NO, HE SURVIVED. 
BUT CAN YOU IMAGINE AS A PARENT 
THROUGH ALL OF THAT, KNOWING 
THAT YOUR CHILD -- 
>> SHE ALWAYS SAID NAVY TOUGH. 
AND SHE CERTAINLY WAS. 
>> WE KNOW THE MOTORCADE IS 
HEADED TO THE VIETNAM MEMORIAL, 
SOME 58,000 NAMES INSCRIBED 
THERE ON THE WALLS OF THAT 
MEMORIAL. 
TO THOSE KILLED, TO THOSE 
MISSING. 
>> JOHN McCAIN USED TO MAKE 
REGULAR VISITS TO THE MEMORIAL 
IN THE MORNING. 
JUST QUIETLY WITHOUT ANY FAN 
FIRE -- FANFARE BUT MADE QUIET 
AND REGULAR VISITS TO THE 
MEMORIAL TO REMEMBER, TO VISIT 
WITH OTHER FAMILIES THAT WERE 
THERE, SO THIS IS A PART, THIS 
WOULD HAVE BEEN PART OF HIS 
REGULAR WASHINGTON LIFE, TOO. 
TO STOP BY THE MEMORIAL. 
>>> I WANT TO GO NOW TO OUR 
CORRESPONDENT WAS AT THE 
VIETNAM VETERANS MEMORIAL. 
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING THERE? 
I NO YESTERDAY THERE WERE 
VETERANS LINED UP AT THE 
CAPITAL TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS. 
WHAT ARE WE SEEING AT THE 
MEMORIAL TODAY X 
>> Reporter: GOOD MORNING 
MARGARET, AND DESPITE THE 
IMPERFECT WEATHER OUT HERE ON 
THE NATIONAL MALL WE ARE SEEING 
A SIMILAR LINE THAT WE SAW 
YESTERDAY AT THE CAPITAL OVER 
BY -- OVER MY SHOULDER YOU CAN 
SEE FOLKS LINED UP ESTABLISHING 
A WALL BETWEEN US AND THE 
VIETNAM MEMORIAL. 
ALL OUT HERE TO PAY THEIR 
RESPECTS. PEOPLE LOOKING ON IN 
TRYING TO GET AS CLOSE AS 
POSSIBLE, IT IS QUIET AND 
SOLEMN AT THE MOMENT. 
SOME VETERANS OUT HERE, VIETNAM 
VETERANS, SAILORS IN THEIR 
DRESS WHITES, ALL WAITING FOR 
THE McCAIN FAMILY WHO AS YOU 
MENTIONED ARE ON THEIR WAY, 
ARRIVING HERE AT ANY MOMENT TO 
PAY THEIR RESPECTS. 
A NOD TO THE SENATORS SERVICE. 
AND TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS TO AS 
YOU MENTIONED THE 58,000 
VETERANS WHOSE NAMES ARE 
ENGRAVED ON THAT WALL BEHIND 
US. 
YOU MENTIONED THIS IS A 
CONSCIOUS STOP, A DELIBERATE 
STOP HERE AT THE VIETNAM 
MEMORIAL. 
HE WOULD LIKE TO COME OUT HERE 
WITHOUT ANY FANFARE OR 
PUBLICITY, HE WOULD COME OUT 
HERE SOMETIMES IN THE MORNING 
TO PAY HIS RESPECTS, HE WOULD 
COME OUT LATE IN THE EVENING AS 
THE SUN WAS SETTING, AND HE 
DESCRIBED THE LOCATION AS A 
PLACE OF HEALING. 
BUT HE DID ADMIT THAT IT TOOK 
HIM A WHILE TO COME AROUND. 
AT FIRST HE DESCRIBED THINKING 
THE DESIGN WAS A LITTLE BLEAK 
BUT THEN HE WOULD TELL A STORY 
ABOUT COMING OUT HERE ONE 
MORNING AND LOOKING ON AND 
SEEING A COUPLE OF VETERANS WHO 
CLEARLY DID NOT SEEM TO NO AGE 
OTHER BUT STRUCK UP A 
CONVERSATION AND HE SORT OF 
LOOKED ON AS THEY TALKED A 
LITTLE BIT. 
HE CAME TO QUICKLY REALIZE THAT 
THEY SERVED AT THE SAME TIME IN 
THE SAME LOCATION IN VIETNAM. 
THEY EMBRACED AND BEFORE THE 
END OF THE CONVERSATION THEY 
WERE EMOTIONAL AND EMBRACING. 
AND CENTER -- CENTER -- 
SENATOR. 
McCAIN DESCRIBED THAT THIS WAS 
THE MOMENT HE REALIZED  THIS 
PLACE WAS EVERYTHING THEY HOPED 
IT WOULD BE. 
IT WAS A PLACE OF HEALING AND A 
PLACE OF RECONCILIATION. 
THIS MORNING IT IS A PLACE 
WHERE AS WE SAID A FEW HUNDRED 
FOLKS ARE OUT HERE WAITING FOR 
THE FAMILY SO THEY CAN LOOK ON 
AND PAY THEIR RESPECTS AND SAY 
THEIR FAREWELLS. 
>> AND WE ARE LOOKING AT SOME 
OF THE PHOTOS THAT WERE RELEASED
OF HIS 5 1/2 YEARS IN 
CAPTIVITY. 
3 1/2 YEARS IN SOLITARY 
CONFINEENT DURING THAT TIME. 
AT WHAT IS REFERRED TO AS THE 
HANOI HILTON. 
AS A PRISONER OF WAR. 
I NO BOB YOU COVERED THE WAR 
FIRST-HAND AND SO MUCH OF THE 
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE WAR HAS 
CHANGED IN THIS COUNTRY. 
AND JOHN McCAIN PLAYED A VERY 
BIG ROLE IN DOING THAT, IN 
ENDING THE WAR ABOUT THE WAR. 
>> HE PLAYED AN ENORMOUS ROLE 
IN THAT. 
HE WAS AS YOU ALL NO, -- KNOW, 
WAS VERY IMPORTANT AND PLAYED A 
KEY ROLE IN GETTING THE REMAINS 
OF MANY OF THE MISSING BACK 
INTO THIS COUNTRY. 
AND OF WORSE JOHN McCAIN WENT 
TO VIETNAM AND ASKED, AND FOR 
GAVE HIS CAPTORS. 
THE PEOPLE WHO HAD TORTURED 
HIM. 
BECAUSE OF THAT IT SPEEDED UP 
OUR ABILITY TO REESTABLISH 
RELATIONS WITH VIETNAM. 
WE WOULD HAVE DONE IT, IT WOULD 
HAVE TAKEN TIME, BUT HE SPED 
THAT ALONG AND PLAYED A KEY 
ROLE IN THAT. 
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT JOHN 
McCAIN, THROUGH FORGIVENESS, 
ACCOMPLISHED WHAT WE WERE 
UNABLE TO DO WITH ALL OF OUR 
WEAPONS OF WAR. 
HE WAS ABLE TO ESTABLISH 
RELATIONS WITH A COUNTRY THAT 
TURNED OUT TO BE A KEY ALLY FOR 
THE UNITED STATES. 
AND IF WE EVER NEEDED A KEY 
ALLY IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD, 
RIGHT NOW IS THE TIME. 
>> HE IS CELEBRATED THERE. 
IT'S TREMENDOUS. 
>> WHEN HE CAMPAIGNED IN 2000, 
BUT ALSO IN 2008, HE WAS 
TELLING THE STORY OF THE 
VIETNAM WAR FROM A DIFFERENT 
ANGLE. 
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A WAR THAT AT 
THE TIME SPLIT AMERICA, THERE 
WERE PROTESTS AND IT DID NOT, 
WE TALK ABOUT THE GREATEST 
GENERATION. 
THAT IS THE WORLD WAR II 
GENERATION. 
VIETNAM HAS HAD A BUMPY HISTORY 
AND WHEN YOU SAW PEOPLE AT 
McCAIN RALLIES IN 2000 IN 
PARTICULAR HE WOULD TELL THE 
STORIES OF SERVICE AND 
SACRIFICE THAT HE WITNESSED 
WITH HIS OWN EYES. 
AND PEOPLE, TEARS WOULD COME TO 
THEIR EYES AND THEY WOULD LEAP 
FROM THEIR SEATS TO APPLAUD 
WHEN HE WAS DONE TELLING THE 
STORIES. 
IT WAS IN FUSING THEM IN THE 
VIETNAM WAR, ALL THE BEST 
TRADITIONS OF AMERICAN SERVICE 
AND SACRIFICE WHICH HAD NOT 
ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE WITH THAT 
WAR. 
HIS PERSONAL STORY AND HIS 
CAMPAIGNS ALSO CHANGED THE WAY 
PEOPLE THOUGHT ABOUT THE 
VIETNAM WAR. 
>> THAT YOU COULD DISAGREE WITH 
THE WAR BUT NOT DISHONOR THOSE 
WHO HAD SERVED IN IT. 
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. 
AND THAT YOU WERE KEEPING FAITH 
WITH A CERTAIN SET OF ENDURING 
AMERICAN GOALS, EVEN IN THE 
SERVICE OF A WAR THAT PEOPLE 
MIGHT DEBATE ABOUT, ONE OF THE 
THINGS SAID ABOUT JOHN McCAIN 
AND I CAN'T REMEMBERWHO SAID 
IT, HE COULD HAVE LIVED IN ANY 
TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY. 
WHICH IS TO SAY HE WOULD'VE FIT 
RIGHT IN WITH TEDDY ROOSEVELT 
AMERICA, HE WOULD FIT RIGHT IN 
WITH THE REVOLUTION BECAUSE OF 
HIS DEDICATION TO THOSE BASIC 
AMERICAN PRINCIPLES. 
>> I WANT TO BRING IN TO THE 
CONVERSATION CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL
CORRESPONDENT NANCY CORDIS AS 
WE MOVE FROM THE MEMORIAL TO 
THE NATIONAL CATHEDRAL WHERE WE 
FIND NANCY THIS MORNING. 
THAT IS WHERE THE MOTORCADE 
WILL BE HEADING NEXT TO BEGIN 
THE SERVICE. 
NANCY? 
>> Reporter: MARGARET WE HAVE 
BEGUN TO SEE PEOPLE STREAMING 
INTO THE NATIONAL CATHEDRAL FOR 
ABOUT THE PAST HOUR OR SO, 
DIGNITARIES FROM ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY, WE SPOTTED SECRETARY 
OF STATE MADELEINE ALBRIGHT 
HEADING IN, THE ACTORS WARREN 
BEATTY AND HIS WIFE ANNETTE 
BENNING, JOURNALISTS 
CONSERVATIVE THINKERS, LIBERAL 
THINKERS, THERE ARE 4000 PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE BEEN INVITED TO THIS 
CEREMONY. 
AND IT IS BY INVITATION ONLY. 
AS YOU POINTED OUT EARLIER 
MARGARET, EVERYTHING IN THE 
PROGRAM YOU WILL SEE TODAY WAS 
DICTATED BY McCAIN HIMSELF. 
SO WHEN YOU HEAR THE FAMOUS 
OPERA SINGER RENC FLEMING 
BELTING OUT DANNY BOY, THAT IS 
NO ACCIDENT. 
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT JOHN 
McCAIN HIMSELF WANTED. 
THAT IS THE WAY THAT HE WANTED 
TO BE SENT OFF. 
I AM HERE THIS MORNING WITH 
SENATOR. 
TOM UDALL OF NEW MEXICO, A 
DEMOCRAT , SERVED IN THE SENATE 
FOR THE PAST DECADE WITH JOHN 
McCAIN. 
BUT YOU GO BACK SO MUCH FARTHER 
THAN THAT WITH THIS MAN. 
>> I REALLY DO. 
NANCY I KNEW JOHN WHEN I WAS 
MUCH YOUNGER, WHEN I WAS A 
TEENAGER BECAUSE MY UNCLE MOE 
TALKED A LOT ABOUT HIM. 
HE TALKED ABOUT THE 
RELATIONSHIP THEY HAD WORKING 
ACROSS PARTY LINES. 
>> YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT MOE 
UDALL, CONGRESSMAN FROM 
ARIZONA, DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE 
FOR PRESIDENT. 
AND REALLY REVERED 
BY A YOUNG CONGRESSMAN McCAIN. 
>> A WONDERFUL STORY IS THAT 
MOE HAD 14 YEARS IN THE HOUSE 
AND HE TOOK JOHN AND UNDER HIS 
WING AND TRAVELED AROUND NEW 
MEXICO WITH HIM. 
AND ARIZONA. 
AND THE ENTIRE SOUTHWEST AND HE 
SAID THIS IS WHAT THE SOUTHWEST 
IS ABOUT BECAUSE JOHN WAS NEW 
TO THE WHOLE REGION. 
HE SAID NATIVE AMERICANS WE'VE 
GOT TO WORK TOGETHER ON THESE 
ISSUES AND FROM THEN ON THAT'S 
WHAT THEY DID TOGETHER. 
>> Reporter: WHAT WAS IT ABOUT 
A YOUNG REPUBLICAN THAT LED MOE 
UDALL TO TAKE HIM UNDER HIS 
WING? 
>> I THINK HE SAW THE PROMISE 
IN JOHN McCAIN AND SAW THAT HE 
HAD A REAL CORE AND THAT HE 
REALLY CARED ABOUT 
BIPARTISANSHIP. REALLY WORKING 
WITH THE OTHER SIDE AND 
TACKLING THE BIG ISSUES. 
THAT IS THE THING TO ME THAT IS 
JUST SO DIFFERENT ABOUT JOHN 
McCAIN. 
HE HAD THOSE CORE ISSUES 
WHETHER IT WAS CLIMATE CHANGE 
OR IMMIGRATION OR ON THE ISSUE 
OF HEALTHCARE WHERE HE SAID YOU 
CAN FOLLOW THIS REGULAR ORDER 
SO I'M HOLDING DOWN THE 
HEALTHCARE, HE WAS JUST A 
SPECIAL PERSON TO ALL OF US. 
BUT ESPECIALLY ON THE 
DEMOCRATIC SIDE WHERE WE DON'T 
HAVE MUCH OF THAT ANYMORE. 
THAT IS THE THING I AM GOING TO 
MISS THE MOST I THINK. 
>> Reporter: I NO YOU WILL MISS 
HIM ON A PERSONAL LEVEL AND A 
POLITICAL LEVEL. 
MARGARET? 
>> NANCY THANK YOU AND WE ARE 
WATCHING ON THE SCREEN, NOT 
ONLY THE SPLIT SCREEN OF THE 
VIETNAM VETERANS MEMORIAL, WITH 
MORE THAN 58,000 NAMES 
INSCRIBED OF THOSE WHO SERVED 
BESIDE SENATOR. 
McCAIN ON THE BATTLEFIELD BUT 
ON THE RIGHT SIDE THOSE WHO 
SERVED  WITH HIM IN CONGRESS. 
YOU'RE SEEING A NUMBER OF 
SITTING SENATORS GATHERED FROM 
BOTH PARTIES ALONG WITH SOME 
CELEBRITIES. 
WE HAVE A GUEST LIST HERE, IT 
READS LIKE THAT OF AHEAD OF 
STATE. 
GOVERNORS, PRESIDENTS, FOREIGN 
MINISTERS, PRIME MINISTERS, AND 
OF COURSE JOHN WE ALSO SEE 
PRISONERS OF WAR. 
WHO SERVED WITH HIM. 
>> THAT IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND 
THEY WILL BE HIS PALLBEARERS ON 
SUNDAY, THOSE PRISONERS OF WAR 
WHO SERVED WITH HIM. 
I TALKED TO ONE OF THEM THIS 
WEEK, HE WAS IN THE AIR FORCE 
IN CAPTIVITY FOR ALMOST 6 YEARS 
AS WELL. 
AND HE TALKED ABOUT SEEING 
McCAIN, EVERY TIME HE SAW HIM 
ON TV HE WOULD STOP AND WATCH 
HIM AND HE SAID HE NEVER FORGOT 
US. 
ALL THE PEOPLE THAT HAD BEEN 
WITH HIM. 
AND THEY ARE PAYING HONOR TO 
HIM TODAY. 
>> AMONG THAT GROUP, EDWARD 
ALVAREZ WHO WAS THE FIRST 
PRISONER OF WAR. 
HE WAS THE LONGEST IN PRISON 
THERE. 
WHAT A REMARKABLE -- 
>> YOU'RE WATCHING NOW WIDOW 
CINDY McCAIN WALK WITH A NUMBER 
OF TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
OFFICIALS SURROUNDING HER 
THERE, YOU SEE SECRETARY OF 
DEFENSE JIM MATUS AT HER SIDE, 
AND ANOTHER MARINE,  A CHIEF OF 
STAFF TO PRESIDENT. 
TRUMP , GENERAL. 
JOHN KELLY WALKING BESIDE HER.  
KELLY WAS ALSO A FRIEND AS WAS 
JIM MATUS. 
SURROUNDED THERE AS WELL BY ALL 
OF HIS CHILDREN. 
THE HISTORY OF SERVICE, THAT 
TIES HEIGHT OF THE TIES TO THE 
MILITARY -- THEY ARE -- THE 
TIES TO THE MILITARY, SENATOR. 
McCAIN WAS ALSO IN  -- OFTEN 
CREDITED WITH VISITING 
BATTLEFIELD UP UNTIL THE VERY 
END. 
I REMEMBER HE CROSSED INTO THE 
BATTLEFIELD IN SYRIA OF ALL THE 
PLACES, I THINK HE WAS ONE OF 
THE VERY FIRST OF VISUALS TO 
CONSIDER DOING THAT. 
HIS AGE DID NOT GIVE HIM ANY 
KIND OF PAUSE. 
>> I REMEMBER ASKING HIM ONCE 
ON FACE THE NATION WHEN HE WAS 
IN KIEV OR SOMEPLACE AND I SAID 
AREN'T YOU PUTTING YOUR LIFE IN 
DANGER AND HE JUST STARTED 
LAUGHING. 
HE SAID BOB, I WILL DIE IN BED. 
I'M GOING TO DIE IN BED. 
>> AND ON PLANE FLIGHTS HE USED 
TO DO THAT, TOO. 
WHEN YOU CAMPAIGNED WITH HIM HE 
NEVER WOULD FLY AROUND WEATHER 
AND CAMPAIGN PLANES HE WOULD 
ALWAYS SAY DON'T WORRY ABOUT 
IT, I'VE CRASHED IN PLANES 
MYSELF. 
THREE I THINK. 
WE ARE GOING TO BE OKAY. 
McCAIN'S DON'T GO OUT AND PLANE 
CRASHES. 
HE HAD THAT FATALISM TO HIM. 
AND HE WANTED TO GO, LINDSEY 
GRAHAM TALKED ABOUT THIS THIS 
WEEK. 
HE WANTED TO GO AND SPEAK FACE-
TO-FACE WITH THE GENERALS AND 
THE PEOPLE UP AND DOWN THE RANK.
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THAT WAS THE 
ONLY WAY YOU CAN REALLY FIGURE 
OUT WHAT WAS TRULY GOING ON. 
>> IT'S LIKE, WE WERE TALKING 
ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY, IT'S LIKE 
WE ALL KNOW IN THE BUSINESS WHO 
DOES THEIR OWN WORK. 
WHO DOES THEIR OWN REPORTING. 
WHO DEPENDS ON OTHERS TO DO 
THAT FOR YOU. 
JOHN McCAIN DID HIS OWN WORK. 
HE DID HIS OWN REPORTING. 
HE WENT, HE SAW, HE TALKED TO 
THE PEOPLE INVOLVED. 
AND THEN HE CAME BACK AND 
REPORTED. 
>> I WANT TO UNDERSCORE THE 
IMPORTANCE AS WELL OF 
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT BOTH THE 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE AND THE 
CHIEF OF STAFF TO PRESIDENT. 
TRUMP ARE THERE WITH CINDY 
McCAIN TODAY.  
OF COURSE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT 
DEEP DIVIDE, BETWEEN THE 
PRESIDENT AND SENATOR. 
McCAIN, IT WAS THAT MOMENT  
THAT COMES TO SO MANY WHERE THE 
PRESIDENT SAID HE DIDN'T 
RESPECT McCAIN. LET'S PAUSE FOR 
A MOMENT AS CINDY SAYS HER 
PRAYER. 
>>>
AND TRAILING BEHIND CINDY 
McCAIN, ALONG WITH CHIEF OF 
STAFF KELLY AND GENERAL MATUS, 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, ARE THE 
OTHER MEMBERS OF THE McCAIN 
FAMILY. 
AS YOU CAN SEE, HIS SON JACK 
AND HIS NAVY WHITES. 
HE IS AN ACTIVE-DUTY NAVAL 
OFFICER. 
HIS SON JIMMY AS WELL IS THERE 
WHO IS WEARING AN ARMY UNIFORM. 
HE STARTED AS A MARINE AND 
CONTINUES IN HIS SERVICE NOW AS 
AN ARMY OFFICER. 
THAT TRADITION REALLY DOES 
CONTINUE. 
TO PICK UP ON WHERE WE LEFT OFF,
PRESIDENT. 
TRUMP HAS BEEN  AN ADVOCATE HE 
SAID FOR THE VETERANS COMMUNITY,
WHICH IS WHY IT REALLY WAS SUCH 
A SHOCKING STATEMENT WHEN HE 
QUESTIONED SENATOR. 
McCAIN'S SERVICE.  
IN 2015. 
>> AND OF COURSE WE ALL 
REMEMBER WILL THINKING THAT IS 
INTERESTING FROM DONALD TRUMP, 
HE'LL BE OVER WITHIN A FEW DAYS 
BUT I THINK A REALIZATION FOR 
SO MANY INVOLVED IN AMERICAN 
POLITICS, WE WERE IN A 
DIFFERENT SPACE. 
AND EVER SINCE OF COURSE THEY 
HAVE BEEN AT ODDS ON JUST ABOUT 
EVERYTHING. 
NO SURPRISE, IT CONTINUED THIS 
WEEK, I SPOKE TO SOMEONE CLOSE 
TO THE FAMILY WHO SAID THAT 
THEY IN NO WAY WERE IN CONTACT 
WITH THE WHITE HOUSE THIS WEEK, 
THEY CONVEYED CONCERNS ABOUT 
HOW THE PRESIDENT COMPORTED 
HIMSELF LAST WEEK ESPECIALLY. 
BUT HAVING THE CHIEF OF STAFF 
AND SECRETARY OF DEFENSE THERE 
IS CERTAINLY A SIGN OF RESPECT 
THAT THE SENATOR DESERVES. 
>> WE MIGHT WANT TO POINT OUT 
TO PEOPLE THAT THESE OTHER 
MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY ARE NOT 
AS INITIATED. 
ANDREW McCAIN, THE TALLER 
GENTLEMAN WITH OUR CARE IS 
DOUGLAS McCAIN THE OTHER SON 
FROM THE FIRST MARRIAGE. 
BRIDGET McCAIN IS CINDY AND THE 
SENATORS ADOPTED DAUGHTER. 
THERE IS A WOMAN, SIDNEY McCAIN 
WHO IS A DAUGHTER FROM HIS 
FIRST MARRIAGE TO HIS FIRST 
WIFE CAROL. 
THEY HAVE ALL BEEN THERE 
THROUGHOUT THE WEEK. 
>> WE HEAR AROUND OF APPLAUSE 
THERE. 
AS THE PEOPLE GATHER TO WATCH 
THE McCAIN FAMILY WALK AWAY 
FROM THE MEMORIAL. 
AND THIS IS A PUBLIC MEMORIAL 
THAT ANYONE VISITING WASHINGTON 
CAN GO TO THE MALL AND VISIT 
FOR THEMSELVES AND SEE THESE 
CLOUDS -- CROWDS OF ONLOOKERS 
TURNING ON THIS MORNING -- 
TURNING OUT THIS MORNING TO PAY 
THEIR RESPECTS. 
>> YOU WERE TALKING MARGARET 
ABOUT HOW JOHN USED TO GO DOWN 
THERE BY HIMSELF, HE WOULD JUST 
GO, IT WAS NOT A PHOTO OP OR 
ANYTHING LIKE THAT. 
THAT WAS SO MUCH JOHN McCAIN. 
HE USED TO DO THE SAME ABOUT 
GOING UP TO WALTER REED. 
WHERE ALL OF THE WAR WOUNDED 
WERE. 
HE DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY HE WAS 
GOING. 
HE CALLED ME UP ONE DAY AND SET 
I'M GOING TO GO OUT THERE, DO 
YOU WANT TO GO WITH ME? 
I KNEW IT WASN'T TO DO A NEW 
STORY OR ANYTHING, HE JUST 
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I SAW 
WHAT WAS OUT THERE. 
HE WOULD JUST GO AND HE DID 
THAT A LOT, IT WAS NOT JUST 
EVERY ONCE AND A WHILE, HE JUST 
FELT IT WAS PART OF HIS DUTY TO 
GO OUT THERE AND CHECK ON THE 
GUYS AND SEE HOW THEY WERE. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT AND HE SAW THAT 
AS BOTH IN KEEPING WITH HIS 
MILITARY SERVICE, THAT YOUR 
SERVICE DOESN'T BEGIN AND END 
WITH THE BEGINNING AND ENDING 
UP WHEN YOU'RE ACTIVE, THAT YOU 
ARE THE STUDENT OR -- STEWARD 
OF A LONG MILITARY TRADITION. 
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT MOE UDALL, 
McCAIN USED TO VISIT HIM, WHO 
TUTORED HIM IN WHAT 
BIPARTISANSHIP WAS. 
THAT YOU SHARED MORE AS 
AMERICANS THAN AS POLITICAL 
OPPONENTS FROM DIFFERENT 
PARTIES AND HE WENT TO GO VISIT 
MOE UDALL WHEN HE WAS IN THE 
VETERANS HOSPITAL WITH 
PARKINSON'S, WHEN LONG AFTER HE 
LEFT THE HOUSE, BECAUSE HE WAS 
STILL ATTENDING THAT 
RELATIONSHIP. 
HE SAW THE STEWARDSHIP THAT WAS 
REQUIRED AND BY JUST SIMPLE 
FRIENDSHIP, NOT THE STEWARDSHIP 
REQUIRED WHEN YOU ARE IN THE 
SERVICE BUT THE THINGS THAT LIFE
, LIFE IS LONG AND THERE ARE 
THINGS THAT ARE WORTH PAYING 
ATTENTION TO EVEN IF THEY GET 
YOU NOTHING POLITICALLY. 
BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT BEING AN 
HONORABLE PERSON IS ABOUT. 
>> DESPITE THAT, THE STATEMENT 
THAT THEN CANDIDATE DONALD 
TRUMP MADE ABOUT SENATOR. 
McCAIN'S SERVICE,  I PREFER 
THOSE WHO WEREN'T CAPTURED, THE 
SENATOR NEVER ASKED FOR AN 
APOLOGY. 
IF ANYTHING HE SAID HE THOUGHT 
THAT VETERANS HEARD IT AND KNEW 
WHAT IT WAS. 
HE SAW IT AS AN OFFENSE TO 
OTHER VETERANS WHO HAD BEEN 
CAPTURED AND KILLED. 
>> AND ACTIVE-DUTY. 
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE GOD FOR BID 
IN THE SERVICE AND CAPTURED, 
WHAT SUSTAINS YOU IS THAT 
EVERYBODY BACK HOME THINKS YOU 
ARE A HERO AND THINKS YOU WERE 
CAPTURED IN THE SERVICE OF YOUR 
COUNTRY MAINTAINING ALL THOSE 
IDEALS THAT WE PUT AT THE 
CENTER OF OUR PUBLIC LIFE. 
AND THAT TENDING THOSE AT HOME 
IS PART OF AN AMERICAN DUTY. 
SO TO SUGGEST THAT THEY ARE 
SOMEHOW LESSER IS AN OFFENSE 
NOT JUST TO JOHN McCAIN BUT TO 
EVERYBODY WHO IS SERVING 
PRESENTLY AND HAS. 
AND I'M NOT JUST MAKING THAT UP.
THIS IS WHAT POWS THAT I TALKED 
TO HAVE SAID AND MEMBERS OF THE 
MILITARY, THEY HAVE SAID THAT 
WAS THEIR REACTION TO THEIR 
REMARKS. 
>> IS THAT -- IF THAT IS HOW 
YOU FELT ABOUT THOSE WHO WERE 
CAPTURED, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT 
THOSE WHO WERE KILLED? 
I MEAN THE LOGIC OF TRYING TO 
SORT ALL OF THAT OUT IS, BUT 
THIS TODAY IS ABOUT JOHN 
McCAIN. 
>> EXACTLY. 
WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT. 
>> YES . 
>> WE WANT TO GO TO ONE OF 
THOSE VETERANS DOWN THERE AT 
THE MEMORIAL AND TO CBS 
CORRESPONDENT MULLEN LANGI, 
>> Reporter: I AM JOINED BY A 
VIETNAM VETERAN WHO CAME OUT TO 
PAY RESPECTS TO THE SENATOR AND 
HIS FAMILY, GOOD MORNING MR. 
STERLING. 
WHY DID YOU COME OUT TODAY? 
>> FIRST OF ALL I BELIEVE THAT 
SENATOR. 
McCAIN  WAS DEFINITELY A HERO 
TO OUR COUNTRY. 
>> Reporter: WHAT DID YOU THINK 
OF THE EVENT AND THE MEMORIAL 
OUT HERE? 
>> I THINK IT WAS REAL QUICK, 
AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEEN A 
LITTLE MORE. 
BUT IT'S NOT WHAT I WANT, IT'S 
MAYBE WHAT THE PUBLIC WANTS, 
BUT ALSO THE MISSES AS WELL. 
>> Reporter: YOU CALL THE LATE 
SENATOR. 
A HERO, HE WAS ONE TOO OFTEN 
SAY HE WAS NOT A HERO, THAT HE 
SERVED IN THE COMPANY OF HEROES 
BUT HE DENIES  THE IDEA THAT HE 
WAS A HERO. 
>> AND THAT'S WHY LIKE HIM. 
HE DENIES THE FACT, HE'S NOT A 
NARCISSISTIC INDIVIDUAL. 
HE WAS A PERSON OF TRUE, WHAT 
YOU SEE OF McCAIN IS McCAIN. 
>> Reporter: WHAT DOES THE LATE 
SENATOR. 
MEAN  TO NONVETERANS, WHAT DOES 
IT MEAN TO VETERANS IN THE 
MILITARY? 
>> THERE IS A LOT OF SEX PRICES 
AND THIS MAN SACRIFICED IT MUCH 
MORE THAN MANY OF US DO. 
WHEN I SEE THAT AND KNOW THAT 
HE WAS AN INSTRUMENTAL LEADER 
FOR PRISONERS OF WAR I FEEL 
THAT HE WAS, SHOW THE STRENGTH 
THAT THIS NATION IS ALL ABOUT. 
>> Reporter: MR. STERLING, 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND 
FOR STOPPING BY. 
>> ONE TAKE BUT ALL SERIOUSLY 
-- OBVIOUSLY A PERSPECTIVE THAT 
MANY VETERANS 
TAKE. 
AND I DON'T TAKE IT WAS BY 
ACCIDENT THAT THE SENATOR KNEW 
ALL OF US HERE ON NETWORKS 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY WOULD BE 
SHOWING THAT SHOT OF ALL OF 
THOSE NAMES. 
%-ú 
WREATH SAYING TO ALL OF THOSE 
WHO HAVE SERVED. 
THAT WAS NOT SENATOR. 
McCAIN'S NAME ON THAT READS, 
THAT WAS EVERYONE.  
IN THAT CONFLICT. 
SO IT WAS A VERY DELIBERATE 
CHOICE, AND THEY ARE MOVING OUT 
TO THE NATIONAL CATHEDRAL TO 
BEGIN THE SERVICE, THE FORMAL 
SERVICE HONORING THE LIFE OF 
SENATOR. 
McCAIN.  
AND YOU CAN SEE INSIDE THAT 
CATHEDRAL, THE EPISCOPAL 
CATHEDRAL, I THINK IT IS THE 
ONLY CATHEDRAL THAT WAS 
ESTABLISHED BY AN ACT OF 
CONGRESS IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN. 
AND THAT SERVICE, THEY CAN SEAT 
SOMETHING LIKE 
4000 PEOPLE INSIDE OF IT. 
YOU WOULD THINK THAT THOSE PEWS 
ARE GOING TO BE PACKED TODAY. 
SO MANY WANTED TO COME OUT. 
>> IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL. 
THERE IS NO BETTER PLACE TO 
HAVE A FUNERAL THAN THE 
NATIONAL CATHEDRAL. 
WELL, LOOK AT THE PICTURES. 
IT IS STUNNING. 
>> IN ANY EVENT, IT -- AND ANY 
EVENT THAT DRAWS THE LIKES OF 
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT AND JAY LENO 
IS GOING TO BE A STELLAR EVENT. 
OF COURSE GEORGE W. BUSH AND 
BARACK OBAMA WILLS THE, BILL 
CLINTON AND HILLARY CLINTON 
FRESH OFF OF ARETHA FRANKLIN'S 
FUNERAL YESTERDAY ARE HERE 
TODAY, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT 
CHENEY, GABBY GIFFORDS OF 
COURSE, THE FORMER 
CONGRESSWOMAN FROM ARIZONA. 
AND AN ARRAY OF FORMER -- 
FOREIGN DIGNITARIES. 
>> TOP DIPLOMATS FROM A NUMBER 
OF ARAB COUNTRIES IN 
PARTICULAR, SAUDI ARABIA, QATAR,
YOU TOUCHED ON THIS EARLY 
PERIOD OF THE FOREIGN LEADERS 
THEY ARE FROM COUNTRIES WHO 
FEEL VERY MUCH AT RISK OF 
INVASION OR AGGRESSION BY 
RUSSIA. 
SENATOR. 
McCAIN  REALLY STANDING OUT, 
PART OF HIS LEGACY WAS BEING 
VERY MUCH A FOIL TO VLADIMIR 
PUTIN OF RUSSIA, HE HAS HERE ON 
THIS LIST THE PRESIDENT OF 
UKRAINE, THE AHEAD OF NATO, 
HE'S GOT THE PRESIDENT, THE 
FORMER PRESIDENT OF GEORGIA. 
ALL SMALL COUNTRIES, THAT 
WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE ON THE 
LIST OF WORLD POWERS BUT THOSE 
WHO FELT THAT THEY NEEDED A 
STRONG ALLY AND FOUND ONE IN 
SENATOR. 
McCAIN.  
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 
AND HE DID THIS WHILE HE WAS 
SICK. 
I MEAN REALLY UNTIL HE WENT TO 
ARIZONA FOR TREATMENT, HE WAS 
STILL FLINGING HIMSELF ACROSS 
THE GLOBE TO TELL LITTLE 
COUNTRIES AND PEOPLE, KEEP THE 
FAITH. 
AMERICA WON'T FORGET YOU.
SOMETHING LIKE NATO, FOR ME, 
NATO, THE SENATE AND HIS 
MILITARY CAREER ARE ALL THE 
PIECE, YOU HAVE THESE 
AGREEMENTS AND INSTITUTIONS, 
THESE ALLIANCES THAT YOU TEND 
BECAUSE IT IS NOT ALWAYS 
WONDERFUL IN THE WORLD. 
AND YOU NEED YOUR FRIENDS IN 
MOMENTS OF CRISIS. 
AND YOU NEED A BEACON FOR SMALL 
COUNTRIES UNDER OPPRESSION TO 
BE ABLE TO LOOK TO A BEACON AND 
SAY PERHAPS WE CAN GET THEIR 
ASSISTANCE. 
THERE IS SOMEBODY OUT THERE WHO 
IS ON OUR SIDE. 
AND IF YOU DON'T ATTEND THOSE 
FIRES, IF YOU DON'T KEEP THOSE 
ALLIANCES AND KEEP THE 
STRUCTURES, THOSE PEOPLE IN 
FARAWAY PLACES LOSE FAITH. 
>> IT IS A LINE OF DEFENSE THAT 
THE SENATOR 
FELT THAT THE UNITED STATES WAS 
WEAKENING ON. 
WHICH IS WHY HE FELT SO 
STRONGLY ABOUT DEFENDING IT IN 
THE PAST FEW YEARS. 
>> AND HE NEVER APOLOGIZED FOR 
THE UNITED STATES PLAYING A 
MAJOR ROLE IN THE WORLD. 
>> THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF 
GEORGIA SAID HE GOT A CALL FROM 
JOHN McCAIN WHEN -- AND HE SAID 
JUST SAY YOU WON'T SURRENDER. 
AND HE THOUGHT WHAT IS THAT? 
PEOPLE LIKE TO STAND WITH 
PEOPLE WHO WANT SURRENDER, JUST 
BE LIKE CHURCHILL. 
>> AND THERE IS FORMER HOUSE 
SPEAKER JOHN WEINER, THERE IS 
CURRENT SPEAKER PAUL RYAN. 
>> LOTS OF INTERESTING 
CONVERSATIONS TODAY.
>> THERE IS OUR HUNT OF THE 
WALL STREET JOURNAL, 
>> LINDSEY GRAHAM TOLD THE 
STORY OF JUST WHAT YOU WERE 
SAYING, McCAIN AND GRAHAM WERE 
ON THE ROAD SOMEWHERE AND HE 
COULDN'T REMEMBER WHAT COUNTRY 
THEY WERE IN BUT McCAIN 
REVENUES WERE ART ABOUT IN AGES 
AND COUNTRY AND WHICH 500 
PEOPLE HAD BEEN HIDE UP BUT 
McCAIN READ AN ARTICLE ABOUT AN 
ATCHISON COUNTRY AND WHICH 500 
PEOPLE HAD BEEN KILLED -- 
McCAIN READ AN ARTICLE ABOUT AN 
ATCHISON COUNTRY WHERE 500 
PEOPLE HAD BEEN KILLED AND HE 
ASKED LINDSEY GRAHAM IF HE 
WANTED TO GO THERE AND LINDSAY 
SAID WHAT YOU WANT TO BE 501 
AND 502? 
>> ONE POLITICAL PRISONER IN 
EGYPT SAID HE HAD NEVER BEEN A 
REPUBLICAN, HE HAD NEVER 
SUPPORTED A 
REPUBLICAN AND HE SAW McCAIN'S 
NAME IN PRINT, HE HEARD A 
SENATOR STAND UP AND SAY HIS 
NAME AND HE SAID WITHOUT THAT I 
WOULD PROBABLY STILL BE IN JAIL.
AND WHO WILL THAT VOICE BE NOW? 
BECAUSE AS WE SAY IT WASN'T 
JUST ABOUT THE FENCE, IT WAS 
DEFENDING AMERICAN VALUES AND 
THAT WAS THE QUESTION FROM SO 
MANY ABOUT SO MANY OF THESE 
ELECTED LEADERS WHO ARE 
GATHERED AT THE CATHEDRAL, WHO 
STEPS UP INTO THAT ROLE? 
IN SOME WAYS THAT IS THE 
QUESTION, IS THAT THE CHALLENGE 
THAT HE IS PUTTING FORTH HERE? 
>> GIVE ME A WEEK AND I'LL COME 
UP WITH A LIST. 
>> YOU'D BETTER HAVE ONE READY 
AT HAND. 
>> I DON'T THINK THAT WILL EVER 
BE ANOTHER JOHN McCAIN BUT WHO 
WILL BECOME THE CONSCIENCE OF 
THE SENATE? 
>> IS A TEST.
THESE FIVE DAYS HAVE BEEN A TEST
WHICH IS THAT ALL OF THESE 
CHARACTERISTICS THAT HAVE BEEN 
LAUDED BY THESE PEOPLE 
CONTINUOUSLY. 
AND SO OFTEN WHEN YOU HEAR THAT 
YOU SAY OKAY, WHO'S GOING TO 
STEP UP. 
AND IF YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE 
PEOPLE, WHAT OF JOHN McCAIN DO 
YOU SEE IN YOURSELF? 
THAT IS WHAT SENATOR.  
GRAHAM WAS TALKING ABOUT. 
EVERY MEMBER SAYS THAT FOR 
WHATEVER THEIR CAUSE IS, CAN 
THEY PASS THE TEST? 
CAN THEY PASS THE TEST OF 
WHETHER THEY KEPT THEIR VALUES 
AND DIDN'T JUST TALK ABOUT IT 
BUT ACTED ON IT? 
>> THERE MAY BE TWO SENATORS 
WHO ARE CLOSE TO McCAIN, WHO 
CAN FILL SOME OF THE VOID. 
CERTAINLY LINDSEY GRAHAM WHEN 
IT COMES TO NATIONAL SECURITY 
ISSUES AND REPRESENTING THE 
COUNTRY OVERSEAS BUT I THINK 
SUSAN COLLINS IS ANOTHER ONE 
WHO ESPECIALLY THIS YEAR HAS 
SERVED AS A MEDIATOR BETWEEN 
THE PARTIES. 
>> REPUBLICAN SENATOR. 
FROM MAINE.  
>> YES, SOMEONE WHO IS QUITE 
CLOSE TO HIM AND WHO HAS LENT 
HER OFFICE TO SOME PRETTY 
SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS THIS YEAR, 
ISSUES THAT NEEDED TO BE 
ADDRESSED AND IN SOME WAYS SHE 
WAS FILLING A VOID THAT McCAIN 
WOULD HAVE BEEN FILLING HAD HE 
BEEN THERE. 
>> WE ALSO SAW IN THAT LAST 
SHOT, DAN COATS, THE GOVERNOR 
OF OHIO JUNK ASIC AS WELL WHO 
SERVED -- JOHN K SICK, ON 
WEEKENDS 
IN WASHINGTON, PARTICULARLY ON 
LABOR DAY, YOU DO NOT SEE 
ELECTED OFFICIALS HERE IN THE 
NATION'S CAPITAL. 
THEY HAVE ALL STUCK AROUND 
BECAUSE THEY ALL WANTED TO BE 
HERE TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS. 
AND THIS FINAL PUBLIC DAY OF 
CELEBRATION, YOU SEE THE 
PRESIDENT'S DAUGHTER IF ANKE 
TRUMP, COUNSELOR TO THE 
PRESIDENT AND ANOTHER TOP 
ADVISOR JARED KUSHNER THERE 
HOLDING HER HAND. 
SO THE TRUMP FAMILY, NOT JUST 
THE TRUMPET MINISTRATION IS 
BEING REPRESENTED TODAY, WE NO 
THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF 
DELIBERATELY NOT PART OF THE 
SERVICES. 
>> HE WASN'T INVITED. 
TO BE FAIR. 
HE WASN'T INVITED. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 
WHEN I SAY DELIBERATE I MEAN ON 
BEHALF OF THE McCAIN FAMILY. 
AND THAT GOES TO A SERIES OF 
DISAGREEMENTS, DISPUTES, OVER 
THE PAST FEW YEARS. 
AND REALLY WE DON'T WANT TO 
MAKE THIS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. 
THIS IS ABOUT SENATOR. 
McCAIN BUT SENATOR. 
McCAIN'S  LAST BOOK RESTLESS 
WAVE WAS LARGELY ABOUT WHAT HE 
SAW HAPPENING IN THIS COUNTRY 
ú 
ABOUT PRESIDENT. 
TRUMP  AND SOME OF THE FORCES 
THAT HE SAW HIM REPRESENTATIVE 
OF. 
A SYMPTOM REALLY IS WHAT HE 
DESCRIBED HIM AS, OF SOME OF 
THE FRUSTRATIONS HE HAD.
HE REALLY WAS FRUSTRATED WITH 
THE DIRECTION OF THE COUNTRY 
AND SOME ARE SAYING THAT MAYBE 
TODAY THIS ORCHESTRATION OF 
BIPARTISANSHIP IS HIS 
COUNTERPOINT TO THAT. 
>> IT 
WILL BE INTERESTING TO HEAR, WE 
SAW SOME OF THIS IN ARIZONA AT 
THE SERVICE FOR HIM THERE, FROM 
FORMER VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN,  
THE EXTENT TO WHICH PRESIDENT. 
OBAMA AND PRESIDENT.  
BUSH SPEAK TO THAT OR DO THEY 
KEEP THIS JUST ABOUT JOHN 
McCAIN. 
AGAIN, JOHN McCAIN IS A SYMBOL 
OF SOMETHING AND WHAT IS HE A 
SYMBOL OF? 
AND WHAT DO WE DO WITH THAT? 
DO WE JUST SAY THIS IS NICE OR 
IS THAT A BEACON THAT AMERICANS 
AND ALL OF US ENGAGED IN PUBLIC 
LIFE HAVE TO MOVE TOWARD. 
>> LET'S PUT THAT QUESTION TO 
NANCY CORDIS, WHO IS 
ACCOMPANIED BY SENATOR. 
JEFF FLAKE OF ARIZONA.  
>> Reporter: SENATOR. 
FLAKE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR 
JOINING US TODAY,  YOU HAVE 
BEEN SUCH AN INTEGRAL PART OF 
ALL OF THESE MEMORIAL SERVICES 
THIS WEEK AND SO I GUESS I WILL 
START BY ASKING YOU WHAT HAS 
STRUCK YOU MOST ABOUT THE 
OUTPOURING WE HAVE SEEN FROM 
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE, FROM 
PUBLIC OFFICIALS TO PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE NEVER MET THE SENATOR.  
>> WE ARE NOT SURPRISED AT THE 
OUTPOURING FROM HIS COLLEAGUES. 
EVERYBODY LOVED JOHN. 
ON EITHER SIDE OF THE AISLE, 
WHETHER THEY AGREED WITH HIM 
ALWAYS OR NOT. 
BUT WHAT HAS JUST BEEN 
COMPLETELY MIND BLOWING IS THE 
REACTION ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 
IT IS AS IF THEY ARE WANTING TO 
REMEMBER POLITICS THIS WAY. 
WHEN PEOPLE SAW THE HUMANITY ON 
THE OTHER SIDE AND I THINK THAT 
IS WHY THIS WEEK HAS BEEN SO 
SPECIAL. 
I THINK IT HAS BLOWN US ALL 
AWAY WITH THE REACTION. 
>> Reporter: HE WAS IN SO MANY 
WAYS AN INSPIRATION TO YOU WHEN 
YOU CAME TO THE SENATE SIX 
YEARS AGO, PROBABLY EVEN BEFORE 
THAT BUT DO YOU THINK SOMEONE 
LIKE JOHN McCAIN WITH HIS 
POLITICAL PROFILE, VERY 
CONSERVATIVE ON SOME ISSUES BUT 
WILLING TO WORK ON OTHER 
ISSUES, COULD GET IN -- COULD 
GET ELECTED IN ARIZONA RIGHT 
NOW? 
>> NOT RIGHT NOW. 
IT WON'T ALWAYS BE THIS WAY BUT 
RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO POLITICAL 
REWARD FOR DOING WHAT JOHN 
McCAIN DID, REACHING ACROSS THE 
AISLE. 
AND NOT DEMONIZING THE OTHER 
SIDE. 
ALL THE INCENTIVES ARE WRONG BY 
NOW. 
BUT IT WON'T ALWAYS BE THAT 
WAY. 
ANGER AND RESENTMENT ARE NOT A 
GOVERNING PHILOSOPHY. 
SOONER OR LATER THE VOTERS WILL 
AGAIN VALUE SOMEBODY LIKE JOHN 
McCAIN. 
WHO STANDS ON PRINCIPLE BUT 
UNDERSTANDS THAT YOU NEED TO 
WORK WITH THE OTHER SIDE, 
SOMEBODY WHO CAN FORGIVE HIS 
VIETNAM TORMENTORS AND 
TORTURERS, I THINK THAT TELLS 
US WE CAN CERTAINLY FORGIVE 
EACH OTHER FOR LITTLE OFFENSES. 
AND WORK TOGETHER IN THE 
SENATE. 
>> Reporter: AND YET WE NO -- 
KNOW THAT HE PERSONALLY WAS 
DISAPPOINTED IN THE TENOR OF 
THE GOP PRIMARY AND ARIZONA FOR 
YOUR SEAT BECAUSE YOU ARE 
RETIRING AT THE END OF THIS 
TERM AND HE WAS FRUSTRATED THAT 
THE DEBATE WAS NOT CONDUCTED 
ALONG THE LINES THAT HE FELT WAS
OF THE STANDARD OF SOMEONE WHO 
WANTED TO BE A SENATOR. 
>> IT IS NOT JUST THIS RACE, 
IT'S BEEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 
IT IS DISAPPOINTING BUT IT 
WON'T ALWAYS BE THIS WAY. 
>> Reporter: WHAT GIVES YOU 
THAT FAITH? 
WHAT GIVES YOU THE SENSE THAT 
THIS IS GOING TO CHANGE? 
>> I THINK WE BOTH FELT THIS 
WAY. 
JOHN AND I SAT DOWN A FEW 
MONTHS AGO FOR OVER AN HOUR AND 
TALKED ABOUT ARIZONA POLITICS 
AND POLITICIANS COME AND GONE. 
AND HE TALKED ABOUT HIS 
OPTIMISM THAT PEOPLE WOULD RISE 
UP AGAIN AND THAT THEIR SERVICE 
WOULD BE VALUED. 
PEOPLE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE 
OTHER SIDE. 
WE HAVE NO CHOICE. 
BIG ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO SOLVE
THAT CAN ONLY BE SOLVED IF WE 
REACH ACROSS THE AISLE. 
I THINK THAT IS GOING TO FORCE 
US TOGETHER IF NOTHING ELSE. 
AND I THINK WEEKS LIKE THIS 
TEND TO REMIND PEOPLE WHAT 
REALLY MATTERS. 
AND WHEN YOU SEE THE OUTPOURING 
FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE, I 
THINK MAYBE IT WILL REMIND 
PEOPLE OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO. 
>> Reporter: THANK YOU FOR YOUR 
OPTIMISM, SENATOR. 
JEFF FLAKE OF ARIZONA. 
MARGARET ? 
>> THANK YOU NESTLC -- NANCY 
>> AND HERE IS THE MOTORCADE 
PROCEEDING TO THE NATIONAL 
CATHEDRAL AND THE NATION'S 
CAPITAL. 
WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING WHO IS 
GATHERED TO HONOR SENATOR. 
McCAIN INSIDE THAT CHURCH AS HE 
AND HIS FAMILY  NOW BEGIN TO 
ARRIVE. 
YOU HEARD SENATOR. 
FLAKE  STRIKE AN OPTIMISTIC 
TONE. 
IT'S A HOPEFUL ONE BUT IN MANY 
WAYS WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE 
PAST TWO YEARS IS THIS REVOLT 
AGAINST THE ESTABLISHMENT. 
>> REVOLTING AGAINST THE EXACT 
KIND OF REPUBLICAN THAT JOHN 
McCAIN AND JEFF FLAKE BOTH ARE, 
PUBLICLY SPEAKING OUT AGAINST 
THE PRESIDENT IN BOOKS AND 
SPEECHES, FLAKE ONE OF THE MOST 
HUMBLE KINDEST MEMBERS OF THE 
SENATE. 
I WAS AT A NUCLEAR PLANT IN 
ARIZONA LAST MAY AND HE TOLD 
THIS ROOMFUL OF WORKERS A STORY 
ABOUT BEING THE OTHER SENATOR 
FROM ARIZONA, THAT THEY BOARDED 
A FLIGHT HOME TO PHOENIX 
TOGETHER AND HE SAT DOWN AND 
THIS WOMAN SAID DID YOU SEE 
WHO'S UP FRONT? 
OH MY GOSH, OH MY GOSH JOHN 
McCAIN IS ON THE PLANE. 
AND HE SAID OH, YES HE IS. 
AND THE WOMAN LOOKS AT HIM AND 
SAYS WHERE HAVE I SEEN YOU? 
AND THE MAN IN FRONT OF THE TWO 
PEOPLE, IN FRONT OF THE 
SENATOR. 
AND THE WOMAN SAYS  HEY LADY, 
THAT IS YOUR OTHER SENATOR FROM 
ARIZONA, THAT'S WHY HE LOOKS SO 
FAMILIAR. 
SO HE KNEW HIS PLACE. 
>> THE OTHER SENATOR. 
>> YES, HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF 
TO BE THE OTHER SENATOR FROM 
ARIZONA. 
>> AS NANCY ALLUDED TO IN OUR 
CONVERSATION, BOTH OF THE SEATS 
HAVE BEEN OPENED. 
>> THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE 
PRESIDENT, WE ARE GOING TO SEE 
STARTING NEXT WEEK A SUPREME 
COURT NOMINEE THAT WILL 
ENCOURAGE ALL OF THE PEOPLE IN 
THE SENATE TO REVERT TO THAT 
STRUCTURE THAT SENATOR. 
FLAKE WAS TALKING ABOUT,  THAT 
ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO BEHAVE IN 
A WAY THAT IS NOT BIPARTISAN. 
AND THAT IS WHY JOHN McCAIN, 
WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT REGULAR 
ORDER, AND I KNOW ABOUT THIS 
FROM COVERING THE SENATE, WHAT 
IS REGULAR ORDER, IT'S A SYSTEM 
OF DOING THINGS. 
A STRUCTURE THAT FORCES PEOPLE 
TO COMPROMISE. 
WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY THAT 
STRUCTURE AND EVERYBODY HAS 
THEIR SELF INTEREST NOT TO 
COMPROMISE, THE SYSTEM DOESN'T 
FORCE YOU TO GET IN THE MIDDLE. 
A FORMER COLLEAGUE OF MINE 
DAVID PLOTZ DESCRIBED, TALK TO 
McCAIN ABOUT BOXING ONE TIME. 
BOXING IS FIGHTING BUT THERE 
ARE RULES. 
YOU DON'T HIT BELOW THE BELT, 
YOU DON'T KICK THE GUY IN THE 
SHINS AND HE THOUGHT THAT WAS A 
NICE METAPHOR FOR THE WAY JOHN 
McCAIN BELIEVED YOU SHOULD KEEP 
THE RULES. 
SO THAT YOU CAN THEN HAVE A 
REALLY GOOD FIGHT AND AT THE 
END OF THE FIGHT TO FIGURE 
SOMETHING OUT. 
THAT IS WHY HE WAS SO FOCUSED 
ON THE ORDER OF THINGS, BECAUSE 
THE ORDER IS WHAT ALLOWS THE 
COMPROMISE TO HAPPEN. 
>> IN LATE 2012 THERE WAS A 
PROPOSAL AMONG SENATORS TO 
FILIBUSTER, AND HE SAID OF A 
SENATOR WANTS TO BLOCK 
LEGISLATION HE OR SHE SHOULD GO 
TO THE FLOOR AND VOICE THEIR 
OBJECTION. 
IT WASN'T THAT YOU WERE GOING 
TO WIN THE FIGHT BUT AT LEAST 
YOU WOULD HAVE THE CONVERSATION 
AND IF IT DIDN'T GO THAT WAY SO 
BE IT. 
>> THAT OF COURSE WAS PART OF 
THE FRUSTRATION THAT HE VOICED 
AROUND HIS DECISION TO VOTE, 
THE THUMBS DOWN IN THE MIDDLE 
OF THE NIGHT, ON THE 
PRESIDENT'S ATTEMPT TO REPEAL 
WHAT IS OFTEN CALLED OBAMA CARE.
THAT THERE WASN'T REGULAR 
ORDER, THERE WAS IN THE PROCESS,
THERE WASN'T AN ACTUAL 
CONVERSATION TO BE HAD. 
TO TALK THROUGH A VERY 
SIGNIFICANT DECISION THAT HE 
FELT WAS BEING MADE. 
>> BUT JOHN McCAIN, JOE BIDEN, 
THE PEOPLE FROM THAT PARTICULAR 
GENERATION, THEY COULD GO OUT 
THERE AND HAVE A KNOCKDOWN DRAG 
OUT AND THEN WALK OFF THE 
SENATE FLOOR AND LEAVE ALL THE 
BAD RHETORIC AND STUFF ON THE 
SENATE FLOOR. 
McCAIN HIMSELF WOULD TELL ABOUT 
WHEN HE AND KENNEDY, TED 
KENNEDY, WOULD GO AT IT AND HE 
SAID ONE DAY WE JUST RAN THESE 
TWO FRESHMEN OFF THAT HAD 
STARTED THE DEBATE OUT THERE 
AND WE WENT AT IT AND WALKED 
OFF THE FLOOR AND TED PUT HIS 
ARM AROUND ME AND SAID BOY, WE 
REALLY PUT ONE ON FOR THEM 
TODAY, DIDN'T WE JOHN? 
AND THAT WAS WHAT YOU LIKED AND 
WHAT ATTRACTED YOU TO THE 
PEOPLE OF THAT DAY. 
>> THEY KNEW THAT WHILE THEY 
MIGHT BE FIGHTING LIKE CATS AND 
DOGS TODAY OVER ONE THING 
TOMORROW THEY MIGHT BE WORKING 
ON SOMETHING TOGETHER AND LIFE 
WAS LONG. 
THERE WAS A CONTINUITY AND YOU 
HAD TO RECOGNIZE THAT. 
IT WASN'T ALWAYS ABOUT THE NEXT 
NEWS CYCLE, YOU NEEDED THEM FOR 
LONG CYCLED AHEAD. 
>> RELATIONSHIPS IN THE SENATE 
ARE ALWAYS TRANSACTIONAL. 
YESTERDAY'S OPPONENT IS 
TOMORROW'S MOST CRITICAL ALLY. 
>> YOU HEARD SENATOR. 
McCONNELL YESTERDAY SAY THAT 
McCAIN BROUGHT AN INTENSITY TO 
THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS , I WANT 
TO GO BACK TO THE CATHEDRAL NOW 
TO HEARCBS NEWS NANCY CORDIS 
WHO IS WATCHING THE PROCESSION 
AND THE MOTORCADE AS IT ARRIVES 
THERE AT THE NATIONAL 
CATHEDRAL. 
NANCY, WHO ARE YOU SEEING AND 
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING? 
>> Reporter: A VERY SOLEMN 
SCENE AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE 
CATHEDRAL MARGARET, THE HEARSE 
HAS PULLED UP AS YOU SEE AT THE 
FRONT DOOR, THERE IS A MILITARY 
HONOR GUARD WAITING HERE TO 
REMOVE THE CASKET FROM THE 
HEARSE AND CARRY IT INTO THE 
CATHEDRAL. 
THE GUESTS OF COURSE HAVE 
ALREADY ARRIVED AND HAVE BEEN 
WAITING THIS MOMENT, A MOMENT 
THAT WE HAVE SEEN PLAY OUT 
SEVERAL TIMES THIS WEEK NOW, AT 
A CHURCH IN NORTH PHOENIX, AT 
THE ARIZONA STATE CAPITOL IN 
PHOENIX, SO MUCH RESPECT BEING 
PAID TO THIS MAN WHO WAS NOT 
JUST A SENATOR. 
BUT THE BEARER OF A FAMILY 
LEGACY IN THE U.S. NAVY AND WHO 
LOVED THE MILITARY SO MUCH. 
EVEN AFTER HE SERVED, EVEN 
AFTER HE CAME BACK FROM 
VIETNAM, SERVED AS A NAVY 
LIAISON. 
WHEN HE ENTERED CONGRESS HE WAS 
A MEMBER OF THE SENATE ARMS 
SERVICES COMMITTEE FOR DECADES. 
HE LED IT FOR THE LAST THREE 
YEARS OF HIS LIFE. 
THE MILITARY WAS SO INCREDIBLY 
IMPORTANT TO HIM AS YOU'VE 
HEARD BOB TALKING ABOUT TODAY. 
BUT ALSO, GOVERNMENT WASTE WAS 
IMPORTANT TO HIM AS WELL AND IT 
WAS IMPORTANT TO HIM THAT THE 
MILITARY HAD WHAT IT NEEDED,
BUT ALSO THAT THE MILITARY AND 
OTHER PARTS OF THE GOVERNMENT 
DIDN'T WASTE THE MONEY THAT 
THEY HAD. 
>> WE DON'T WANT TO CANONIZE 
THE SENATOR EITHER. 
>> AND HE WANTED -- HE WOULDN'T 
WANT US TO EITHER. 
>> I HEAR NANCY LAUGHING THERE 
BUT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT, YOU'VE 
HAD A GREAT DESCRIPTOR, YOU SAID
HE HAD SOME SCUFF MARKS ON HIS 
LEGACY AND HE WAS OPEN ABOUT 
THEM. 
>> WHICH IS ITSELF RARE, THAT 
POLITICIANS ADMIT MISTAKES. 
HE SOMETIMES WOULD SAY HERE, 
COME SIT DOWN AND LET ME TELL 
YOU ABOUT ALL OF MY MISTAKES. 
HIS VIEW WAS, AND THAT'S WHAT 
MADE HIS CHARACTER DURABLE, IT 
WAS NOT JUST THIS THING SET OFF 
IN A CASE THAT EVERYONE IS 
SUPPOSED TO ADMIRE. 
IT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN 
OUT THERE AND HAD BEEN BEATEN 
UP. 
IT HAD BEEN FIRST IN THE 5 1/2 
YEARS HE WOULD TELL ABOUT WHERE 
HE LET HIMSELF DOWN AND HIS 
COUNTRY DOWN DURING HIS TIME IN 
CAPTIVITY. 
BUT THEN ON LEGISLATION AND IN 
BATTLES WHEN HE WAS TOO HOT 
TEMPERED OR TWO SHORT TEMPERED 
OR WHEN HE BORE A GRUDGE. 
BUT HE WAS CONSTANTLY TRYING TO 
GET ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THAT, 
TRYING TO GET BACK IN THE 
GROUPS OF THE STANDARD THAT HE 
TRIED TO MAINTAIN. 
AND THAT IS THE HUMAN THING. 
PEOPLE ARE COMPLEX AND HE WAS 
CERTAINLY QUITE COMPLEX AND HE 
WAS ALWAYS LOOKING AT HIS 
COMPLEXITIES AND TRYING TO MAKE 
IT BETTER. 
AND EVEN HIS BLIND SPOTS THAT 
HIS FRIENDS WOULD RECOGNIZE 
THAT HE STILL HAD UNTIL THE 
END. 
THEY WERE ONES THAT HE WOULD 
RECOGNIZE AND THEN MAYBE JUST 
NOT BE ABLE TO FIX BUT THAT WAS 
ABSOLUTELY A KEY PART OF HIS 
CHARACTER. 
>> BUT HE WOULD RARELY GET MAD. 
I MEAN HE ALWAYS LAUGHED ABOUT 
IT LATER BUT THERE'S NO 
QUESTION ABOUT THAT. 
AND HE WOULD SAY THINGS THAT HE 
SHOULD NOT HAVE SAID. 
BUT IN THE HEAT OF BATTLE, BUT 
HE WAS THE FIRST TO SAY I WILL 
NEVER BE ELECTED MS. 
CONGENIALITY OF THE UNITED 
STATES. 
BUT HE MANAGED TO GET BY. 
>> IRA REMEMBER -- I REMOVER 
ONCE SEEING A PROFILE OF HIM 
AND ASKING HIM DID YOU -- DO 
YOU TAKE MEDICATION FOR YOUR 
ANGER AND HE DIDN'T APPRECIATE 
THAT QUESTION. 
BUT HIS COLLEAGUES WHEN HE RAN 
FOR PRESIDENT THAT DIDN'T LIKE 
HIM SAID THAT HE LACKS THE 
TEMPERAMENT TO BE PRESIDENT 
BECAUSE HE GETS INTO THESE 
FIGHTS, HE'S VIOLENT. 
OR NOT VIOLENT, HE'S PASSIONATE.
WHICH LEFT SOME BRUISES. 
>> FOR THOSE WHO ASCRIBE THAT 
TO HIS TIME IN CAPTIVITY, LAST 
WEEKEND WE WERE TALKING TO 
KAREN TOLD T WHO HAD WRITTEN AN 
IN-DEPTH OBITUARY ABOUT JOHN 
McCAIN AND SHE SAID NO, HIS 
MOTHER SAID WHEN HE WAS A 
TODDLER HE WOULD GET SO MAD HE 
WOULD HOLD HIS BREATH UNTIL HE 
PASSED OUT LITERALLY. 
AND THAT THE NAVY DOCTOR TOLD 
HER TO DUMP HIM IN COLD WATER 
TO GET HIM TO STOP. 
HE WAS STUBBORN. 
>> AND REMEMBER, BEING CALLED A 
JERK BY HIM IN THE HALLS OF 
CONGRESS WAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST 
HONORS THAT A CONGRESSIONAL 
MEMBER COULD EARN AND IT 
SOMETIMES MEANT HE WOULDN'T 
TALK TO YOU FOR A FEW DAYS OR 
WEEKS BUT I CAN -- I CAN RECALL 
SOME PEOPLE IN THAT SITUATION. 
>> BUT IN THE OTHER END OF THAT 
HE WAS A GREAT KNEELER. 
HE WAS ALWAYS ASKING ME IF I WAS
-- IF I HAD INVESTIGATED 
ASSISTED LIVING. 
WE WERE THESE TWO OLD GUYS IN 
THE HALLS OF CONGRESS AND 
DURING THAT 2000 CAMPAIGN. 
>> IT LOOKS LIKE JOHN KELLY AND 
JIM MATUS. 
>> I REMEMBER IN THAT CAMPAIGN 
HE WOULD POINT BACK TO US AND 
SAY WILL THAT BUNCH OF 
COMMUNISTS BACK THERE, BUT HE 
WAS KIDDING. 
AND EVERYBODY KNEW HE WAS. 
>> HE REFERRED TO THE STAFFERS 
THAT WORKED FOR HIM, THE BEST 
YOU CAN GET FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE 
OUT ON WORK RELEASE PROGRAMS. 
>>  
>> AND YOU NO, WHILE WE ARE ON 
THE McCAIN HUMOR, I WENT BACK 
WHEN I WAS WRITING ABOUT HIM A 
FEW YEARS AGO AND LISTENED TO 
THE TOWN HALLS AND THEY WOULD 
ALWAYS BEGIN WITH 15 MINUTES OF 
BASICALLY CATSKILL HUMOR, GOING 
BACK TO WHEN HE WAS A 
STORYTELLER IN ILLINOIS -- 
HANOI. 
ENTERTAINING PEOPLE WITH ALL OF 
THAT NEEDLING AND JOKING. 
HE WOULD SAY COME DOWN FRONT 
FOR THE SPEECH AND HE WOULD SAY 
COME ON UP YOU CAN TAKE A NAP 
APPEAR AND WE WON'T DISTURB 
YOU. 
>> HE DIDN'T TO TAKE HIMSELF 
TOO SERIOUSLY.
>> THERE ARE SEVERAL THAT WE 
CAN'T REPEAT. 
>> AND I WANT TO SAY, THIS IS 
THE PUBLIC FUNERAL. 
THERE WILL BE A PRIVATE 
MEMORIAL SERVICE TOMORROW AT 
ANNAPOLIS WHERE THE NAVAL 
ACADEMY IS. 
THE SENATOR ATTENDED IT MANY 
YEARS AGO AS DID HIS FATHER AND 
GRANDFATHER. 
BUT TODAY THIS IS ABOUT 
CELEBRATING HIS LIFE AND HE HAS 
BROUGHT SOME PRETTY 
DISTINGUISHED PEOPLE HERE 
TOGETHER. 
WE KNOW THAT SOME FORMER 
PRESIDENTS OF THIS COUNTRY OF 
COURSE ARE GOING TO BE 
EULOGIZING HIM. 
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 
FOREIGN LEADERS BUT THE TWO MEN 
WHO QUASHED SENATOR. 
McCAIN'S  BIDS TO BECOME 
PRESIDENT HIMSELF, BARACK OBAMA 
AND BEFORE THAT GEORGE W. BUSH, 
ARE THERE AT THE CATHEDRAL AND 
WILL BE DELIVERING EULOGIES. 
WE NO THEY ARE -- WE KNOW THEY 
ARE INSIDE RIGHT NOW. 
WE ARE LOOKING AT IVANKA TRUMP, 
AND JARED KUSHNER, THE 
PRESIDENT'S SON-IN-LAW AND  
DAUGHTER. 
>> AND THEY ARE SPEAKING WITH 
ONE OF HIS CLOSEST PARTNERS, IN 
THE SENATE. 
>> I WAS GOING BACK AND LOOKING 
AT McCAIN'S CONCESSION SPEECH 
WHEN HE LOST IT TO PRESIDENT. 
OBAMA.  
IT IS ALL IN HERE. 
HE TALKS ABOUT RIGHT OFF THE 
TOP, I HAD THE HONOR OF CALLING 
BARACK OBAMA, HE TALKED ABOUT 
THE FACT THAT CANDIDATE OBAMA 
COMMANDED HIS RESPECT FOR HIS 
PERSEVERANCE, HE ADMIRED HIM 
AND COMMENDED HIM. 
THIS IS IN THE FIRST TWO 
PARAGRAPHS. 
RECOGNIZING AFTER A BITTER FIGHT
AND ONE IN WHICH HE EXPRESSED 
AND BEHAVED IN ALL OF THOSE 
WAYS WE WERE JUST TALKING 
ABOUT, THAT VERY POINTED 
BEHAVIOR HE COULD HAVE, BUT 
IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED THAT HIS 
DUTY AS THE DEFEATED WAS TO 
HONOR AND RAISE UP AND COMMEND 
IN PUBLIC THE PERSON WHO HAD 
JUST ONE. 
>> MY PRESIDENT, HE CALLED HIM. 
>> IS RIGHT, HE CALLED IN MY 
PRESIDENT. 
THAT IS VERY MUCH A PART OF 
HIM. 
>> I NOTED, YOU REFERENCED THAT 
CONCESSION SPEECH, ALSO IN THE 
FINAL LETTER THAT THE SENATOR 
RELEASED, AT HIS TIME OF DEATH 
IT HAD ECHOES OF THAT, LITTLE 
QUOTES FROM THAT, THE LAST 
LINE, AMERICANS NEVER QUITS, WE 
NEVER SURRENDER, WE NEVER HIDE 
FROM HISTORY, WE MAKE HISTORY. 
DELIBERATE IN REFERENCING THAT. 
I NO HIS FORMER COLLEAGUE MARK 
SALTER AUTHORED IT. 
>> WE SHOULD MENTION WHAT 
LEADERS DO, THEY PULL OTHER 
PEOPLE ALONG IN THEIR WAKE AND 
IMPRESS THEIR WILL UPON THEM. 
AND MARK SALTER CHANNELED KIND 
OF THE CORE OF JOHN McCAIN, WHO 
BY HIS HAIDA BY THE WAY WHEN 
JOHN McCAIN WAS LEFT TO HIS OWN 
DEVICES -- BY THE WAY WHEN JOHN 
McCAIN WAS LED TO HIS OWN 
DEVICES HE COULDN'T QUITE SELL 
IT BUT MARK SALTER TOOK HIS 
WORDS AND KIND OF SOLIDIFIED 
THE THOUGHT PROCESS. 
>> WE DO APPRECIATE THE FACT 
THAT HE IS HAVING OBAMA AND 
GEORGE W. BUSH SPEAK HERE. 
THOSE CAMPAIGNS, THE 2000 
CAMPAIGN WAS EVEN NASTIER. 
THEN THE ONE WITH OBAMA. 
AND THE FACT THAT HE COULD MOVE 
PAST THAT AND UNDERSTAND THAT 
THAT WAS IN THE PAST AND NOW WE 
ARE IN THE FUTURE. 
>> AND NASTY WITHIN HIS OWN 
PARTY. 
>> YES. 
AND WHEN HE LOST I REMEMBER 
ASKING GEORGE McGOVERN ONCE, DO 
YOU EVER GET OVER GETTING BEAT 
WHEN YOU RUN FOR PRESIDENT AND 
HE SAID NO, YOU NEVER DO. 
HE SAID YOU JUST NEVER GET PAST 
IT. 
McCAIN JUST WENT BACK TO WORK. 
HE GOT OVER IT. 
SURE, IT WOULD ALWAYS BE A PART 
OF HIM BUT HE WENT RIGHT BACK 
TO WORK AND IT WAS ALMOST LIKE 
HIS THERAPY IN SOME WAYS. 
HE DIDN'T MISS A BEAT. 
>> YOU CAN SEE THEIR FORMER 
SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY 
CLINTON INSIDE THE CATHEDRAL AS 
WELL TO PAY HER RESPECTS. 
NANCY CORDIS IS OUTSIDE THE 
CATHEDRAL AND NANCY I WAS 
RECENTLY SPEAKING TO SENATOR. 
TIM KANE,  HILLARY CLINTON'S 
RUNNING MATE IN 2016 WHO SAID 
JUST WHAT BOB WAS REFERENCING 
THERE, THAT AFTER WHAT W■AS A 
BRUISING 2016 CAMPAIGN THAT I 
NO YOU COVERED, THAT IT WAS 
ACTUALLY McCAIN WHO SAID TO 
HIM, THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO, 
JUST GET RIGHT BACK TO WORK. 
DON'T LICK YOUR WOUNDS TOO 
LONG, JUST GET RIGHT BACK TO 
THE WORK IN CONGRESS.
NANCY ARE YOU SEEING THE 
CLINTON FAMILY AS WELL? 
>> Reporter: I SEE THE CLINTON 
FAMILY, I SEE THE OBAMA FAMILY. 
AND I THINK THE FACT THAT JOE 
LIEBERMAN WHO YOU SAW A FEW 
MINUTES AGO WILL BE SPEAKING 
TODAY AS WELL, McCAIN 
CONSIDERED HIM AS A RUNNING 
MATE BACK IN 2008. 
HE HAD TO BE TALKED OUT OF IT 
BY REPUBLICANS WHO SAID YOU 
JUST CAN'T DO THAT, YOU CAN'T 
HAVE A DEMOCRAT AS A RUNNING 
MATE. 
SO HE ACQUIESCED AND LATER SAID 
THAT WAS ONE OF HIS WEIGHT -- 
GREAT REGRETS. 
IF JOHN McCAIN IS TRYING TO 
SEND US ANY MESSAGE, IT IS 
SOMETHING THAT HE SAID ABOUT 
MOE UDALL MANY YEARS AGO. 
HE SAID WE DISAGREE IN POLITICS 
BUT NOT IN LIFE. 
AND IT EVERY MEMORIAL SERVICE 
THIS WEEK, WHETHER IT WAS IN 
ARIZONA, AT THE US CAPITOL, THE 
PEOPLE WHO McCAIN CHOSE TO SPEAK
WHERE PEOPLE WITH WHOM HE 
DISAGREED ON A WHOLE HOST OF 
ISSUES BUT WHO HE LOVED AND 
THEY LOVED HIM ANYWAY. 
AND WHO SHARED HIGHER VALUES. 
AND IT IS A REMINDER THAT IT IS 
NOT JUST ABOUT RIGHT AND LEFT, 
BUT THAT THERE ARE UNIVERSAL 
VALUES THAT WE HAVE ALL SHARED. 
AND I THINK JOHN McCAIN PLANNED 
ALL OF THESE CEREMONIES DOWN TO 
THE FINAL DETAIL, THIS IS 
SOMETHING THAT HE WANTED US TO 
REMEMBER THIS WEEK. 
>> WE ARE WATCHING THE McCAIN 
FAMILY LINE UP ALTOGETHER TO 
PROCESS INTO THE CATHEDRAL. 
CINDY McCAIN THERE WITH HER SON 
JIMMY ESCORTING HER.
WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE 
FORMER PRESIDENTS YOU SAW A 
MOMENT AGO, FORMER PRESIDENT. 
BILL CLINTON, VICE PRESIDENT AL 
GORE,  THERE TO PAY THEIR 
RESPECTS. 
AND REMEMBER 
BOB, YOU NEEDLED McCAIN ABOUT 
HILLARY CLINTON CALLING HIM HER 
FAVORITE REPUBLICAN. 
>> I ASKED HIM THE OBVIOUS 
QUESTION, IS SHE YOUR FAVORITE 
DEMOCRAT AND HE SAID IS THIS 
SHOW BEING BLACKED OUT IN 
ARIZONA? 
 
>> WE ARE WATCHING AS THEY OPEN 
UP THE HEARSE TO BRING IN THE 
FLAG DRAPED COFFIN, INTO THE 
CATHEDRAL.
AND IT IS AGAIN, A CEREMONY 
THAT THE SENATOR HIMSELF HELPED 
TO OKA STRAIGHT, TO PLAN DOWN 
TO THE GREETINGS, DANNY BAY -- 
DANNY BOY WILL BE SUNG BY A 
FAMOUS OPERA SINGER. 
THE MILITARY HONOR GUARD IS 
THERE FROM ALL BRANCHES OF THE 
SERVICE. 
GATHERING TO ESCORT HIM IN. 
WE NOTE THAT THE SENATOR ALSO, 
WHEN IT COMES TO THE 
PALLBEARERS HE HAS CHOSEN 
INSIDE THE CATHEDRAL AND AGAIN 
TOMORROW IN ANNAPOLIS, A 
SMATTERING OF WHO'S WHO IN 
WASHINGTON, ALSO HOLLYWOOD. 
FRIENDS OF HIS, AND EVEN SOME 
POLITICIANS AND DISSIDENTS. 
ALL OF IT A STATEMENT.
>>
LET US PRAY THEN FOR OUR 
BROTHER JOHN. 
THAT HE MAY REST FROM HIS LABORS
AND ENTER INTO THE LIGHT OF 
GOD'S ETERNAL SABBATH REST.
WITH FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST, WE 
RECEIVE THE BODY OF OUR BROTHER 
JOHN FOR BURIAL. 
LET US PRAY WITH CONFIDENCE TO 
GOD, THE GIVER OF LIFE THAT GOD 
WILL RAISE HIM TO PERFECTION IN 
THE COMPANY OF THE SAINTS.
DELIVER YOUR SERVANT JOHN, 
SOVEREIGN LORD CHRIST, FROM ALL 
EVIL. 
AND SET HIM FREE FROM EVERY 
BOND. 
THAT HE MAY REST WITH ALL YOUR 
SAINTS IN THE ETERNAL 
HABITATIONS WHERE WITH THE 
FATHER AND THE HOLY SPIRIT YOU 
LIVE AND REIGN, ONE GOD FOR EVER
AND EVER. 
AMEN.
LET US ALSO PRAY FOR ALL WHO 
MOURN THAT THEY MAY CAST OF 
THEIR CARE ON GOD AND NO THE 
CONSOLATION OF HIS LOVE. 
-- KNOW THE CONSOLATION OF HIS 
LOVE. 
ALMIGHTY GOD LOOK WITH PITY 
UPON THE SORROWS OF YOUR 
SERVANT FOR WHOM WE PRAY. 
REMEMBER THEM GRACIOUS GOD IN 
MERCY, NOURISH THEM WITH 
PATIENCE, COMFORT THEM WITH A 
SENSE OF YOUR GOODNESS. 
LIFT UP YOUR COUNTENANCE UPON 
THEM AND GIVE THEM PEACE. 
THROUGH JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD. 
AMEN.
YOU ARE LISTENING TO THE UNITED 
STATES NAVY BAND BRASS ENSEMBLE 
PLAY AS THE CASKET IS BROUGHT 
INTO THE NATIONAL CATHEDRAL 
THERE.
THIS IS THE SENATOR'S MOTHER 
THERE, 106 YEARS OLD.
MINORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER, 
AND OTHER SENATORS. 
YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE ARRAY OF 
FORMER PRESIDENTS WHO HAVE, 
ALONG WITH FORMER FIRST LADY'S 
TO HONOR THE LIFE OF SENATOR. 
McCAIN.  
GEORGE W. BUSH, LAURA BUSH, THE 
OBAMA'S, 
THE CLINTONS, AND THERE YOU ARE 
LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS. 
DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL 
INTELLIGENCE, ECONOMIC ADVISOR, 
AMBASSADOR JOHN HOLTON, 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR TO 
THE PRESIDENT AND OF COURSE 
JOHN KELLY CHIEF OF STAFF, 
LONGTIME FRIEND OF THE McCAIN 
FAMILY.
IVANKA TRUMP ALONG WITH JARED 
KUSHNER,  FAMILY MEMBERS OF THE 
TRUMP FAMILY PERSONALLY 
REPRESENTING HIM. 
AND FORMER VICE PRESIDENT AL 
GORE. 
FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARIES 
PANETTA AND ASH CARTER THERE. 
WHO SERVED IN THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION, OF COURSE LEON 
PANETTA SERVED IN MANY ROLES, 
CIA DIRECTOR AS WELL. 
A LONGTIME CONGRESSMAN. 
THE VOICE YOU ARE HEARING WITH 
THE OPENING PRAYER, MARION -- 
REVEREND. 
MARY AND EDGAR BOO DAY,  
BEGINNING THE CEREMONY.
OF COURSE HENRY KISSINGER, 
FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE, 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER, 
SOMEONE WHOSE FATE WAS VERY 
MUCH INTERTWINED WITH JOHN 
McCAIN, HE OF COURSE NEGOTIATED 
THE END TO COMBAT IN VIETNAM. 
1973. 
AND JOHN McCAIN RECALLS 
THANKING HIM AFTER THE FACT FOR 
NOT PERSONALLY REQUESTING HIS 
RELEASE. BEHIND HIM YOU SAW THE 
REPUBLICAN SENATOR FROM SOUTH 
CAROLINA, LINDSEY GRAHAM, 
LONGTIME FRIEND OF JOHN McCAIN. 
ONE OF THE THREE AMIGOS AS HIS 
GOOD FRIENDS IN THE SENATE WERE 
CALLED. 
WE WERE TALKING EARLIER ABOUT 
SENATOR. 
LIEBERMAN AS WELL FROM 
CONNECTICUT.  
>> GIVEN THAT NAME BY GENERAL. 
BETRAY US ON ONE OF THEIR 
VISITS TO IRAQ,  WHICH WE 
HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT. 
BUT McCAIN'S SUPPORT FOR 
PRETORIUS AND MATUS WHO WERE 
THE ARCHITECTS OF THE SURGE OF 
THE FINAL INCREASE IN TROOPS. 
McCAIN THE STRONGEST ADVOCATE 
FOR THAT. 
DURING THE 2008 CAMPAIGN WHEN 
THAT WAS QUITE AN UNPOPULAR 
POSITION TO HOLD. 
EVEN WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN 
PARTY.
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE HARD 
ONE, HARD-FOUGHT BATTLES THAT 
HE'S BEEN THROUGH, GEORGE W 
BUSH AND JOHN McCAIN WENT HEAD-
TO-HEAD. 
>> OH, THEY REALLY DID. 
AND IT JUST DISCOMBOBULATED THE 
BUSH CAMPAIGN WHEN JOHN McCAIN 
BEAT THEM IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. 
IN 2008. 
I REMEMBER GEORGE BUSH HAD BEEN 
MY GUEST ON FACE THE NATION THE 
SUNDAY BEFORE THE PRIMARY AND 
AFTERWARD HE SAID TO ME, HE SAID
BOB WE'RE NOT GOING TO JUST 
WIN, WE ARE GOING TO REALLY 
WIN. 
AND THEN McCAIN CAME ALONG AND 
BEAT THEM. 
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. 
IT STUNNED THE WHOLE 
ESTABLISHMENT. 
I THINK BUSH LATER SAID THAT IT 
WAS THE BEST THING THAT 
COULD'VE HAPPENED TO HIM 
BECAUSE THEY REALIZED THEY 
DIDN'T HAVE IT ONE. 
THE SAD PART OF IT WAS IS THAT 
THE McCAIN CAMPAIGN REALLY 
TURNED NASTY WHEN THEY WENT TO 
SOUTH CAROLINA. 
I THINK BOTH CAMPAIGNS DID 
THINGS IN THOSE WEEKS THAT THEY 
PROBABLY IN RETROSPECT WISH 
THEY HADN'T DONE. 
BUT BUSH ALSO WENT ON TO WIN 
AND WENT ON TO WIN THE 
NOMINATION. 
BUT IT WAS REALLY REALLY MEAN. 
>> YES AND VERY PERSONAL ABOUT 
SENATOR. 
McCAIN'S FAMILY, ABOUT HIS WAR 
SERVICE.  
IT GOT ABOUT AS NASTY AS IT CAN 
GET IN THAT PERIOD BETWEEN WHEN 
BUSH, BOB MENTIONED McCAIN, HE 
USED TO JOKE THAT HE WAS IN 2% 
OF THE POLLS WHEN HE STARTED 
THE NEW HAMPSHIRE WHICH MEANT 
THAT IF YOU CONSIDER THE MARGIN 
OF ERROR HE MIGHT'VE BEEN IN 
THE NEGATIVE TERRITORY. 
HE CAME FROM THAT TINY SPACE, 
STOLE THE MONEY AND 
ESTABLISHMENT ENDORSEMENTS THAT 
GEORGE BUSH HAD AND GRIND IT 
OUT WITH ALL THOSE TOWN HALLS 
AND ONE THEM AND HIS ARGUMENT 
WAS IF I CAN BEAT THE SYSTEM IN 
THIS I CAN BEAT IT IN 
WASHINGTON. 
I CAN CHANGE THINGS IN 
WASHINGTON. 
THAT FOR HIM, NEW HAMPSHIRE AND 
THE PETERBOROUGH TOWN HALL 
WHERE IT ALL STARTED ALTHOUGH 
HE WAS A SENATOR FROM ARIZONA 
AND LOVED IT, AND LOVED SEDONA, 
HE HAD SOME NEW HAMPSHIRE IN 
HIM BECAUSE OF HIS EXPERIENCES 
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, BOTH IN 2000 
AND IN 2008. 
>> BUT THEY REALLY, I DON'T 
THINK THIS IS OVERSTATING IT TO 
SAY THAT IN LATER YEARS BUSH 
AND McCAIN ACTUALLY BECAME 
FRIENDS. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
>> AND THEY WOULD TALK ON THE 
PHONE. 
>> AND I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT, 
AND THE SURGE WAS PART OF IT. 
THE IRAQ WAR WAS NOT GOING WELL 
AND BUSH WAS SO BACKED BY THAT 
DECISION ABOUT WHETHER TO SEND 
MORE TROOPS THAT HE WAS 
GRINDING HIS TEETH AT NIGHT AND 
COULDN'T SLEEP. 
TO HAVE AN ALLY AND JOHN McCAIN 
TO SAY YOU SHOULD DO THIS, THIS 
IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO, IT 
WAS AN ALLY AT A VERY IMPORTANT 
TIME WHEN A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE 
DISTANCING THEMSELVES FROM THE 
PRESIDENT AND THE IRAQ WAR. 
>> AND HE DIDN'T LIKE TO TALK 
ABOUT IT MUCH BUT HIS OWN SON 
WAS SERVING IN THAT WAR. 
HE WOULD TELL THE STORY ABOUT 
HOW HIS SON WAS DIGGING A 
DITCH, HE WAS ENLISTED AS A 
MARINE AND AN OFFICER CAME OUT 
AND SAID MARINE YOUR FATHER 
JUST WON THE PRIMARY. 
AND HE STOPPED FOR A SECOND AND 
HE SAID GO BACK TO DIGGING. 
 BUT IT WAS JUST 
SUCH A WORLD AWAY. 
WITH HIS SON ON THE FRONT 
LINES. 
IT IS SUCH A STATEMENT TO STAND 
WITH THAT SURGE. 
>> THERE YOU SEE SENATOR. 
BOB DOLE, THE 96 NOMINEE FOR 
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY  WHO WORE 
A BRACELET WHEN THEY HAD 
BRACELETS FOR POWS IN VIETNAM, 
HE WORE A BRACELET WHICH HE 
LATER TOLD JOHN McCAIN THE POW 
BRACELET THAT BOB DOLE WORE WAS 
JOHN McCAIN'S BRACELET.
>> BOB DOLE IS WHAT, MID-90s? 
I WOULD THINK. 
>> HENRY KISSINGER IS ABOUT 95 
YEARS OLD.
I MEAN THIS IS A GATHERING 
>> 95 I THINK. 
>> STILL SO REMARKABLE TO SEE 
THESE THREE MARK TO HAVE AL GORE
JUST A FEW STEPS FROM GEORGE 
BUSH AND TO SEE ALL -- OBAMA 
AND BUSH SPEAKING TO THEM.
>>> I REMEMBER READING HIS FACE 
TURNED AS RED AS HIS TIED THE 
MOMENT AFTER McCAIN VOTED NO.  
TEARFULLY RECALLED HIS 
COLLEAGUE THIS WEEK. 
>> THEIR NAMES COME NEXT TO 
EACH OTHER BUT THERE WERE TIMES 
WHEN THERE WERE NO TWO SENATORS 
FURTHER APART. 
PARTICULARLY ON CAMPAIGN-
FINANCE REFORM. 
McCAIN WHEN HE RAN FOR 
PRESIDENT  ESSENTIALLY SAID 
WE'VE ALL BEEN CORRUPTED BY THE 
SYSTEM. 
BEING THINGS DON'T GET DONE 
BECAUSE THE MONEY FORCES US TO 
NOT ACT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF 
OUR COUNTRY, WHICH WAS 
ESSENTIALLY CALLING OUT ALL OF 
HIS COLLEAGUES AND HIMSELF. 
MITCH McCONNELL WAS OFFENDED BY 
THAT AND ALSO WAS A POLICY 
MATTER. 
DIDN'T BELIEVE IN THE SAME.  
IN CAMPAIGN-FINANCE, THEY COULD 
NOT HAVE BEEN STRONGER 
ADVERSARIES ON THAT ISSUE. 
>> CERTAINLY EARNING HIMSELF 
THE TITLE OF MAVERICK 
POLITICALLY. 
WE SPOKE WITH FORMER U.S. 
SENATOR, SECRETARY OF STATE 
FORMERLY JOHN KELLY AND HE 
SAID, WE FLIRTED.  
WE DIDN'T GO ON A DATE BUT WE 
TALKED ABOUT EVEN POSSIBLY 
RUNNING TOGETHER AS A 
PRESIDENTIAL TICKET. 
REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT.  
SEEMS ALMOST UNTHINKABLE THESE 
DAYS.  
>> YES. 
THAT WAS NEW WHEN YOU GOT THAT 
FROM JOHN KERRY. 
I HAD NEVER HEARD THAT STORY.  
I DIDN'T KNOW THEY TALKED ABOUT 
IT.  
BUT THE IDEA OF PUTTING 
LIEBERMAN ON THE TICKET, OF 
COURSE, HIS ADVISORS TOLD HIM, 
NOT ONLY ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE 
PEOPLE WALK OUT OF THIS 
REPUBLICAN CONVENTION IF YOU DO 
THAT, THEY MIGHT NOT EVEN 
CERTIFY YOU AS THE NOMINEE.  
>> TO HAVE AN INDEPENDENT. 
>> HE LITERALLY BLEW HIS TOP 
AND HE SAID, OKAY, YOU GO FIND 
SOMEBODY.  
>> AND THEY DID.  
SARAH PALIN. 
THE McCAIN FAMILY  COMING INTO 
THE NATIONAL CATHEDRAL TO TAKE 
THEIR POSITION FOR THIS 
CELEBRATION OF LIFE.>> WE HEARD 
FROM THE McCAIN FAMILY THIS 
WEEK IN READINGS  BUT MEGHAN 
McCAIN WILL GIVE A TRIBUTE TO 
HER FATHER AND THAT'S GOING TO 
BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR HER BUT 
IT REALLY IS QUITE AN EMOTIONAL 
MOMENT WE HAVE JUST AHEAD OF US 
AT THE START OF THE REMARKS 
TODAY.  
>> THE MUSICAL INTERLUDE IS 
"GIRL WITH A FLAXEN HAIR" 
PERFORMED BY THE UNITED STATES 
NAVY BRASS BAND AS THE FAMILY 
TAKES THEIR SEATS.  
>> THIS IS SUCH A MAGNIFICENT 
SETTING.  
>> I BELIEVE THREE U.S. 
PRESIDENTS HAVE HAD THEIR 
FUNERAL MASSES SET AT THE 
NATIONAL CATHEDRAL. 
JOHN McCAIN WENT TO EPISCOPAL 
SCHOOLS AND CORRUPT EPISCOPAL 
BUT IN THE LATTER PART OF HIS 
LIFE AS YOU SAW EARLIER THIS 
WEEK CELEBRATED AND WORSHIPED 
AND THE BAPTIST CHURCH.  
>> WHEN HE WAS AT EPISCOPAL, 
THERE'S A FAMOUS STORY ABOUT THE
PRINCIPAL CALLED HIS FATHER AND 
SAID, HE'S JUST NOT DOING WELL. 
HIS GRADES. 
THE USUAL REPORT THE McCAIN 
FAMILY GOT FROM THIS STUDENT, 
McCAIN. 
HIS FATHER SAID, HAVE YOU 
CAUGHT HIM LYING WORST  
DEALING? 
THEY SAID, NO. 
HE SAID, CALL ME IF YOU DO AND 
THAT WAS HOW HE WAS BROUGHT UP. 
>> LOOKING AT A SHOT OF VICE 
PRESIDENT -- FORMER VICE 
PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN WHO EARLIER 
THIS WEEK IN ARIZONA SPOKE 
ABOUT THEIR LONGTIME 
FRIENDSHIP. 
EVEN BEFORE JOHN McCAIN WAS 
ELECTED SENATOR BUT SERVED AS A 
MILITARY AIDE ON CAPITOL HILL 
TO A YOUNG SENATOR, SENATOR 
BIDEN.  
HE SAID, JOE BIDEN, I'M A 
DEMOCRAT AND I LOVE JOHN 
McCAIN. 
>> HE WAS ONE OF 15 PALLBEARERS 
INCLUDING MIKE BLOOMBERG, 
FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY 
WILLIAM COHEN, GARY HART. 
THEY WERE IN HIS WEDDING TO 
CINDY McCAIN AND ARE NOW 
PALLBEARERS TODAY. 
THAT'S QUITE A TRIBUTE TO THEIR 
FRIENDS. 
ALSO, DEALING -- THE ONLY 
SITTING SENATOR SITTING TODAY 
IS A DEMOCRAT FROM IRELAND WHO 
TRAVELED FREQUENTLY OVERSEAS 
AND ONE OF HIS CLOSE COLLEAGUES 
IN THE SENATE. 
>> THE FORMER SENATOR FROM NEW 
HAMPSHIRE WILL BE ON THE 
PROGRAM. 
>> SHE BECAME THE THIRD AMIGA 
WANTS LIEBERMAN LEFT.  
>> THESE TRIPS -- ASH CARTER 
BEFORE HE WAS SECRETARY OF 
DEFENSE HE USED TO GO TO THE 
MUNICH SECURITY CONFERENCE WITH 
McCAIN. 
THESE TRIPS HE WAS CONSTANTLY 
TAKING  IS WHERE A LOT OF THESE 
FRIENDSHIPS WERE BUILT. 
THE STRAIGHT TALK SUCCESS WAS 
ONE LONG CONVERSATION AND THERE 
WAS A VERSION IN SENATE WITH 
SENATE COLLEAGUES AND THE 
ACADEMICS. 
EVEN SOMETIME JOURNALISTS ON 
THOSE PLANES AND THEY WOULD BE 
FLYING OVER THE ATLANTIC FOR 
HOURS AND EVEN THE PACIFIC, IN 
SOME CASES AND THEY WOULD CHEW 
THROUGH THESE TOPICS AND THAT 
WAS WHERE THESE RELATIONSHIPS 
WERE CREATED AND MAINTAINED.  
>> YOU CAN SEE THE MILITARY 
GUARD ESCORTING IN THE COFFIN 
FOLLOWED BY SOME OF THE 
PALLBEARERS.  
AS ED WAS JUST TELLING YOU, A 
NUMBER OF DISTINGUISHED NAMES 
INCLUDING MARK SALTER,  DEAR 
FRIEND OF THE McCAIN FAMILY . 
THE FOUNDER OF FEDEX, FRED 
SMITH, FORMER VIETNAM WAR -- 
SERVED IN THE VIETNAM WAR.  
ALSO IN ANOTHER FINAL STATEMENT 
A RUSSIAN POLITICIAN WHO NEARLY 
LOST HIS LIFE TWICE AFTER BEING 
-- HE SAID, BEING POISONED BY 
THE PURITAN REGIME OF RUSSIA. 
BIG STATEMENT FOUGHT McCAIN.  
>>> I AM RESURRECTION AND I AM 
LIFE, SAYS THE LORD. 
WHOEVER HAS FAITH IN ME, SHALL 
HAVE LIFE EVEN THOUGH HE DIE.  
AND EVERYONE WHO HAS LIFE AND 
HAS COMMITTED HIMSELF TO ME IN 
FAITH SHALL NOT DIE FOREVER.  
HAS FOR ME, -- AS FOR ME, I 
KNOW THAT MY REDEEMER LIVES AND 
THAT AT THE LAST HE WILL STAND 
UPON THE EARTH AND AFTER MY 
AWAKING HE WILL RAISE ME UP AND 
IN MY BODY I SHALL SEE GOD.  
I MYSELF SHALL SEE AND BEHOLD 
HIM WHO IS MY FRIEND AND NOT A 
STRANGER.  
FOR NONE OF US HAS LIFE IN 
HIMSELF.  
AND NONE BECOMES HIS OWN MASTER 
WHEN HE DIES.  
FOR IF WE HAVE LIFE, WE ARE 
ALIVE IN THE LORD, AND IF WE 
DIE, WE DIE IN THE LORD.
SO THEN WHETHER WE LIVE OR DIE, 
WE ARE THE LORD'S POSSESSION.  
HAPPY FROM NOW ON ARE THOSE WHO 
DIE IN THE LORD.  
SO IT IS SAYS THE SPIRIT FOR 
THEY REST FROM THEIR LABORS.
>>> 
>>> PLEASE BE SEATED. 
GOOD MORNING.  
I AM DEAN OF WASHINGTON AFTER 
ALL -- NATIONAL CATHEDRAL AND 
ON BEHALF OF MARIANN EDGAR 
BUDDE, THE DIOCESE OF 
WASHINGTON AND ALL OF US WHO 
SERVE OUR LORD AT THIS 
CATHEDRAL, WELCOME.  
WELCOME TO THIS HOUSE OF PRAYER 
FOR ALL PEOPLE. 
IT IS IN HONOR TO HOST THIS 
SERVICE FOR SENATOR McCAIN.
TO SENATOR McCAIN'S WIFE, 
CINDY, AND HIS MOTHER, ROBERTA, 
AND THE ENTIRE McCAIN FAMILY,  
OUR HEARTS ARE WITH YOU AND 
WITH ALL THOSE ACROSS OUR 
COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD TO 
GRIEVE THE LOSS OF THIS GREAT 
AMERICAN PATRIOT AND STATESMAN. 
TODAY WEEK IS JOHN SIDNEY 
McCAIN THE THIRD BACK TO THEY 
GOT OF LOVE GAVE HIM TO US.  
WHILE WE MOURN HIS DEATH, OUR 
FAITH TELLS US THAT BEYOND THIS 
LIFE THERE IS INDEED MORE LIFE. 
AND GOD NEVER LETS US GO.  
SO AS THE OLD PRAYER SAYS, WE 
GATHER TO GIVE THANKS FOR ALL 
THE GOODNESS AND COURAGE THAT 
HAVE PASSED FROM McCAIN'S LIFE 
INTO THE LIVES OF OTHERS  AND 
HAVE LEFT THE WORLD A RICHER 
AND BETTER PLACE. 
FOR HIS LIFE'S TASKS FAVORABLY 
TO AND HONORABLY DISCHARGED FOR 
GOOD HUMOR, GRACIOUS AFFECTION, 
KINDLY GENEROSITY.  
FOR SADNESS MET WITHOUT 
SURRENDER AND WEAKNESS ENDURED 
WITHOUT DEFEAT.  
MAY THE LORD BLESS HIM AND KEEP 
HIM THIS DAY AND ALWAYS.  
THANK YOU.
>>  THE WORLD IS A FINE PLACE 
AND WORTH FIGHTING FOR AND I 
HATE VERY MUCH TO LEAVE IT. 
WHEN ERNEST HEMINGWAY'S LIES 
WOUNDED WAITING FOR HIS LAST 
FIGHT THESE ARE AMONG HIS FINAL 
THOUGHTS. 
MY FATHER HAD EVERY REASON TO 
THINK THE WORLD WAS AN AWFUL 
PLACE. 
MY FATHER HAD EVERY REASON TO 
THINK THE WORLD WAS NOT WORTH 
FIGHTING FOR. 
MY FATHER HAD EVERY REASON TO 
THINK THE WORLD WAS WORTH 
LEAVING. 
HE DID NOT THINK ANY OF THOSE 
THINGS. 
LIKE THE HERO OF HIS FAVORITE 
BOOK, JOHN McCAIN TOOK THE 
OPPOSITE VIEW. 
YOU HAD TO HAVE A LOT OF FLOCK 
TO HAVE HAD SUCH A GOOD LIFE.  
I AM HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY 
SAYING THE WORDS: I HAVE NEVER 
WANTED TO SAY, GIVING THE 
SPEECH I HAVE NEVER WANTED TO 
GIVE. 
FEELING THE LOSS I HAVE NEVER 
WANTED TO FEEL.  
MY FATHER IS GONE.
JOHN SIDNEY McCAIN III WAS MANY 
THINGS. 
HE WAS A SAILOR, HE WAS AND 
AVIATOR,  HE WAS A HUSBAND, HE 
WAS A WARRIOR, HE WAS A 
PRISONER.  
HE WAS A HERO, HE WAS A 
CONGRESSMAN, HE WAS A SENATOR, 
HE WAS A NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES. 
THESE ARE ALL THE TITLES AND 
THE ROLES OF A LIFE THAT HAS 
BEEN WELL LIVED. 
THEY ARE NOT THE GREATEST OF 
HIS TITLES. 
NOR THE MOST IMPORTANT OF HIS 
ROLES. 
HE WAS A GREAT MAN. 
WE GATHER HERE TO MOURN THE 
PASSING OF AMERICAN GREATNESS.  
THE REAL THING.  
NOT CHEAP RHETORIC FROM MEN WHO 
WILL NEVER COME NEAR THE 
SACRIFICE HE GAVE SO WILLINGLY. 
NOR THE OPPORTUNISTIC 
APPROPRIATION OF THOSE WHO LIVE 
LIVES OF COMFORT AND PRIVILEGE 
WILL HE SUFFERED AND SERVED. 
HE WAS A GREAT FIRE WHO BURNED 
BRIGHT.  
IN THE PAST FEW DAYS, MY FAMILY 
AND I HAVE HEARD FROM SO MANY 
OF THOSE AMERICANS WHO STOOD IN 
THE WARMTH AND LIGHT OF HIS 
FIRE AND FOUND IT ILLUMINATED 
WHAT IS BEST ABOUT THEM. 
WE ARE GRATEFUL TO THEM BECAUSE 
THEY ARE GRATEFUL TO HIM. 
IF YOU HAVE RESENTED THAT FIRE, 
FOR THAT LIGHT IT CAST UPON 
THEM, FOR THE TRUTH IT REVEALED 
ABOUT THEIR CHARACTER, BUT MY 
FATHER NEVER CARED WHAT THEY 
THOUGHT AND EVEN THAT SMALL 
NUMBER STILL HAVE THE 
OPPORTUNITY AS LONG AS THEY 
DRAW BREATH TO LIVE UP THE TO 
THE EXAMPLE OF JOHN McCAIN. 
MY FATHER WAS A GREAT MAN. 
HE WAS A GREAT WARRIOR. 
HE WAS A GREAT AMERICAN.  I 
ADMIRED HIM FOR ALL OF THESE 
THINGS BUT I LOVE HIM BECAUSE 
HE WAS A GREAT FATHER.  
MY FATHER KNEW WHAT IT WAS LIKE 
TO GROW UP IN THE SHADOW OF 
GREATNESS. 
HE DID JUST AS HIS FATHER HAD 
DONE BEFORE HIM. 
HE WAS THE SON OF A GREAT 
ADMIRAL WHO WAS ALSO THE SON OF 
THE GREAT ART MERRILL -- 
ADMIRAL AND IT WHEN KING -- IT 
BECAME TIME HE HAD NO CHOICE 
BUT TO WALK IN THE EXACT PATH. 
HE HAD TO BECOME A SAILOR, GO 
TO WAR, HAD TO HAVE HIS SHOT AT 
BECOMING A GREAT ADMIRAL AS 
THEY ALSO HAD DONE. 
THE PATH OF HIS FATHER AND 
GRANDFATHER LET MY FATHER 
DIRECTLY TO THE HARROWING HELL 
OF THE HANOI HILTON. 
THIS IS A PUBLIC LEGEND THAT IS 
JOHN McCAIN. 
THIS IS WHERE ALL THE 
BIOGRAPHIES IN THE CAMPAIGN 
LITERATURE AND PUBLIC 
REMEMBRANCES SAY HE SHOWED HIS 
CHARACTER, HIS PATRIOTISM, HIS 
FAITH, AND HIS ENDURANCE IN THE 
WORST OF POSSIBLE 
CIRCUMSTANCES. 
THIS IS WHERE WE LEARNED WHO 
JOHN McCAIN TRULY WAS.  
AND ALL OF THAT IS VERY TRUE 
EXCEPT FOR THE LAST PART.  
TODAY WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU 
WHERE I FOUND OUT WHO JOHN 
McCAIN TRULY WAS. 
IT WASN'T IN THE HANOI HILTON.  
IT WASN'T IN THE COCKPIT OF A 
FAST AND LEAVE THE FIGHTER 
JETS. 
IT WASN'T ON THE HIGH SEAS OR 
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. 
JOHN McCAIN WAS IN ALL OF THOSE 
PLACES BUT THE BEST OF HIM WAS 
SOMEWHERE ELSE. 
THE BEST OF JOHN McCAIN, THE 
GREATEST OF HIS TITLES, AND THE 
MOST IMPORTANT OF HIS ROLES WAS 
AS A FATHER. 
IMAGINE THE WARRIOR THE NIGHT 
OF THE SKIES -- KNIGHT OF THE 
SKIES CARRYING HIS LITTLE GIRL 
TO BED, OVER IN THE SOUTH CHINA 
SEAS, KISSING THE HURT WHEN I 
FELL AND SKINNED MY KNEE AND 
THE DISTINGUISHED STATESMAN WHO 
COUNSELED PRESIDENT IN THE 
POWERFUL SINGING WITH HIS 
LITTLE GIRL IN OAK CREEK DURING 
A RAINSTORM TO "SINGING IN THE 
RAIN."  
IMAGINE A SENATOR, FIERCE 
CONSCIENCE OF THE NATION'S BEST 
SELF TAKING HIS DAUGHTER OUT OF 
SCHOOL BECAUSE HE BELIEVED I 
WOULD LEARN MORE ABOUT AMERICA 
AT THE TOWN HALLS HE HELD 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 
IMAGINE THE ELDERLY VETERAN OF 
WAR AND GOVERNMENT WHOSE WISDOM 
AND COURAGE WERE SOUGHT BY THE 
MOST DISTINGUISHED MEN OF OUR 
TIME WITH HIS EYES SHINING AS 
HAPPINESS AS HE GAVE HIS 
BLESSING FOR HIS GROWN 
DAUGHTER'S MARRIAGE. 
YOU ALL HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT.  
I DON'T HAVE TO BECAUSE I LIVED 
IT ALL.  
I KNOW WHO HE WAS.  
I KNOW WHAT DEFINED HIM. 
I GOT TO SEE IT EVERY SINGLE 
DAY OF MY BLESSED LIFE.  
JOHN McCAIN WAS NOT DEFINED BY 
PRISON, BY THE NAVY, BY THE 
SENATE, BY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY 
OR BY ANY SINGLE ONE OF THE 
DEEDS AND IS ABSOLUTELY 
EXTRAORDINARY LIFE. 
JOHN McCAIN WAS DEFINED BY 
LOVE.  
SEVERAL OF YOU OUT THERE PEWS 
CROSSED WORKED WITH HIM OR 
FOUND YOURSELF ON THE RECEIVING 
END OF HIS TEMPER OR YOU ARE 
DOING YOUR BEST TO STAY STONED 
FACE.  
DON'T. 
YOU KNOW IF JOHN McCAIN WERE IN 
YOUR SHOES HE WOULD BE USING 
SOME SALTY WORD HE LEARNED IN 
THE NAVY WHILE MY MOTHER JABBED 
HIM IN THE ARM AND 
EMBARRASSMENT. 
HE WOULD LOOK BACK AT HER AND 
MAYBE STOP TALKING BUT HE WOULD 
KEEP GRINNING. 
SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD 
DO THAT.  
ON THEIR FIRST DATE, WHEN HE 
STILL DID NOT KNOW WHAT SORT OF 
WOMAN SHE WAS, HE RECITED A 
POEM CALLED: THE CREMATION OF 
SAM McGEE ABOUT AN ALASKAN 
PROSPECTOR WHO WELCOMED HIS 
CREMATION IS THE ONLY WAY TO 
GET WARM IN THE ICY AREA.  
THERE ARE STRANGE THINGS DONE 
IN THE MIDNIGHT SUN BY THE MEN 
WHO MOIL FOR GOLD.  
ARCTIC TRAILS OF SECRET TALES 
THAT WOULD MAKE YOUR BLOOD RUN 
COLD. 
HE LEARNED IT IN HANOI. 
A PRISONER IN THE NEXT CELL HAD 
WRITTEN IT OUT. 
IF SHE COULD APPRECIATE THE 
DARK HUMOR THAT HAD SEEN HIM 
THROUGH SO MANY YEARS OF 
IMPRISONMENT, SHE JUST MIGHT 
SIT THROUGH A LIFETIME WITH 
HIM, AS WELL, AND SHE DID. 
JOHN McCAIN WAS DEFINED BY 
LOVE.  
THIS LOVE OF MY FATHER FROM MY 
MOTHER WAS THE MOST FIERCE AND 
LASTING OF THEM ALL, MOM.  
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT LOVE MEANT 
TO JOHN McCAIN. 
AND ME. 
HIS LOVE WAS A LOVE OF A 
FATHER. 
AS MUCH AS HE COMFORTS, HE WAS 
AND JUSTLY PRESENT FOR US AND 
WE DID NOT ALWAYS UNDERSTAND IT 
BUT HE WAS ALWAYS TEACHING.  
HE DIDN'T EXPECT US TO BE LIKE 
HIM. 
HIS AMBITIONS FOR US WAS TO BE 
BETTER THAN HIM. 
ARMED WITH HIS WISDOM AND 
INFORMED BY HIS EXPERIENCES 
LONG BEFORE WE WERE EVEN OLD 
ENOUGH TO HAVEASSEMBLED OUR 
OWN. 
IS A GIRL, I DID NOT FULLY 
APPRECIATE WHAT I FULLY 
APPRECIATE NOW.  
HOW HE SUFFERED AND HOW HE WORE 
IT WITH HIS STOIC SILENCE THAT 
WAS ONCE THE MARK OF IN 
AMERICAN MAN.  
I CAME TO APPRECIATE IT FIRST 
WHEN HE DEMANDED IT OF ME. 
I WAS A SMALL GIRL THROWN FROM 
A HORSE AND CRYING FROM A 
BUSTED COLLARBONE. 
MY DAD PICKED ME UP TOOK ME TO 
THE DOCTOR AND GOT ME ALL FIXED 
UP. 
HE IMMEDIATELY TOOK ME BACK 
HOME AND MADE ME GET BACK ON 
THAT VERY SAME HORSE. 
I WAS FURIOUS AT HIM AS A CHILD 
BT HOW I LOVE HIM FOR IT NOW.  
MY FATHER KNEW PAIN AND 
SUFFERING WITH ANKLE INTIMACY 
AND IMMEDIACY THAT MOST OF US 
ARE BLESSED NEVER TO HAVE 
ENDURED. 
HE WAS SHOT DOWN, CRIPPLED, 
BEATEN, STARVED, TORTURED, AND 
HUMILIATED.  
THAT PAIN NEVER LEFT HIM. 
THE CRUELTY OF HIS COMMUNIST 
CAPTORS IN SHORT HE WOULD NEVER 
RAISE HIS ARMS ABOVE HIS HEAD 
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.  
YET HE SURVIVED, YET HE 
ENDURED, YET HE TRIUMPHED. 
THERE WA THIS MAN WHO HAD BEEN 
THROUGH ALL OF THAT WITH A 
LITTLE GIRL WHO SIMPLY DIDN'T 
WANT TO GET BACK ON HER HORSE. 
HE COULD HAVE SAT ME DOWN AND 
TOLD ME ALL OF THAT AND MADE ME 
FEEL SMALL BECAUSE MY COMPLAINT 
AND FEAR WAS NOTHING NEXT TO 
HIS PAIN AND MEMORY. 
INSTEAD HE MADE ME FEEL LOVED, 
HE SAID, MEGAN, AND IS QUITE'S 
VOICE -- WHITE VOICE THAT SPOKE 
WITH AUTHORITY, GET BACK ON THE 
HORSE. 
I DID AND BECAUSE I WAS A 
LITTLE GIRL I RESENTED IT. 
NOW THAT I AM A WOMAN, I LOOKED 
BACK ACROSS THAT TIME AND SEE 
THE EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE WHEN 
I CLIMBED BACK UP AND RODE 
AGAIN AND I SEE THE PRIDE AS HE 
SAYS, NOTHING IS GOING TO BREAK 
YOU.  
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, 
WHENEVER I FALL DOWN I GET BACK 
UP. 
WHENEVER I AM HURT I DRIVE ON 
AND WHEN I AM BROUGHT LOW, I 
RISE BUT THAT IS NOT BECAUSE I 
AM UNIQUELY VIRTUOUS OR STRONG 
OR RESILIENT.  
IT'S SIMPLY BECAUSE MY FATHER,  
JOHN McCAIN,  WAS. 
WHEN MY FATHER GOT SICK, WHEN I 
ASKED HIM WHAT HE WANTED ME TO 
DO WITH THIS EULOGY, HE SAID, 
SHOW THEM HOW TOUGH YOU ARE.  
THAT IS WHAT LOVE MEANT TO JOHN 
McCAIN.  
LOVE FOR MY FATHER ALSO MEANT 
CARING FOR THE NATION ENTRUSTED 
TO HIM. 
MY FATHER, THE TRUE SON OF HIS 
FATHER AND GRANDFATHER WAS BORN 
INTO AN ENDURING SENSE OF THE 
CHARACTER OF AMERICAN GREATNESS 
AND WAS CONVINCED OF THE NEED 
TO DEFEND IT WITH FEROCITY AND 
FAITH.
JOHN McCAIN WAS BORN IN A 
DISTANT AND NOW VANQUISHED 
OUTPOST OF AMERICAN POWER  AND 
HE UNDERSTOOD AMERICA AS A 
SACRED TRUST AND UNDERSTOOD OUR 
PUBLIC DEMANDS RESPONSIBILITIES 
EVEN BEFORE IT DEFENDS ITS 
RIGHTS. 
HE KNEW NAVIGATING THE LINE 
BETWEEN GOOD AND EAGLE -- EVIL 
WAS OFTEN DIFFICULT BUT ALWAYS 
SIMPLE. 
HE GRASPED THAT OUR PURPOSE AND 
MEANING WAS ROOTED IN A 
MISSIONARY'S RESPONSIBILITY 
STRETCHING BACK CENTURIES.  
JUST AS THE FIRST AMERICANS 
LOOKED UPON A NEW WORLD FULL OF 
POTENTIAL FOR A GRAND 
EXPERIMENT IN FREEDOM AND SELF-
GOVERNMENT, SO DO THEIR 
DESCENDENTS HAVE THE 
RESPONSIBILITY TO DEFEND THE 
OLD WORLD FROM IT'S WORTH SELF. 
THE AMERICA OF JOHN McCAIN  IS 
THE AMERICA OF REVOLUTION. 
FIGHTERS WITH NO STOMACH FOR 
THE SUNSHINE PATRIOT MAKING THE 
WORLD A NEW WITH THE BELLS OF 
LIBERTY. 
THE AMERICA OF JOHN McCAIN IS 
THE AMERICA  OF ABRAHAM 
LINCOLN.  
FULFILLING THE PROMISE OF THE 
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE 
THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL 
AND SUFFERING GREATLY TO SEE IT 
THROUGH. 
THE AMERICA OF JOHN McCAIN IS 
THE AMERICA OF THE BOYS WHO 
RUSHED  THE COLORS IN EVERY WAR 
ACROSS THREE CENTURIES KNOWING 
THAT IN THEM IS THE LIFE OF THE 
REPUBLIC.  
PARTICULARLY THOSE BY THEIR 
DARING AS RONALD REAGAN SAID, 
GAVE UP THEIR CHANCE AT BEING 
HUSBANDS AND FATHERS AND 
GRANDFATHRS AND TO BE REVERED 
OLD MEN. 
THE AMERICA OF JOHN McCAIN IS, 
YES, THE AMERICA OF VIETNAM , 
FIGHTING THE FIGHT EVEN IN THE 
MOST FOR LONG CAUSE IN GRIM 
CIRCUMSTANCES AND EVEN IN THE 
MOST DISTANT AND HOSTILE CORNER 
OF THE WORLD.  
STANDING IN DEFEAT FOR THE LIFE 
AND LIBERTIES OF OTHER PEOPLES 
IN OTHER LANDS. 
THE AMERICA OF JOHN McCAIN IS 
GENEROUS AND WELCOMING AND 
BOLD.  
SHE IS RESOURCEFUL AND 
CONFIDENT AND SECURE. 
SHE MEETS HER RESPONSIBILITIES. 
SHE SPEAKS QUIETLY BECAUSE SHE 
IS STRONG. 
AMERICA DOES NOT VOTE BECAUSE 
SHE HAS NO NEED TO. 
THE AMERICA OF JOHN McCAIN  HAS 
NO NEED TO BE MADE GREAT AGAIN 
BECAUSE AMERICA WAS ALWAYS 
GREAT.  
>>  
>> THAT FERVENT FAITH, PROVEN 
DEVOTION, ABIDING LOVE IS WHAT 
DROVE MY FATHER FROM THE FIERY 
SKIES ABOVE THE RED RIVER DELTA 
TO THE BRINK OF THE PRESIDENCY 
ITSELF. 
LOVE TO FIND MY FATHER.  
AS A YOUNG MAN HE WONDERED IF 
HE WOULD MEASURE UP TO HIS 
DISTINGUISHED LINEAGE. 
I MISS HIM SO BADLY. 
úI WANT TO 
BUT I TAKE SMALL COMFORT IN 
THIS. 
SOMEWHERE IN THE GREAT BEYOND 
WHERE THE WARRIORS GO, THERE 
ARE TWO ADMIRALS OF THE UNITED 
STATES MEETING THERE MUCH LOVED 
SON TELLING THEM THEY ARE THE 
GREATEST AMONG THEM.  
DAD, I LOVE YOU.  
I ALWAYS HAVE. 
ALL THAT I AM, ALL THAT I HOPE, 
ALL THAT A DREAM IS GROUNDED IN 
WHAT YOU TAUGHT ME. 
YOU LOVED ME AND YOU SHOWED ME 
WHAT LOVE MUST BE. 
AN ANCIENT GREEK HISTORIAN 
WROTE THE IMAGE OF GREAT MEN IS 
WOVEN INTO THE STUFF OF OTHER 
MEN'S LIVES. 
TO HAVE YOUR GREATNESS WOVEN 
INTO MY LIFE, IT IS WOVEN INTO 
MY MOTHER'S LIFE INTO MY 
SISTER'S LIFE AND WOVEN INTO MY 
BROTHERS' LIVES.  
IT IS WOVEN INTO THE LIFE AND 
LIBERTY OF THE COUNTRY YOU 
SACRIFICED SO MUCH TO DEFEND. 
DAD, I KNOW YOU ARE NOT 
PERFECT. 
WE LIVE IN AND ERA WHERE WE 
KNOCKED DOWN OLD AMERICAN 
HEROES FOR ALL THEIR 
IMPERFECTIONS WE KNOW LEADER 
WANTS TO ADMIT DEFAULT OR 
FAILURE. 
YOU WERE AND EXCEPTION AND YOU 
GAVE US AND IDEAL TO STRIVE 
FOR.  
LOOK.  I KNOW YOU CAN SEE THIS 
GATHERING HERE IN THIS 
CATHEDRAL. 
THE NATION IS HERE TO REMEMBER 
YOU.  
LIKE SO MANY OTHER HEROES, YOU 
LEAVE US DRAPED IN THE FLAG YOU 
LOVED. 
YOU DEFENDED IT, SACRIFICED IT, 
ALWAYS HONORED IT'S. 
IT IS GOOD TO REMEMBER WE ARE 
AMERICANS.  
WE DON'T PUT OUR HEROES ON 
PEDESTALS JUST TO REMEMBER 
THEM. 
WE RAISE THEM UP BECAUSE WE 
WANT TO EMULATE THEIR VIRTUES. 
THIS IS HOW WE HONOR THEM AND 
THIS IS HOW WE WILL HONOR YOU.  
MY FATHER IS GONE.  
MY FATHER IS GONE, AND MY 
SORROW IS IMMENSE BUT I KNOW 
HIS LIFE AND I KNOW IT WAS 
GREAT BECAUSE IT WAS GOOD. 
AND AS MUCH AS I HATE TO SEE 
HIM GO, I DO KNOW HOW IT ENDED. 
I KNOW AND ON THE AFTERNOON OF 
AUGUST 25 IN FRONT OF OAK CREEK 
IN CORDELE, ARIZONA SURROUNDED 
BY THE FAMILY HE LOVED IT SO 
MUCH, AN OLD MAN SHOOK OFF THE 
SCARS OF BATTLE ONE LAST TIME 
AND AROSE A NEW MAN.  
TO PILATE ONE LAST FLIGHT UP 
AND UP AND UP BUSTING CLOUDS 
LEFT AND RIGHT STRAIGHT ON 
THROUGH TO THE KINGDOM OF 
HEAVEN.  
AND HE SLIPPED THE EARTHLY 
BONDS, PUT OUT HIS HAND AND 
TOUCHED THE FACE OF GOD.  
I LOVE YOU, DAD.  
>> 
>> FROM WORKROOM BY ROBERT 
LOUIS STEVENSON.  
UNDER THE WIDE AND STARRY SKY, 
DIG A GRAVE IN LET ME LIKE.  
CLEARLY THAT I LIVE AND GLADLY 
DID I DIE AND I LAID ME DOWN 
WITH THE WILL.  
BE THIS DIVERSE C
HERE HE LIES WITH YOU LONG TO 
BE. 
HOME IS THE SAILOR, HOME FROM 
THE SEA AND THE HUNTER HOME 
FROM THE HILL.
>>> MY COUNTRY TIS 
OF THEE, SWEET LAND OF LIBERTY, 
OF THEE I SING. 
LAND WHERE MY FATHERS DIED! 
LAND OF THE PILGRIM'S PRIDE! 
FROM EVERY MOUNTAIN SIDE, LET 
FREEDOM RING! 
MY NATIVE COUNTRY, THEE, LAND 
OF THE NOBLE FREE, THY NAME I 
LOVE. 
I LOVE THY ROCKS AND RILLS, THY 
WOODS AND TEMPLED HILLS; MY 
HEART WITH RAPTURE FILLS LIKE 
THAT ABOVE. 
LET MUSIC SWELL THE BREEZE, AND 
RING FROM ALL THE TREES SWEET 
FREEDOM'S SONG. 
LET MORTAL TONGUES AWAKE; LET 
ALL THAT BREATHE PARTAKE; LET 
ROCKS THEIR SILENCE BREAK, THE 
SOUND PROLONG. 
OUR FATHER'S GOD TO, THEE, 
AUTHOR OF LIBERTY, TO THEE WE 
SING. 
LONG MAY OUR LAND BE BRIGHT 
WITH FREEDOM'S HOLY LIGHT; 
PROTECT US BY THY MIGHT, GREAT 
GOD, OUR KING! 
>> CINDY McCAIN AND A WONDERFUL 
McCAIN FAMILY, PRESIDENTS BUSH, 
OBAMA AND THE OTHER GUESTS, 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BECOMING 
JOHN McCAIN'S FRIEND IS ONE OF 
THE GREAT BLESSINGS OF MY LIFE. 
BEING ASKED  TO PAY TRIBUTE TO 
HIM TODAY IS ONE OF THE GREAT 
HONORS AND FOR THAT, I THINK 
CINDY McCAIN AND THE ENTIRE 
McCAIN FAMILY AND I ALSO WANT 
TO THANK THEM.  
INCLUDING HIS MOTHER, BROTHER, 
SISTER AND HIS SEVEN WONDERFUL 
CHILDREN FOR THE LOVE AND 
SUPPORT YOU GAVE JOHN 
THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE AND HIS 
SERVICE. 
NONE MORE THAN IN THE LAST YEAR 
OF HIS LIFE. 
AND YOU, CINDY, HAS BEEN 
ABSOLUTELY SAINTLY AND WE, HIS 
FRIENDS, CANNOT THANK YOU 
ENOUGH.  
THERE'S A SPECIAL SATISFACTION 
THAT COMES FROM SERVING A CAUSE 
GREATER THAN YOURSELF. 
I HEARD JOHN SAY THOSE WORDS 
HUNDREDS OF TIMES.  
PARTICULARLY TO YOUNG PEOPLE 
AND YOU HEARD THEM LOT LOT -- A 
LOT BUT FOR HIM, THEY WERE NOT 
JUST WORDS IN A SPEECH BUT 
DECREED HE LIVED BY. 
AND THE GREATER CAUSE TO WHICH 
HE DEVOTED HIS LIFE WAS 
AMERICA.  
NOT SO MUCH THE COUNTRY DEFINED 
BY ITS BORDERS BUT THE AMERICA 
OF OUR FOUNDING VALUES, 
FREEDOM, HUMAN RIGHTS, 
OPPORTUNITY, DEMOCRACY, AND 
EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW.  
HE NOBLY SERVED AND ADVANCED 
THESE AMERICAN VALUES AND 
REMARKABLY HIS DEATH SEEMS TO 
HAVE REMINDED THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE THAT THESE VALUES ARE 
WHAT MAKES US A GREAT NATION.  
NOT THE TRIBAL PARTISANSHIP AND 
PERSONAL ATTACK POLITICS THAT 
HAVE RECENTLY CHARACTERIZED OUR 
LIFE. 
THIS WEEK CELEBRATION OF THE 
LIFE AND VALUES AND PATRIOTISM 
OF THIS HERO, I THINK YOU'VE 
TAKEN OUR COUNTRY ABOVE ALL 
THAT. 
IN A WAY, IT'S THE LAST GREAT 
GIFT THAT JOHN McCAIN GAVE 
AMERICA.   
I WANT TO SUGGEST TODAY WE CAN 
GIVE A LAST GREAT GIFT TO TO 
HIM, WHICH IS TO NURTURE THESE 
VALUES AND TAKE THEM FORWARD 
INTO THE YEARS AHEAD TO MAKE 
AMERICA THE BETTER COUNTRY JOHN 
ALWAYS KNEW IT COULD BE.  
I PRAY THAT WE WILL, AND I ASK 
YOU TO DO SO, AS WELL.  
LET ME TRY TO PAY TRIBUTE TO 
THIS GREAT MAN BY DESCRIBING 
AND SHARING STORIES FROM OUR 
FRIENDSHIP WHICH BEGAN IN THE 
EARLY 1990S AS PART OF A 
BIPARTISAN GROUP PUSHING OUR 
GOVERNMENT TO STOP THE 
AGGRESSION AND SLAUGHTER IN 
BOSNIA. 
WE BEGAN TO COLLABORATE ON A 
LOT OF BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION.  
BUT REALLY OUR FRIENDSHIP 
DEEPENED IN OUR TRAVELS 
TOGETHER AROUND THE WORLD WITH 
OUR THIRD AMIGO, LINDSEY 
GRAHAM. 
WHEN YOU TRAVELED WITH JOHN, 
EVEN WITH LINDSEY GRAHAM ALONG, 
THE PURPOSE WAS NOT TO HAVE 
FUN. 
IN FACT, SOMETIMES IT SEEMS THE 
PURPOSE WAS JUST TO SURVIVE THE 
SCHEDULE HE HAD ORGANIZED.  
HE HAD A RESTLESS ENERGY EVERY 
DAY INCLUDING THE DAYS WE WOULD 
TRAVEL TO GET THE MOST OUT OF 
EVERY DAY HE POSSIBLY COULD, 
AND HE DID. 
AND SO DID WE WHO WERE 
PRIVILEGED TO KNOW HIM. 
JOHN TRAVELED TO LEARN SO HE 
COULD BE A BETTER SENATOR. 
HE TRAVELED TO REPRESENT 
AMERICA AS BEST HE COULD, 
WHEREVER WE WENT, AND HE DID 
AND HE TRAVELED TO SUPPORT THE 
MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR ARMED 
SERVICES WEATHER IN WAR OR AT 
PEACE WHEREVER THEY WERE AND 
THEY, IN TURN, WELCOMED HIM IN 
NOT JUST RESPECT BUT AWE AS THE 
HERO JOHN McCAIN WAS, IS, AND 
ALWAYS WILL BE. 
IN SHARED EXPERIENCES AND LONG 
CONVERSATIONS, ON THESE TRIPS, 
WE GOT TO KNOW AND TRUST EACH 
OTHER AS FRIENDS IN A WAY THAT 
DOESN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE IT CAN'T 
HAPPEN MUCH ANYMORE IN THE 
FRENETIC WASHINGTON LIFE OF 
SENATORS.  
OUR FRIENDSHIP TAUGHT ME MANY 
THINGS INCLUDING I MUST ADD, 
SOME JOKES THAT I OTHERWISE 
NEVER WOULD HAVE KNOWN. 
>>  
>> JOHN LOVED TO LAUGH AND MAKE 
OTHERS LAUGH.  
WHEN HE FOUND A JOKE THAT 
PEOPLE LIKED, HE TOLD IT OVER 
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  
ONE OF MY FAVORITES WAS ABOUT 
THE TWO INMATES GOING THROUGH 
THE FOOD LINE FOR DINNER AT THE 
STATE PENITENTIARY.  
ONE SAYS TO THE OTHER, THE FOOD 
IS TERRIBLE HERE.  
THE OTHER SAYS, IT WAS A LOT 
BETTER WHEN I WAS GOVERNOR.  
>>  
>>  
>> YEAH. 
I HEARD THAT ONE OFTEN AND I 
LAUGHED EVERY TIME BECAUSE JOHN 
LAUGHED SO HARD EVERY TIME HE 
TOLD IT. 
THE RANGE OF HIS MIND, 
INTEREST, AND EXPERIENCE WAS 
IMPRESSIVE AND OFTEN SURPRISING.
YOU COULDN'T CHARACTERIZE THIS 
MAN. 
HE LOVED TO READ HISTORY, 
FICTION, AND TO TALK ABOUT IT, 
ARGUE ABOUT IT. 
HE HAD A PERVASIVE CURIOSITY 
ABOUT EVERYTHING IN LIFE.  
HE LOVED THE OUTDOORS AND ALL 
OF GOD'S CREATURES, LARGE AND 
SMALL WHO LIVED THERE. 
MOST PEOPLE WOULD BE SURPRISED 
BY HOW MUCH PLEASURE THIS 
COMBATIVE SENATOR GOT FROM 
WATCHING THE HUMMINGBIRDS AT 
THE McCAIN FAMILY HOME OUTSIDE 
SEDONA, ARIZONA. 
HIS GREAT STRENGTH, OF COURSE, 
WAS HIS CHARACTER. 
HE WAS HONEST, FAIR, AND A 
CIVILIZED.  
IN ALL THE TIMES WE WERE 
TOGETHER, I NEVER HEARD HIM SAY 
A BIGOTED WORD ABOUT ANYONE. 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAW THIS 
GREAT QUALITY MOST CLEARLY 
DURING THE 2000 CAMPAIGN WHEN 
THAT WOMAN MADE AN OFFENSIVE 
STATEMENT AGAINST THEN SENATOR 
BARACK OBAMA.  
TO ME WHAT WAS MOST IMPRESSIVE 
ABOUT JOHN'S REACTION WAS THAT 
IT WAS PURE REFLEX. 
IT WAS WHO JOHN WAS. 
HE DIDN'T NEED TO CONSULT 
ANYONE AND IMMEDIATELY DEFENDED 
HIS OPPONENT'S NAME AND HONOR 
AND THEREBY ELEVATED FOR THAT 
MOMENT, OUR POLITICS AND MADE 
US A MORE PERFECT UNION.  
PERSONALLY I COULD TELL YOU 
THAT JOHN WAS A REAL FRIEND AND 
ACCOMMODATING WHAT TO HIM -- 
WHAT TO HIM WHERE MY UNUSUAL 
PRACTICES AS A RELIGIOUSLY 
OBSERVANT JEW WHETHER WORKING 
WITH ME ON A SATURDAY TO AN 
IMPORTANT MEETING OR TURNING 
DOWN A POPULAR FRIDAY NIGHT 
DINNER INVITATION AT THE MUNICH 
SECURITY CONFERENCE WE WENT TO 
EVERY YEAR BECAUSE IT WAS TOO 
FAR TO WALK, WE WOULD STAY IN 
THE HOTEL AND HAVE WHAT JOHN 
LEARNED TO CALL OUR SO LOAN 
DINNERS. 
PEACEFUL SABBATH DINNERS. 
JOHN NATURALLY IN DOING THESE 
WONDERFUL ACTS OF FRIENDSHIP 
RUMBLED ALL THE WAY ABOUT WHAT 
I WAS PUTTING HIM THROUGH. 
RIGHT NOW I THINK HE'S PROBABLY 
DERIVING SOME PLEASURE FROM THE 
FACT IT TURNED OUT HIS FUNERAL 
WAS HELD ON A SATURDAY AND I 
HAD TO WALK TO GET HERE. 
>>  
>> I'M SURE HE WOULD TELL ME 
THAT WAS DIVINE JUSTICE.  
HE ULTIMATELY, AS HE DID WITH 
SO MUCH OF HIS LIFE, TURNED 
THESE INTERFAITH EXPERIENCES 
INTO A TRULY HILARIOUS COMEDY 
ROUTINE. 
IT BEGAN WITH A SOLEMN 
PRONOUNCEMENT BY JOHN THAT HE 
WAS CONVERTING TO JUDAISM. 
THEN HE EXPLAINED MUCH LESS 
SOLEMNLY, I DO THIS NOT BECAUSE 
OF ANY PARTICULAR LIKING FOR 
THE RELIGION.  
IT'S JUST THAT FOR SO MANY 
YEARS I'VE HAD TO GO ALONG WITH 
ALL OF JOE'S RELIGIOUS NONSENSE 
THAT I MIGHT AS WELL CONVERT 
AND GET THE BENEFITS. 
>>  
>> ONE OF HIS FAVORITE TARGETS 
WAS THE SABBATH ELEVATORS IN 
ISRAELI HOTELS WHICH ARE 
PREPROGRAMMED TO STOP AT EVERY 
FLOOR. 
JOHN HAD MANY VIRTUES BUT 
PATIENTS WAS NOT ONE OF THEM -- 
PATIENCE WAS NOT ONE OF THEM. 
THEREFORE THOSE RIDES ON THE 
ELEVATORS WERE NOT THE HAPPIEST 
TIMES SPENT TOGETHER.  
I SAY THIS BOTH TO SAY IN 
STORIES, HOW FULL AND GENUINE 
WAS HIS ACCEPTANCE OF MY 
RELIGIOUS PRACTICES, WHICH WERE 
DIFFERENT FROM WHAT HE KNEW, 
BUT ALSO TO MAKE A LARGER 
POINTS BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU, 
EVERYTHING WE DID TOGETHER IN 
THE WORLD, WASHINGTON, AND 
ACROSS AMERICA, HE SHOWED THE 
SAME ACCEPTANCE, RESPECT, 
CURIOSITY ABOUT EVERYBODY'S 
RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES AND ABOUT 
EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT THEM THAT 
WAS DIFFERENT FROM HIMSELF AND 
HIS OWN EXPERIENCES.  
I'VE SAID THAT PATIENCE WAS ONE 
VIRTUE JOHN DIDN'T HAVE. 
FORGIVENESS WAS A GREAT VIRTUE 
HE DID HAVE AND HERE'S A STORY. 
ON A TRIP TO HANOI AS WE WERE 
TOURING THE HANOI HILTON, A 
CROWD OF VIETNAMESE COLLEGE 
STUDENTS RECOGNIZED JOHN AND 
THEY BEGAN TO CHANT WILDLY. 
McCAIN, McCAIN.  
THEY WANTED TO TAKE HIS PICTURE 
AND SIGN AUTOGRAPHS.  
I ASKED HIM WHY HE GOT SUCH A 
ROCK STAR RECEPTION IN HANOI 
AND WITH CLASSIC DIRECTNESS HE 
SAID, FIRST OF ALL IT'S BECAUSE 
THEY'VE BEEN TAUGHT THAT I WAS 
TREATED A LOT BETTER HERE THAN 
I REALLY WAS.  
AND THE SECOND IT'S BECAUSE OF 
THE NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS 
BETWEEN THE U.S. AND VIETNAM.  
THAT WAS A CLASSIC McCAIN 
UNDERSTATEMENT. 
ALONG WITH PRESIDENT CLINTON 
AND JOHN KERRY, JOHN McCAIN WAS 
THE LEADER IN CONGRESS IN 
BRINGING ABOUT THE 
NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS 
BETWEEN THE USA AND VIETNAM.  
AN EXTRAORDINARY ACT OF 
PERSONAL FORGIVENESS.  
WHEN YOU CONSIDER WHAT THE 
VIETNAMESE DID TO HIM, DURING 
HIS 5 1/2 YEARS AS A PRISONER 
OF WAR. 
AFTER HIS INJURIES IN VIETNAM, 
HE COULD NOT PURSUE HIS 
AMBITIONS IN THE NAVY. 
HE TURNED TO GOVERNMENT SERVICE 
AS IS GREATER AMERICAN CAUSE. 
OF COURSE, I DIDN'T KNOW JOHN 
IN HIS YOUTH BUT I DON'T THINK 
HE WAS BORN WITH THE NATURAL 
SKILLS OF A LEGISLATURE AND YET 
HE LEARNED THEM AND BECAME A 
GREAT ONE. 
HE KNEW WHEN TO BE IRASCIBLE 
AND IMMOVABLE AND WHEN TO 
NEGOTIATE AND COMPROMISE TO GET 
SOMETHING DONE.  
HE REGULARLY REACHED ACROSS 
PARTY LINES BECAUSE HE KNEW 
THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO SOLVE 
PROBLEMS AND SEIZE 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PEOPLE OF 
OUR COUNTRY AND HIS STATE. 
AS A RESULT, HIS LEGISLATIVE 
RECORD IS EXTREMELY IMPRESSIVE. 
HE ALSO FOUGHT AND LOST SOME 
BIG BATTLES.  
TO STOP CLIMATE CHANGE, CLOSE 
THE GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE, BROADLY 
REFORM OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS.  
THAT NEVER SEEMED TO GET HIM 
DOWN OR DIMINISH HIS ARDOR FOR 
THE NEXT BATTLE.  
HE LOVED TO WIN ALSO LOVED A 
GOOD FIGHT FOR A JUST CAUSE 
EVEN IF IT DIDN'T SUCCEED.  
OVERALL, HE WANTED MANY MORE 
THAN HE LOST AND ALL OF HIS BIG 
WINS WERE ACHIEVED WITH 
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. 
IN 2000 AIDS WHEN JOHN WAS THE 
REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR 
PRESIDENT, HE HAD THIS FAR OUT 
IDEA OF ASKING A DEMOCRAT TO BE 
HIS RUNNING MATE. 
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? 
LET ME EXPLAIN IT.  
WHEN HE FIRST TALKED TO ME 
ABOUT IT, I SAID, I'M REALLY 
HONORED BUT I DON'T SEE HOW YOU 
CAN DO IT.  
EVEN THOUGH I WON MY LAST 
ELECTION AS AN INDEPENDENT, I'M 
STILL A REGISTERED DEMOCRAT. 
HIS RESPONSE WAS DIRECT AND, 
REALLY, ENNOBLING. THAT'S THE 
POINT, JOE, HE SAID WITH A 
CERTAIN IMPATIENCE. 
YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT. 
I'M A REPUBLICAN. 
WE COULD GIVE OUR COUNTRY THE 
BIPARTISAN LEADERSHIP IT NEEDS 
IT FOR A CHANGE.  
WHEN JOHN RETURNED TO THE 
SENATE AFTER HIS SURGERY LAST 
SUMMER AND VOTED AGAINST THE 
REPUBLICAN HEALTH CARE BILL, 
SOME PEOPLE ACCUSED HIM OF 
BEING DISLOYAL TO HIS PARTY AND 
THE PRESIDENT. 
BUT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE.  
IF YOU LISTEN TO THE SPEECH HE 
GAVE THAT DAY YOU WILL KNOW IT 
WAS NOT THE CASE AND THAT 
SPEECH MADE CLEAR HIS VOTE WAS 
NOT REALLY AGAINST THAT BILL 
BUT AGAINST THE MINDLESS 
PARTISANSHIP THAT HAS TAKEN 
CONTROL OF BOTH OF OUR 
POLITICAL PARTIES AND OUR 
GOVERNMENT AND PRODUCED TOTALLY 
ONE-SIDED RESPONSES TO 
COMPLICATED NATIONAL PROBLEMS 
LIKE HEALTHCARE.  
AND OF COURSE HE WAS RIGHT.  
HIS REMARKS LAST JULY ALSO 
SPOKE ELOQUENTLY OF OUR 
POSITION IN THE WORLD OF 
AMERICA'S CONTINUING 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR PRINCIPAL 
LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD AND IT 
WAS AS IF HE THOUGHT THAT MIGHT 
BE ONE OF HIS LAST BEST 
OPPORTUNITIES TO MOVE HIS 
COLLEAGUES AND HIS COUNTRY.  
IT'S A SPEECH WORTH READING BUT 
I JUST WANT TO QUOTE ONE 
SENTENCE.  
WHAT GREATER CAUSE COULD WE 
HOPE TO SERVE THAN HELPING KEEP 
AMERICA STRONG, INSPIRING 
BEACON OF LIBERTY AND DIGNITY 
AND DEFENDER OF THE DIGNITY OF 
ALL HUMAN BEINGS.  
THAT, IN SHORT, WAS THE McCAIN 
AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY.  
MORAL, ENGAGED, AND A STRONG.  
THESE WORDS WERE NOT JUST 
RHETORIC FOR JOHN. 
HE ACTED ON THEM, LIVED TO THEM 
AND IN OUR TRAVELS AROUND THE 
WORLD, HE ALWAYS REASSURED OUR 
ALLIES AND UNSETTLED OUR 
ENEMIES. 
STANDING FOR AMERICA'S BEST 
VALUES. 
ATTACKING TOTALITARIAN 
GOVERNMENTS WEATHER IN MOSCOW, 
TEHRAN, PYONGYANG OR ANYWHERE 
ELSE. 
IF WE WERE GOING TO A COUNTRY 
THAT WAS NOT FULLY FREE, JOHN 
INSISTED THAT WE MEET WITH THE 
LOCAL HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS AS 
WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT.  
I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT DAY 
DURING THE MILITARY 
DICTATORSHIP WE MET THREE MEN 
WHO HAD JUST BEEN RELEASED FROM 
POLITICAL PRISON AND SHOWED 
TERRIBLE SIGNS OF PHYSICAL AND 
PSYCHOLOGICAL ABUSE. 
THEY TOLD US THAT THEY WOULD 
NEVER HAVE SURVIVED IF THEY HAD 
NOT HEARD IN JAIL THAT THE 
GREAT AMERICAN SENATOR JOHN 
McCAIN HAS SUPPORTED THEIR 
CAUSE, READ THEIR NAMES ON THE 
U.S. SENATE FLOOR AND DEMANDED 
THEIR RELEASE.  
ON ANOTHER OCCASION, WE VISITED 
A REFUGEE CAMP FOR SYRIANS WHO 
HAD BEEN FORCED AT OF THEIR 
COUNTRY INTO TURKEY BY THE 
BRUTAL AGGRESSION OF THE 
IRANIANS AND RUSSIANS.  
WE WERE THE FIRST MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS TO VISIT THAT CAMP AND 
THERE WAS SOME CONCERN ABOUT 
THE RECEPTION WE WOULD RECEIVE. 
EARLIER IN THE DAY, IN FACT, AN 
OFFICIAL OF THE U.N. HAD BEEN 
THERE AND HAS SHOES THROWN AT 
THEM. 
WHEN WE ARRIVED, A LARGE CROWD 
OF SYRIAN REFUGEES WAS 
CHANTING. 
BUT RATHER THAN BOOING AND 
THROWING SHOES, THEY WERE 
CHEERING AND CHEERING AND 
CHANTING WORDS OF WELCOME AND 
THANKS AND THE TWO WORDS THEY 
CHANTED MOST WERE, JOHN McCAIN. 
WHAT IS MOST REMARKABLE ABOUT 
THESE TWO STORIES IS HOW 
UNREMARKABLE HOW THEY ARE 
BECAUSE THE NAME JOHN McCAIN 
BASED ON THE ACTIONS OF THE MAN 
JOHN McCAIN HAD BECOME A SOURCE 
OF HOPE AND INSPIRATION  FOR 
OPPRESSED PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE 
WORLD.  
AS IT WAS A SOURCE OF SECURITY 
FOR ALLIED COUNTRIES THAT SHARE 
OUR VALUES. 
ONE OF HIS FAVORITE CITIES IN 
THE WORLD WAS JERUSALEM. 
ONE OF HIS FAVORITE THINGS TO 
DO WAS TO STAND ON THE BALCONY 
WITH LINDSEY GRAHAM AND ME 
LOOKING OUT AT THE OLD CITY AND 
DISCUSSING ALL OF THE RELIGIOUS 
AND POLITICAL HISTORY THAT HAD 
HAPPENED. 
WHEN I FIRST TOLD JOHN THAT I 
HAD DECIDED NOT TO RUN FOR THE 
SENATE AGAIN IN 2012, HE WAS 
PUZZLED AND, FRANKLY, EVEN A 
LITTLE BIT ANGRY.  
THE NEXT DAY HE CALLED ME.  
THIS IS MY BEST RECOLLECTION OF 
THE CONVERSATION. 
I'VE BEEN THINKING, IF YOU GO 
OUT INTO THE PRIVATE SECTOR, 
YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE SOME MORE 
MONEY AND THEN YOU AND HADASSAH 
CAN AFFORD TO BUY A SECOND HOME 
IN JERUSALEM THAT HAS ANNEXED A 
HOME FOR ME. 
WITH A BALCONY. 
WE COULD LOOK OUT AND TALK 
ABOUT THAT CITY AND ITS 
HISTORY.  
SINCE THEN, WHEN I TALKED TO 
JOHN VISITED WITH HIM, HE WOULD 
ASK ME, JOEY, HAVE YOU MADE 
ENOUGH MONEY YET TO BUY THAT 
PLACE IN JERUSALEM? 
 
I WOULD ANSWER NOT YET BUT I'M 
GETTING CLOSER.
. 
>>> AND IT IS TO THAT HEAVENLY 
WHERE I AM CONFIDENT THE SOUL 
OF JOHN SIDNEY McCAIN III IS 
GOING NOW.  
AND I WANT TO IMAGINE THAT 
THERE'S GOING TO BE A BEAUTIFUL 
HOME WAITING FOR HIM THERE.    
WITH A BALCONY  FROM WHICH HE 
CAN CONTEMPLATE  THE SHINING 
CITY.     
HOPEFULLY INSPIRE US HERE ON 
EARTH TO CONDUCT OURSELVES WITH 
JUST SOME OF THE PATRIOT TIM, 
PINS HES, AND COURAGE THAT 
CHARACTERIZE HIS MAGNIFICENT 
LIFE OF SERVICE TO AMERICA AND 
TO SO MANY  NOBLE CAUSES 
GREATER THAN HIMSELF. 
GODSPEED DEAR FELONY,MAY ANGELS 
SING YOU TO YOUR ETEETERNAL 
HOME.      
. 
>>> OUR COUNTRY HAS HAD THE 
GOOD FORTUNE THAT AT TIMES OF 
NATIONAL TRIAL A FEW GREAT 
PERSONALITIES HAVE EMERGED TO 
REMIND US  OF OUR ESSENTIAL 
UNITY AND INSPIRED US TO FULFILL
OUR SUSTAINING VALUES.     
JOHN McCAIN WAS ONE OF THOSE 
GIFTS  OF DESTINY.      
I MET JOHN  FOR THE FIRST TIME  
IN APRIL 1973.      
AT A WHITE HOUSE RECEPTION FOR 
PRISONERS  RETURNED FROM 
CAPTIVITY  IN VIETNAM.     
HE HAD BEEN MUCH ON MY MIND  
DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS TO END 
SLEET HE TELL UNANIMOUS WAR.    
PROUDLY ALSO BECAUSE HIS FATHER 
THEN COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE 
PACIFIC COMMAND  WHEN BRIEFING 
THE PRESIDENT  AND REFERENCES 
TO HIS SON BY SAYING ONLY  I 
PRAY FOR HIM.      
IN THE McCAIN FAMILY NATIONAL 
SERVICE  WAS ITS OWN REWARD.    
THEY DID NOT ALLOW  FOR SPECIAL 
TREATMENT.     
I THOUGHT OF THAT  WHEN HIS 
VIETNAMESE CAN'T TWICE DURING 
THE PHASE OF NEGOTIATIONS 
OFFERED TO RELIEVE JOHN SO THAT 
HE COULD RETURN WITH ME ON THE 
OFFICIAL PLANE THAT HAD BROUGHT 
ME TO HANOI AGAINST ALL MY 
INSTINCT, I THANKED HIM FOR THE 
OFFER, BUT REFUSED IT.      
I WONDERED WHAT JOHN WOULD SAY  
WHEN WE FINALLY  MET.    
THANK YOU FOR SAVING MY HONOR.  
HE DID NOT TELL ME THEN  OR 
EVER THAT HE HAD HAD AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO BE FREED  YEARS 
EARLIER. 
BUT HAD REFUSED.    
A DECISION FOR WHICH HE HAD TO 
ENDURE ADDITIONAL PERIODS OF 
ISOLATION  AND HARDSHIP.    
NOR DID HE EVER  SPEAK OF HIS 
CAPTIVITY AGAIN.     
DURING THE NEAR HALF CENTURY  
OF CLOSE FRIENDSHIP.      
JOHN'S FOCUS WAS ON CREATING A 
BETTER FUTURE AS A SENATOR HE 
SUPPORTED THE RESTORATION OF 
RELATIONS WITH VIETNAM, HELPED 
BRING IT ABOUT ON A BIPARTISAN 
PHASES IN THE CLINTON 
ADMINISTRATION AND BECAME ONE 
OF THE ADVOCATES OF 
RECONCILIATION WITH HIS -- 
ENEMY.     
HONOR WAS JOHN'S --. 
IT IS AN INTANGIBLEQUALITY, IT 
IS NOT  OBLIGATORY. 
IT HAS NO WRITTEN CODE. 
IT REFLECTS AN INWARD 
COMPULSION FREE OF SELF 
INTERESTS.     
IT FULFILLS  A CAUSE  NOT A 
PERSONAL AMBITION.     
IT REPRESENTS  WHAT A SOCIETY 
LIVES FOR  BEYOND THE 
NECESSITIES OF THE MOMENT.     
LAW MAKES LIFE POSSIBLE.      
HONOR AND NOBLETY. 
FORJOHN IT WAS A WAY OF LIFE.   
JOHN RETURNED TO AN AMERICA 
DIVIDED OVER ITS PRESIDENCY, 
DIVIDED OVER THE WAR, AMIDST 
ALL THE TURMOIL DIVIDED OVER 
THE BEST WAY TO PROTECT OUR 
COUNTRY  AND KNOW WHETHER IT 
SHOULD BE RESPECTED FOR ITS 
POWER OR ITS IDEALS.     
JOHN CAME BACK FROM THE WAR  
AND DECLARED THAT THIS IS A 
FALSE CHOICE. 
AMERICA OWED IT TOITSELF  TO 
EMBRACE  BOTH STRENGTHS AND 
IDEALS.     
IN DECADES OF CONGRESSIONAL 
SERVICE ULTIMATELY AS CHAIRMAN 
OF THE SENATE ARMS SERVICES 
COMMITTEE JOHN WAS AN EXPONENT 
OF AN AMERICA  STRONG ENOUGH  
TO VINDICATE  ITS PURPOSE.      
BUT JOHN BELIEVED ALSO  IN A 
COMPASSIONATE AMERICA  GOVERNED 
-- GUIDED BY CORE PRINCIPLES 
FOR WHICH AMERICAN FOREIGN 
POLICY  MUST ALWAYS STAND.     
WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR 
ALL IS NOT AN EMPTY SENTIMENT 
HE ARGUED.    
IT IS -- OF OUR NATIONAL 
CONSCIOUS. 
TO JOHN AMERICAN -- HAD 
UNIVERSAL APPLICABILITY. 
I DO NOT BELIEVEHE SAID THERE 
IS AN EXCEPTION ANY MORE THAN 
THERE IS A -- EX ACCEPTS OR AN 
ASIAN OR LATIN EXCEPTION.     
HE WON AGAINST THE TEMPTATION OF
WITHDRAWAL FROM --.  
OUR LEADERSHIP AND IDEALS ARE 
ABSENT. 
WE WOULD NOT DESERVEIT.      
IN THIS MANNER, JOHN McCAIN'S 
NAME BECAME SYNONYMOUS  WITH AN 
AMERICA THAT REACHED OUT  TO 
OBLIGUE THE POWERFUL -- AND 
GIVE HOPE TO THE OPPRESSED.     
JOHN WITH WILL -- HE WAS IN THE 
FRONT LINES OF ALL THESE -- FOR 
DECENCY AND FREEDOM. 
HE WAS AN ENGAGEDWARRIOR.    
FIGHTING FOR HIS CAUSES WITH 
COURAGE AND WITH HUMILITY TO 
THE LIMIT OF THE FEASIBLE.     
AND SOMETIMES MIRACULOUSLY. 
JOHNWAS ALL ABOUT HOPE.     
IN A COMMENCEMENT SPEECH JOHN 
SUMMED UP  THE ESSENCE OF ITS 
ENGAGEMENT OF A LIFETIME.     
NO ONE OF US   IF THEY HAVE 
CHARACTER  LEAVES BEHIND  A 
WASTED LIFE.     
LIKE MOST PEOPLE  OF MY AGE I 
FEEL A LONGING FOR WHAT IS LOST 
AND CANNOT BE RESTORED.  
BUT IF -- BEAUTY OF YOUTH -- 
SOMETHING BETTER CAN ENDURE.    
AND ENDURE UNTIL OUR LAST 
MOMENTS.      
AND THAT IS  THE --   AND THE 
LOVING GIFT AND A MOMENT IN OUR 
LIVES WHEN WE SACRIFICE FOR 
SOMETHING  GREATER.    
THAN OURSELVES.      
HEROES, INSIDE EXPIRE US, BY 
THE MATTER OF FACTNESS  OF 
THEIR SACRIFICE.     
AND THE ELEVATION OF THEIR 
VISION. THE WORLD WILL BE 
LONELIER WITHOUT JOHN McCAIN. 
FORE   HIS FAITH IN AMERICA,  
AND HIS INSTINCT ACTIVE SENSE 
OF MORAL DUTY.      
NONE OF US  WILL EVER FORGET  
HOW EVEN IN HIS PARTING JOHN 
HAS RESTORED ON US A MUCH 
NEEDED MOMENT OF UNITY.   
AND A RENEWED FAITH IN THE 
PROBABILITIES OF AMERICA.     
HENCEFORTH THE COUNTRY'S HONOR 
IS OURS  TO SUSTAIN.      
. 
>>> THE McCAIN FAMILY I AM 
HONORED TO BE WITH YOU TO OFFER 
MY SYMPATHIES AND CELEBRATE A 
GREAT LIFE. 
THE NATION JOINSYOUR 
EXTRAORDINARY FAMILY IN GRIEVE 
AND GRATITUDE FOR JOHN McCAIN.  
SOME LIVES ARE SO VIVID  IT'S 
DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THEM 
ENDED.    
SOME VOICES ARE SO VIBRANT AND 
DISTINCTIVE IT'S HARD TO THINK 
OF THEM --   A MAN WHO SELDOM 
RESTED IS LAID TO REST.      
AND HIS ABSENCE IS TANGIBLE 
LIKE THE SILENCE AFTER A MIGHTY 
ROARING. 
THE THING ABOUT JOHN'SLIFE WAS 
THE AMAZING SWEEP OF IT, FROM A 
TINY PRISON CELL IN VIETNAM TO 
THE FLOOR OF THE UNITED STATES 
SENATE.    
FROM TROUBLE MAKING TO 
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. 
WHEREVER JOHN PASSED THROUGHOUT 
THE WORLD PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY 
KNEW THERE WAS A LEADER IN 
THEIR MIDST. 
ONE EPIC LIFE WASWRITTEN THE 
COURAGE AND GREATNESS OF OUR 
COUNTRY.   
FOR JOHN AND ME THERE WAS A 
PERSON JOURNEY, OUR HARD FOUGHT 
POLITICAL HISTORY. 
BACK IN THEDAY HE COULD 
FRUSTRATE ME.      
AND I KNOW HE'D SAY THE SAME 
THING ABOUT ME.     
BUT HE ALSO MADE ME BETTER.     
IN RECENT YEARS WE SOMETIMES 
TALK OF THAT INTENSE PERIOD 
LIKE FOOTBALL PLAYERS.    
REMEMBERING A BIG GAME. 
IN THE PROCESS RIVALRYMELTED 
AWAY. 
IN THE END I GOTTO ENJOY ONE OF 
LIFE'S GREAT GIFTS, THE 
FRIENDSHIP OF JOHN McCAIN AND 
I'LL MISS HIM. 
MOMENTS BEFORE MY LAST DEBATE 
EVER  WITH SENATOR JOHN KERRY 
IN PHOENIX I WAS TRYING TO 
GATHER SOME THOUGHTS IN THE 
HOLDING ROOM. 
I FELT A PRESENCE, OPENED MY 
EYES  AND 6 INCHES FROM MY FACE 
WAS McCAIN WHO YELLED RELAX, 
RELAX.       
JOHN WAS ABOVE ALL A MAN WITH A 
CODE  PUBLIC VIRTUES THAT 
BROUGHT STRENGTH AND PURPOSE TO 
HIS LIFE AND TO HIS COUNTRY. 
HE WASCOURAGE I COULDN'T SAY 
WITH A COURAGE THAT FLIGHTENED 
TWICE CAP TORNADOS AND INSPIRED 
HIS COUNTRYMEN. 
HE WAS HONEST NOMATTER WHOM IT 
OFFENDED. 
PRESIDENTS WERE NOT SPARED.     
HE WAS HONORABLE, ALWAYS 
RECOGNIZING THAT HIS OPPONENTS 
WERE STILL PATRIOTS AND HUMAN 
BEINGS. 
HELOVED FREEDOM WITH THE 
PASSION OF A MAN WHO KNEW ITS 
ABSENCE. 
HE RESPECTED THE DIGNITY 
INHERIT IN EVERY LIFE, A 
DIGNITY THAT DOES NOT STOP AT 
BORDERS AND CANNOT BE ERASED BY 
DICTATORS. 
PERHAPS OF ALL JOHN PROTESTED 
THE ABUSE OF POWER.     
THERE WAS SOMETHING DEEP INSIDE 
HIM THAT MADE HIM STAND UP FOR 
THE LITTLE GUY TO SPEAK FOR 
FORGOTTEN PEOPLE AND FORGOTTEN 
PLACES.      
WHEN FRIEND FROM HIS NAVAL 
ACADEMY DAYS RECALLS WHILE JOHN 
REACTED TO SEEING AN 
UPPERCLASSMAN VERBALLY ABUSE A 
STEWARD. 
AGAINST ALL TRADITIONHE TOLD 
THE JERK TO PICK ON SOMEONE HIS 
OWN SIZE. 
IT WAS AFAMILIAR REFRAIN DURING 
HIS 6 DECADES OF SERVICE.     
-WORD WHERE DOES SUCH STRENGTH 
AND CONVICTION COME FROM, 
PERHAPS FROM FAMILY WHERE HONOR 
WAS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OR FROM 
THE FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE OF 
CRUELTY WHICH LEFT PHYSICAL 
REMINDERS THAT LASTED HIS WHOLE 
LIFE OR SOME DEEP WE FEEL MORAL 
PRINCIPLE. 
WHATEVER THE CAUSE,IT WAS THIS 
COMBINATION OF COURAGE AND 
DECENCY THAT DEFINED JOHN'S 
CALLING AND SO CLOSELY 
PARALLELED THE CALLING OF HIS 
COUNTRY.     
IT'S THIS COMBINATION OF 
COURAGE AND DECENCY THAT MAKES 
-- AND UNLIVELIED POWER FOR 
GOOD. 
IT'STHIS COMBINATION OF COURAGE 
AND DECENCY THAT SET AMERICA ON 
A JOURNEY INTO THE WORLD TO 
LIBERATE DEATH CAMPS, STAND 
GUARD AGAINST EXTREMISM AND A 
WORK FOR TRUE PEACE THAT COMES 
ONLY WITH FREEDOM. 
JOHN FELTTHESE COMMITMENTS IN 
HIS BONES, IT IS A TRIBUTE TO 
HIS MORAL COMPASS THAT 
PRISONERS IN SO MANY PLACES 
FROM RUSSIA TO NORTH KOREA TO 
CHINA KNEW THAT HE WAS ON THEIR 
SIDE.      
AND I THINK THEIR RESPECT MEANT 
MORE TO HIM  THAN ANY MEDALS 
AND HONORS LIFE COULD BRING.    
THE PASSION FOR FAIRNESS AND 
JUSTICE EXTENDED TO OUR OWN 
MILITARY. 
WHEN A PRIVATE WAS POORLY 
EQUIPPED JOHN ENJOYED NOTHING 
MORE THAN DRESSING DOWN AN 
ADMIRAL OR A GENERAL, HE 
REMAINED A TROUBLESOME -- UNTIL 
THE END. 
THOSE IN POLITICALPOWER WERE 
NOT EXEMPT. 
ATVARIOUS POINTS JOHN 
CONFRONTED POLICIES AND 
PRACTICES HE BELIEVED WERE 
UNWORTHY TO HIS COUNTRY. 
JOHN McCAIN WOULDINSIST WE'RE 
BETTER THAN THIS.   
AMERICA IS BETTER THAN THIS.    
JOHN IS THE FIRST TO TELL YOU 
IS NOT A PERFECT MAN BUT HE 
DEDICATED HIS LIFE TO NATIONAL 
IDEALS THAT ARE AS PERFECT AS 
MEN AND WOMEN HAVE YET 
CONCEIVED. 
HE WASMOTIVATED BY A VISION OF 
AMERICA CARRIED EVER FORWARD 
EVER UPWARD ON THE STRENGTH OF 
ITS PRINCIPLES.     
HE SAW OUR COUNTRY NOT ONLY AS 
A PHYSICAL PLACE OR POWER, BUT 
AS THE CARRIER OF ENDURING 
HUMAN ASPIRATIONS.    
AS AN ADVOCATE FOR THE 
OPPRESSED, AS A DEFENDER OF THE 
PEACE, AS A PROMISE UNWAVERING, 
UNEQUAL.     
THE STRENGTH OF A DEMOCRACY IS 
RENEWED BY REAFFIRMING THE 
PRINCIPLES ON WHICH IT WAS 
FOUNDED. 
ANDAMERICA HAS SOMEHOW ALWAYS 
FOUND LEADERS HONOR UP TO THAT 
TASK PARTICULARLY AT THE TIME 
OF GREATEST NEED. 
JOHN WAS BORN TOMEET THAT KIND 
OF CHALLENGE, TO DEFEND AND 
DEMONSTRATE THE DEFINING IDEA 
Y'ALLS OF OUR NATION.     
FOREVER TEMPTED TO FORGET WHO 
WE ARE, GROW WEARY OF OUR CAUSE 
JOHN'S VOICE WILL ALWAYS COME 
AS A WHISPER OVER OUR SHOULDER. 
WE'RE BETTER THAN THIS. 
AMERICAIS BETTER THAN THIS. 
JOHN WAS ARESTLESS SOUL. 
HE DIDN'T GLORYIN SUCCESS OR 
WALL LOW IN FAILURE BECAUSE HE 
WAS ALL ONTO THE NEXT THING. 
FRIENDS SAID HECAN'T STAY IN 
THE SAME EXPERIENCE. 
ONE OF THE HISBOOKS ENDED WITH 
THE WORDS AND I MOVED ON. 
JOHN HAS MOVED ON.
HE WOULD PROBABLY NOT WANT TO 
US DWELL ON IT BUT BETTER FOR 
HIS PRESENCE AMONG US. 
THE WORLD ISSMALL ARE FOR HIS 
DEPARTURE AND WE'LL REMEMBER 
HIM AS HE WAS, UNWAVERING, 
UNEQUAL.  
TO JOHN'S BELOVED FAMILY, MRS. 
McCAIN, AND THE McCAIN 
CHILDREN,    PRESIDENT, MRS. 
BUSH, VICE PRESIDENT, AND AS 
JOHN WOULD SAY MY FRIENDS.     
WE COME TO CELEBRATE  AN 
EXTRAORDINARY MAN.     
A WARRIOR  A STATESMAN, A 
PATRIOT.      
WHO EMBODIED SO MUCH  THAT IS 
BEST IN AMERICA.      
PRESIDENT BUSH AND I ARE AMONG 
THE FORTUNATE FEW WHO COMPETED 
AGAINST JOHN AT THE HIGHEST 
LEVELS OF POLITICS.  
HE MADE US BETTER PRESIDENTS.   
JUST AS HE MADE THE SENATE 
BETTER.      
JUST AS HE MADE THIS COUNTRY 
BETTER.      
SO FOR SOMEONE LIKE JOHN TO ASK 
YOU WHILE HE'S STILL ALIVE  TO 
STAND AND SPEAK OF HIM WHEN 
HE'S GONE  IS A PRESSURES AND 
SINGULAR HONOR. 
NOW, WHEN JOHNCALLED ME WITH 
THAT REQUEST EARLIER THIS YEAR 
I'LL ADMIT  SADNESS,    AND 
ALSO A CERTAIN SURPRISE.     
BUT AFTER  OUR CONVERSATION 
ENDED I REALIZED HOW WELL IT 
CAPTURED SOME OF JOHN'S 
ESSENTIAL QUALITIES. 
TOSTART WITH JOHN LIKED BEING 
UNPREDICTABLE.      
EVEN A LITTLE CONTRARIAN. 
HE HAD NO INTEREST COULD 
CONFORMING OF SOME PREPACKAGED 
VERSION OF WHAT SOME SENATOR 
SHOULD BE AND DIDN'T WANT A 
MEMORIAL THAT WAS GOING TO BE 
PRE PACKAGED EITHER.      
IT ALSO SHOWED JOHN'S DISDAIN 
FOR SELF PIT TEE.     
HE HAD BEEN TO HELL AND BACK 
AND YET SOMEHOW NEVER LOST  HIS 
ENERGY OR HIS OPTIMISM OR HIS 
ZEST FOR LIFE.   
SO CANCER DID NOT SCARE HIM.    
AND HE WOULD MAINTAIN THAT 
SPIRIT AT THE VERY END, TOO 
STUBBORN TO SIT STILL,  OPINION 
WATERED AS EVER, FIERCELY 
DEVOTED TO HIS FRIENDS AND MOST 
OF ALL TO HIS FAMILY.       
IT SHOWED HIS IRREVERANCE, 
SENSE OF HUMOR, A LITTLE BIT OF 
A -- AFTER ALL WHAT BETTER WAY 
TO GET A LAST LAUGH THAN TO 
MAKE GEORGE AND I SAY NICE 
THINGS ABOUT HIM TO A NATIONAL 
AUDIENCE.      
MOST OF ALL IT SHOWED A 
LARGENESS OF SPIRIT. 
AN ABILITYTO SEE PAST 
DIFFERENCES IN SEARCH OF COMMON 
GROUND.    
AND IN FACT, ON THE SURFACE 
JOHN AND I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN 
MORE DIFFERENT.     
WE'RE OF DIFFERENT GENERATIONS, 
I CAME FROM A BROKEN HOME AND 
NEVER KNEW MY FATHER.     
JOHN WAS THE -- ONE OF 
AMERICA'S MOST -- FAMILIES. 
IHAVE A REPUTATION FOR KEEPING 
COOL,  JOHN NOT SO MUCH.     
WE WERE STANDARD BEARERS OF 
DIFFERENT AMERICAN POLITICAL 
TRADITIONS AND THROUGHOUT MY 
PRESIDENCY JOHN NEVER HESITATED 
TO TELL ME WHEN HE THOUGHT I 
WAS SCREWING UP WHICH BY HIS 
CALCULATION WAS ONCE A DAY.     
BUT FOR ALL OUR DIFFERENCES,  
FOR ALL THE TIMES WE SPARRED, I 
NEVER TRIED TO HIDE AND I THINK 
JOHN  CAME TO UNDERSTAND  THE 
LONG-STANDING ADMIRATION THAT I 
HAD FOR HIM.      
BY HIS ON ACCOUNT JOHN WAS A 
REBEL I COULDN'T SAY YOUNG MAN. 
IN HIS CASE THAT'S
UNDERSTANDABLE WHAT FASTER WAY 
TO DISTINGUISH YOURSELF THAN TO 
MUTINY.  
EVENTUALLY THOUGH HE CONCLUDED 
THAT THE ONLY WAY TO REALLY 
MAKE HIS MARK ON THE WORLD IS 
TO COMMIT  TO SOMETHING BIGGER 
THAN YOURSELF.    
AND FOR JOHN THAT MEANT 
ANSWERING  THE HIGHEST OF 
CALLINGS.     
SERVING HIS COUNTRY  IN A TIME 
OF WAR.      
OTHERS THIS WEEK AND THIS 
MORNING HAVE SPOKEN  TO THE 
DEPTHS OF HIS ORMENT AND THE 
DEPTHS OF HIS COURAGE THERE IN 
THE CELLS OF HANOI WHEN DAY 
AFTER DAY, YEAR AFTER YEAR  THE 
YOUTHFUL IRON WAS TEMPERED INTO 
STEEL.      
AND IT BRINGS TO MIND SOMETHING 
THAT HEMMINGWAY WROTE AND THE 
BROKE REFERRED TO, HIS FAVORITE 
WORK, TODAY ONLY ONE DAY  IN 
ALL THE DAYS THAT WILL EVER BE  
BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN  IN ALL 
THE OTHER DAYS  THAT EVER COME  
CAN DEPEND  ON WHAT  YOU DO 
TODAY.      
IN CAPTIVITY JOHN LEARNED IN 
WAYS THAT FEW OF US EVER WILL 
THE MEANING OF THOSE WORDS.     
HOW EACH MOMENT  EACH DAY  EACH 
JOYCE IS A TEST.      
AND JOHN McCAIN PASSED THAT 
TEST AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. 
AND THAT'S WHY WHEN JOHN SPOKE 
OF VIRTUES LIKE SERVICE AND 
DUTY,  IT DIDN'T RING HOLLOW. 
THEY WEREN'T JUST WORDS TO HIM. 
IT WAS A TRUTH THAT HE HAD 
LIVED.   
AND FOR WHICH  HE WAS PREPARED 
TO DIE.   
AND FORCED EVEN THE MOST  
CYNICAL TO CONSIDER WHAT WERE 
WE DOING FOR OUR COUNTRY? 
WHATMIGHT  WE RISK EVERYTHING 
FOR? 
YOU KNOW, MUCH HAS BEENSAID  
THIS WEEK ABOUT WHAT A  
MAVERICK JOHN WAS. 
NOW, INFACT, JOHN WAS A PRETTY 
CONSERVATIVE GUY, TRUST ME, I 
WAS ON THE RECEIVING END OF 
SOME OF THOSE VOTES.     
BUT HE DID UNDERSTAND THAT SOME 
PRINCIPLES TRANSCEND POLITICS.  
THAT SOME VALUES  TRANSCEND 
PARTY.     
HE CONSIDERED HIS DUTY TO -- 
UPHOLD THOSE VALUES.      
JOHN CARED ABOUT THE 
INSTITUTIONS OF SELF-
GOVERNMENT, OUR CONSTITUTION,  
OUR BILL OF RIGHTS,  RULE OF 
LAW,  SEPARATION OF POWERS, 
EVEN THE RULES AND PROCEDURES 
OF THE SENATE, HE KNEW THAT IN 
A NATION  AS BIG AND DIVERSE AS 
OURS  THOSE INSTITUTIONS, THOSE 
RULES, THOSE NORMS ARE WHAT 
BIND US TOGETHER.     
IT GIVES SHAPE AND ORDER TO OUR 
COMMON LIFE.      
EVEN WHEN WE DISAGREE, 
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE DISAGREE.    
JOHN BELIEVED IN HONEST 
ARGUMENT AND HEARING OVERVIEWS. 
HE UNDERSTOOD THAT IF WE GET IN 
THE HABIT OF BENDING THE TRUTH 
TO -- OR -- OUR DEMOCRACY WILL 
NOT WORK.       
THAT'S WHY HE WAS WILLING TO 
BUCK HIS OWN PARTY AT TIMES 
OCCASIONALLY WORK ACROSS THE 
ISLE ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM 
AND IMMIGRATION REFORM.  
THAT'S WHY HE CHAMPIONED A FREE 
AND INDEPENDENT PRESS  AS VITAL 
TO OUR DEMOCRATIC DEBATE.      
AND THE FACT THAT IT EARNED HIM 
SOME GOOD COVERAGE DIDN'T HURT 
EITHER.      
JOHN UNDERSTOOD  AS J.F.K. 
UNDERSTOOD, RONALD PRE BEGAN 
UNDERSTOOD THAT PART OF WHAT 
MAKES OUR COUNTRY GREAT IS THAT 
OUR MEMBERSHIP IS BASED NOT ON 
OUR BLOODLINE, NOT ON WHAT WE 
LOOK LIKE, WHAT OUR LAST NAMES 
ARE,  IT'S NOT BASED ON WHERE 
OUR PARENTS OR GRANDPARENTS 
CAME FROM, OR HOW RECENTLY THEY 
ARRIVED,  BUT ON ADD HENCE TO A 
COMMON CREED THAT ALL OF US ARE 
CREATED EQUAL AND DIE BY OUR 
CREATOR.       
IT'S BEEN MENTIONED TODAY  AND 
WE'VE SEEN FOOTAGE THIS WEEK OF 
JOHN PUSHING BACK AGAINST 
SUPPORTERS WHO CHALLENGED MY 
PATRIOT TIM DURING THE 2008 
CAMPAIGN, . 
>>> I'M CERTAIN IN THOSE 
MOMENTS DURING THE CAMPAIGN HE 
SAW HIMSELF AS DEFENDING 
AMERICA'S CHARACTER.     
NOT JUST MINE.      
CONSIDERED IT THE IMPERATIVE OF 
EVERY CITIZEN WHO LOVES THIS 
COUNTRY TO TREAT ALL PEOPLE 
FAIRLY.     
AND FINALLY WHILE JOHN AND I  
DISAGREED ON ALL KINDS OF 
FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES, WE STOOD 
TOGETHER  ON AMERICA'S ROLE  AS 
THE ONE NATION BELIEVING THAT 
WITH GREAT POWER AND GREAT 
BLESSINGS  COMES GREAT 
RESPONSIBILITY.      
THAT BURDEN  IS BORNE MOST 
HEAVILY BY OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN 
UNIFORM.     
SERVICE MEMBERS LIKE DOUG, 
JIMMY AND JACK WHO FOLLOWED 
THEIR FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS AS 
WELL AS THE FAMILIES --   BUT 
JOHN UNDERSTOOD  THAT OUR 
SECURITY AND OUR INFLUENCE WAS 
ONE  NOT JUST BY OUR MILITARY 
MITE, NOT JUST BY OUR WEALTH, 
NOT JUST BY OUR ABILITY TO BEND 
OTHERS TO OUR WILL,     BUT 
FROM OUR CAPACITY TO INSIDE 
EXPIRE OTHERS.      
WITH OUR ADHERENCE TO A SET OF 
UNIVERSAL VALUES LIKE RULE OF 
LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS AND AN 
INSISTENCE ON THE GOD GIVEN DIG 
NIGHT TEE OF EVERY HUMAN BEING. 
OF COURSE JOHN WAS THE FIRST TO 
TELL US THAT HE WAS NOT 
PERFECT.     
LIKE ALL OF US WHO GO INTO 
PUBLIC SERVICE  HE DID HAVE AN 
E GO, LIKE ALL OF US  THERE WAS 
NO DOUBT SOME VOTES HE CAST  
SOME COMPROMISES HE STRUCK, 
SOME DECISIONS HE MADE THAT HE 
WISHED HE COULD HAVE BACK.      
IT'S NO SECRET  IT'S BEEN 
MENTIONED THAT  HE HAD A 
TEMPER.     
AND WHEN IT FLARED UP, IT WAS  
A FORCE OF NATURE, A WONDER TO 
BEHOLD. 
HIS JAW GRINDING,FACE 
REDDENING, HIS EYES BORING A 
HOLE RIGHT THROUGH YOU, NOT 
THAT I EVER EXPERIENCED IT 
FIRST HAND MIND YOU.      
BUT TO KNOW JOHN WAS TO KNOW 
THAT AS QUICK AS HIS PASSIONS 
MIGHT FLARE,  HE WAS JUST AS 
QUICK TO FORGIVE,  AND ASKED 
FOR FORGIVENESS.     
HE KNEW MORE THAN MOST HIS OWN 
FLAWS AND HIS BLIND SPOTS AND 
KNEW HOW TO LAUGH AT HIMSELF.   
AND THE AWARENESS MADE HIM ALL 
THE MORE COMPELLING.       
AND WE DIDN'T ADVERTISE IT, BUT 
EVERY SO OFTEN  OVER THE COURSE 
OF MY PRESIDENCY  JOHN WOULD 
COME OVER TO THE WHITE HOUSE,  
AND WE'D JUST SIT AND TALK IN 
THE OVAL OFFICE, JUST THE 2 OF 
US, AND TALK ABOUT POLICY AND 
TALK ABOUT FAMILY.     
AND WE'D TALK ABOUT THE STATE 
OF OUR POLITICS.      
AND OUR DISAGREEMENTS DIDN'T GO 
AWAY DURING THESE PRIVATE 
CONVERSATIONS.     
THOSE WERE REAL, AND THEY WERE 
OFTEN DEEP.      
BUT WE ENJOYED THE TIME WE 
SHARED  AWAY FROM THE BRIGHT 
LIGHTS.     
AND WE LAUGHED WITH EACH OTHER. 
AND WE LEARNED FROM EACH OTHER. 
AND WE NEVER DOUBTED THE OTHER 
MAN'S SINCERITY OR THE OTHER 
MAN'S PATRIOTISM, THAT WHEN ALL 
WAS SAID AND DONE WE WERE ON 
THE SAME TEAM.      
WE NEVER DOUBTED WE WERE ON THE 
SAME TEAM.      
FOR ALL OF OUR DIFFERENCES WE 
SHARED A FIDELITY TO THE IDEALS 
FOR WHICH GENERATION OF 
AMERICANS HAVE MARCHED AND 
FOUGHT AND SACRIFICED.   
AND GIVEN THEIR LIVES.      
WE CONSIDERED OUR POLITICAL 
BATTLES A PRIVILEGE. 
AN OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE AS 
STEWARDS OF THOSE IDEALS HERE 
AT HOME AND DO OUR BEST TO 
ADVANCE THEM AROUND THE WORLD. 
WE SAWTHIS COUNTRY AS A PLACE 
WHERE ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.     
AND CITIZENSHIP IS AN 
OBLIGATION TO ENSURE IT FOREVER 
REMAINS THAT WAY.       
AND MORE THAN ONCE DURING HIS 
CAREER JOHN DREW COMPARISONS TO 
TEDDY ROOSEVELT. 
I'M SURE IT'S BEEN NOTED THAT 
ROOSEVELT'S MAN IN THE ARENA 
SEEMS TAILORED TO JOHN. 
ROOSEVELT SPEAKS OF THOSE WHO 
STRIVE TO DO GREAT THINGS WHO 
SOMETIMES WIN AND SOMETIMES 
COME UP SHORT, BUT ALWAYS 
RELISH A GOOD FIGHT, A CONTRAST 
TO THOSE COLD TIMID SOULS WHO 
KNOW NEITHER VICTORY NOR 
DEFEAT.     
ISN'T THAT THE SPIRIT WE 
CELEBRATE THIS WEEK?     
THAT'S STRIVING  TO BE BETTER, 
TO DO BETTER, TO BE WORTHY OF 
THE GREAT INHERITANCE THAT OUR 
FOUNDERS BESTOWED? 
SO MUCH OFOUR POLITICS, PUBLIC 
LIFE, PUBLIC DISCOURSE CAN SEEM 
SMALL AND MEAN AND PETTY. 
TRAFFICKINGAND INSULT AND PHONY 
CONTROVERSIES AND MANUFACTURED 
OUTRAGE .  IT'S THE POLITICS
THAT PRE TENDS TO BE BRAVE AND 
TOUGH BUT IN FACT, IS BORNE OF 
FEAR.   
JOHN CALLED ON US TO BE BIGGER 
THAN THAT.   
HE CALLED ON US TO BE BETTER 
THAN THAT.    
TODAY IS ONLY ONE DAY IN ALL 
THE DAYS THERE WILL EVER BE, 
BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN ALL THE 
OTHER DAYS THAT WILL EVER COME 
CAN DEPEND ON WHAT YOU DO 
TODAY.      
WHAT BETTER WAY TO HONOR JOHN 
McCAIN'S LIFE OF SERVICE THAN  
AS BEST WE CAN.     
FOLLOW HIS EXAMPLE.      
TO PROOF THAT THE WILLINGNESS 
TO GET IN THE ARENA AND FIGHT 
FOR THIS COUNTRY IS NOT  
RESERVED FOR THE FEW, IT IS 
OPENED TO ALL OF US.      
AND IN FACT, IT'S DEMANDED OF 
ALL OF US AS CITIZENS OF THIS 
GREAT REPUBLIC. 
THAT'S PERHAPS HOW WE HONOR HIM 
BEST, BY RECOGNIZING THAT THERE 
ARE SOME THINGS BIGGER THAN 
PARTY OR AMBITION OR MONEY OR 
FAME, OUR POWER. 
BUT THERE'SSOME THINGS THAT ARE 
WORTH RISKING EVERYTHING FOR.   
PRINCIPLES THAT ARE ETERNAL, 
TRUTHS THAT ARE ABIDING. 
IT IS BEST JOHN SHOWEDUS WHAT 
THAT MEANS.      
FOR THAT, WE'RE ALL DEEPLY IN 
HIS DEBT.    
MAY GOD BLESS JOHN McCAIN, MAY 
GOD BLESS THIS COUNTRY HE 
SERVED SO WELL.         
.        
.        
. 
>>> LET US PRAY. 
OH GOD OFGRACE AND GLORY WE 
REMEMBER BEFORE YOU THIS DAY 
OUR BROTHER JOHN. 
WE THANK YOU FOR GIVINGHIM TO 
US, HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS TO 
KNOW AND TO LOVE AS A COME UPON 
I DON'T KNOW ON OUR EARTHLY 
PILGRIMAGE. 
GIVE US FAITH TO SEE IN DEATH 
THE FATE OF ETERNAL LIFE SO 
THAT IN QUIET CONFIDENCE WE MAY 
CONTINUE OUR COURSE ON EARTH  
UNTIL BY YOUR CALL WE ARE 
REUNITED WITH THOSE WHO HAVE 
GONE BEFORE THROUGH JESUS 
CHRIST OUR LORD AMANY.      
MOST MERCIFUL GOD WHOSE WISDOM 
IS BEYOND OUR UNDERSTANDING DEAL
GRACIOUSLY WITH FRIENDS AND 
FAMILY IN THEIR GRIEVE, 
SURROUND THEM WITH YOUR LOVE 
THAT THEY MAY NOT BE 
OVERWHELMED BY THEIR LOSS BUT 
HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOUR 
GOODNESS AND STRENGTH TO MEET 
THE DAYS TO COME THROUGH JESUS 
CHRIST OUR LORD AMEN.     
. 
>>> A SOULS ARE IN THE HAND OF 
GOD AND NO TORMENT WILL EVER 
TOUCH THEM. 
IN THE EYES OF THEFOOLISH THEY 
SEEMED TO HAVE DIED AND THEIR 
DEPARTURE WAS THOUGHT TO BE A 
DISASTER AND GOING FROM US TO 
BE THEIR DESTRUCTION BUT THEY 
ARE AT PEACE. 
FOR THO INTHE SIGHT OF OTHERS 
-- HOPE IS FULL --. 
úHAVING BEE 
LITTLE THEY WILL RECEIVE GREAT 
GOOD BECAUSE GOD TESTED THEM 
AND FOUND THEM WORTHY OF 
HIMSELF.     
THOSE WHO TRUST IN HIM  WILL 
UNDERSTAND TRUTH.     
AND THE FAITHFUL WILL ABIDE 
WITH HIM IN LOVE BECAUSE GRACE 
AND MERCY  ARE UPON HIS HOLY 
ONES, THE WORD OF THE LORD.     
.         
. 
>>> A READING. 
SO WE'RE ALWAYSCONFIDENT EVEN 
THOUGH WE KNOW THAT WHILE WE'RE 
AT HOME IN THE BODY WE'RE AWAY 
FROM THE LORD FOR WE WALK BY 
FAITH, NOT BY SIGHT.     
YES, WE DO HAVE CONFIDENCE  AND 
WE WOULD RATHER BE AWAY FROM 
THE BODY AND AT HOME WITH THE 
LORD, THE WORD OF THE LORD.     
        
        
. 
>>> A READING FROM THE GOSPEL 
CHAPTER 15 VERSUS 12 THROUGH 
13. 
JESUS SAID THIS IS MY 
COMMANDMENT THAT YOU LOVE ONE 
ANOTHER AS I HAVE LOVED YOU.    
NO GREATER LOVE THAN THIS  TO 
LAY DOWN ONE'S LIFE FOR ONE'S 
FRIENDS, THE WORD OF THE LORD.  
. 
>> LET US REMEMBER -- WITH THE 
WORDS -- WHAT I DO IS ME.      
FOR THAT I CAME  BUT I SAY MORE 
THE JUST MAN JUSTICES KEEPS 
GRACE  THAT KEEPS ALL HIS 
GOINGS GRACES.   
ACTS IN GOD'S EYE WHAT IN GOD'S 
EYE HE IS  CHRIST FOR CHRIST 
PLAYS  IN 10,000 PLACES LOVELY 
IN LIMBS, LOVELY IN EYES, NOT 
HIS. 
TO THE FATHER THROUGH THE 
FEATURES OF MEN'S FACES.      
DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME,  I AM 
NOT RECOMMENDING  JOHN FOR 
SAINTHOOD. 
HE WAS SO VERY HUMAN  AND FOR 
THAT REASON WE CAN SEE GOD IN 
HIS LIFE.     
HE WAS  THE JUST MAN, JUSTICING 
FOR JOHN McCAIN  EVERY HUMAN 
BEING  DESERVED TO BE TREATED  
JUSTLY. 
HE SAW GOD OUR FATHERTHROUGH 
THE FEATURES OF EVERY PERSON 
ESPECIALLY  THE POOR AND THOSE 
PERSECUTED BY POWER  AND THOSE 
IN NEED. 
JOHNWAS A MAN  WHO LOVED  AND 
HE KNEW  THAT LOVE  IS SEEN IN 
ACTION. 
IN DOING. HE WAS SO OFTEN 
SURROUNDED BY THE SERVICEMEN 
AND WOMEN  HE HAD SUCH A 
SPECIAL AFFECTION FOR.      
WE CAN HEAR HIM  IN 
SHAKESPEARE'S WORDS BUT WE, WE 
SHALL BE REMEMBERED. 
WE, WE FEW  WE HAPPY FEW WE 
BAND ALL BROTHERS.     
LOVE IS TRULY SHOWN IN ACTION  
IN GOD IN HIS LOVE HAS GIVEN US 
THIS WARRIOR AS A SIGN WHO 
ACTED  IN GOD'S EYE WHAT IN 
GOD'S EYE HE WAS.      
THOUGH WE ARE SAD, WE DO 
CELEBRATE  THE LIFE OF OUR 
FRIEND, HUSBAND, FATHER, 
SENATOR, AND WARRIOR BY BECAUSE 
HE DID KEEP GRACE. 
CHRISTPLAYING IN 10,000 PLACES. 
HEGAVE US  AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO 
LIVE, HOW TO BE THE JUST MAN.   
IT WAS ST. PAUL JOHN CAN NOW 
SAY I HAVE FOUGHT THE GOOD 
FIGHT, I HAVE FINISHED THE RACE 
I HAVE KEPT THE FAITH.      
GOOD-BYE JOHN McCAIN.     
       
. 
>>> WE NOW PRAY, OUR HEART -- 
THY KINGDOM COME, THY WILL BE 
DONE ON EARTH AS IT IS IN 
HEAVEN, GIVE US THIS DAY OUR 
DAILY BREAD AND FORGIVE US OUR 
NECESSARY PASSES AS WE FORGIVE 
THOSE WHO TRESPASS AGAINST US 
AND LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION 
BUT DELIVER US FROM EVIL.      
FOREVER AND EVER AMEN.       
. 
>>> FOR OUR BROTHER JOHN LET US 
PRAY TO OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST 
WHO SAID I'M RESURRECTION AND 
LIFE. 
LORD YOU CONSOLED MARTHAAND 
MARY IN THEIR DISTRESS AND DRY 
THE TEARS OF THOSE WHO WEEP.

GRANT TO THEM ETERNAL REST LET 
LIGHT PERPETUAL SHINE UPON THEM 
MAY HIS SOUL AND ALL THE SOULS 
DEPARTED THROUGH THE MERCY OF 
GOD REST IN PEACE AMEN.        
         
. 
>>> TO YOUR SERVANT WITH YOUR 
SAINTS     YOU ONLY ARE A 
MORTAL, THE CREATOR AND MAKER 
OF MANKIND AND WE ARE MORTAL 
FORMED OF THE EARTH AND TO 
EARTH SHALL WE RETURN FOR SO

HOLLOW SPIRIT BE WITH YOU AND 
REMAIN WITH YOU NOW AND ALWAYS 
AMEN.     
. 
>> LET US GO FORTH IN THE NAME 
OF CHRIST THANKS BE TO GOD.     
. 
>>> YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE 
SERVICE THERE, A CELEBRATION OF 
LIFE SENATOR JOHN McCAIN BUT IN 
MANY WAYS THE CELEBRATION OF 
THE IDEA OF AMERICA. 
A GATHERING OFTHE ESTABLISHMENT 
OF THE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT 
IN WASHINGTON THERE WORLD 
LEADERS, BUT ONE  POINT THAT WE 
REALLY CAN'T OVERLOOK IS WHO 
WAS NOT THERE.    
AND THAT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP 
THOUGH HE SEEMED TO BE A THEME 
THROUGHOUT  THIS SERVICE.      
IN FACT, IT WAS  THE SENATOR'S 
DAUGHTER WHO GAVE A REALLY  
POWERFUL EULOGY OF HER FATHER 
TALKING ABOUT MOURNING THE 
PASSING OF AMERICAN GREATNESS, 
THE REAL THING, NOT CHEAP 
RHETORIC FROM MEN WHO WILL 
NEVER COME NEAR THE SACRIFICE 
HE GAVE SO WILLINGLY. 
IT WASSHARP. 
>>  YES, IT WAS.
I CAN NEVER REMEMBER ANYTHING 
QUITE LIKE WHAT WE SAW TODAY, 
THE COMING TOGETHER OF ALL 
THESE PEOPLE.     
AND IT WAS A FITTING TRIBUTE TO 
JOHN McCAIN. 
YOUKNOW WE TALK ABOUT JOHN 
McCAIN BEING THE STRAIGHT 
TALKER AND ALL THAT. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE INWASHINGTON 
TALK THE TALK. 
JOHNMcCAIN WALKED THE WALK. 
JOHNMcCAIN  YES, HE WAS CANDID, 
YES, HE WAS STRAIGHTFORWARD, 
BUT IN THE END AND I THINK WHAT 
THIS SERVICE UNDERLINED IS 
WE'RE GOING TO REMEMBER JOHN 
McCAIN FOR WHAT HE DID, NOT SO 
MUCH  THE WORDS THAT HE USED 
REFUSING EARLY RELEASE FROM 
PRISON DEFENDING BARACK OBAMA 
DURING A HEATED PRESIDENTIAL 
CAMPAIGN, FORGIVING HIS CAP 
TORNADOS IN THE END AND 
RESTORING RELATION WITH 
VIETNAM. 
IN TRUTH JOHN McCAIN LOST MOST 
OF THE BATTLES HE FOUGHT, BUT 
WHAT WE HONOR HIM FOR IS THE 
WAY HE FOUGHT THOSE BATTLES AND 
THE BATTLES THAT HE CHOOSE TO 
FIGHT.   
HE WAS BY EVERY MEASURE  A 
GREAT MAN. 
. 
>>> THEN IT WAS TAKE THOSE AND 
FIND THEM IN YOURSELF, FIND 
THEM IN OUR COUNTRY. 
THEY'REAVAILABLE AS PRESIDENT 
OBAMA SAID FOR ALL AMERICANS. 
SOME OFTHE QUALITIES LISTED FOR 
JOHN McCAIN, LARGENESS OF 
SPIRIT, SELFLESS, DID NOT 
ABIDE, KNEW HIS FLAWS AND 
STRIVED TO BE WORTHY OF THE 
GREAT INTERNS. 
THIS WAS A SERVICE ABOUT JOHN 
McCAIN, BUT ALSO ABOUT THAT 
INHERITANCE THAT EVERYONE IN 
PUBLIC LIFE -- DEDICATE HIMSELF 
TO ARE A PART OF KEEPING THAT 
STANDARD. 
THAT IS THE LARGERMESSAGE FROM 
THIS MOMENT IS THAT WE ALL, ALL 
OF US INHERIT THAT AND HAVE TO 
KEEP THAT INHERITANCE AND WHO 
WILL BE MEASURED BY THE 
STANDARD JOHN McCAIN SET TO BE 
ABLE TO DO THEIR PART. 
>> IT WAS SAID AT ONE POINT THE 
LAST GREAT GIFT JOHN McCAIN 
GAVE AMERICA TALKING ABOUT 
COUNTERING THE PARTISAN SHIP 
AND PERSONAL ATTACKS IN 
POLITICS. 
>> THERE WAS SO MUCH ANTI-TRUMP 
SUB TEXT IN THIS IT ESSENTIALLY 
BECAME THE TEXT. 
BEYOND THEWORDS OF THE EULOGY, 
THE READINGS, THE MUSIC, THE 
PEOPLE CHOSEN TO BE HERE WAS 
ALL THE SENATOR'S DECISION. 
HE WAS THEEXECUTIVE PRODUCER 
AND MANAGING EDITOR OF HIS OWN 
FUNERAL, LUCKY TO BE ABLE TO DO 
THAT.    
THE OTHER THING  KISSINGER IS 
SAID THAT THE COUNTRY'S HONOR 
IS OURS TO SUSTAIN. 
THERE'S A SUCCESSOR TOBE CHOSEN 
A SUPREME COURT NOMINATION 
FIGHT STARTING ON TUESDAY, THE 
LOOMING THREAT OF A SHUT DOWN 
AND THE MID-TERMS ELECTIONS.    
. 
>> A LINE GEORGE W. BUSH 
REPEATED THROUGHOUT WERE BETTER 
THAN THAT. 
>> UM-HUM. 
>>  IT WAS A CALL TO ACTION IN 
MANY WAYS. 
>>  AND JUST TO RETURN TO HIS 
DAUGHTER'S REMARKS FOR A MOMENT 
IT WAS A EULOGY BUT IT WAS AN 
ARGUMENT WHICH IS TO SAY MAKING 
A CASE FOR WHO HER FATHER WAS 
SPEAKING ABOUT THE LOVE AND -- 
IT'S VERY POWERFUL WHEN 
CHILDREN SPEAK ABOUT THEIR 
PARENTS BUT PARTICULARLY 
POWERFUL AS SHE TESTIFIED TO 
HIS LOVE. 
ANDTESTIFIED TO THE POWER OF 
THAT IN SHAPING HER LIFE, UM, 
AND THEN SHE HAD THAT VERY 
STRONG LINE AMERICAN DOES NOT 
BOOST -- OF JOHN McCAIN HAS NO 
NEED TO BE MADE GREAT AGAIN 
BECAUSE AMERICA WAS ALWAYS 
GREAT.     
A VERY POWERFUL EMOTIONAL 
MOMENT FROM A DAUGHTER ABOUT 
HER FATHER BUT ALSO A VERY 
POWERFUL POLITICAL STATEMENT. 
>> AND NO DOUBT AN 
UNCOMFORTABLE ONE FOR THE OTHER 
DAUGHTER IN THE ROOM IVANKA 
TRUMP WHO WAS ASKED NOT TO 
PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S SERVICE. 
>>  I WAS THINKING, WHEN YOU 
GET TO BE MY AGE YOU'VE BEEN TO 
A LOT OF FUNERALS AND SOMETIMES 
YOU COME AWAY FROM A FUNERAL 
FEELING  NOT TO GOOD. 
YOUCOME AWAY FROM THIS FUNERAL 
FEELING BETTER ABOUT THINGS, 
FEELING BETTER ABOUT YOUR 
COUNTRY, WHAT WAS IT THAT 
KISSINGER SAID IT PROVIDE ADD 
MUCH NEEDED MOMENT. 
>> UM-HUM. 
>> AND I THINK -- 
>> YOU SEE THERE THE HEARSE 
GETTING READY TO TRANSPORT 
REMAINS OF SENATOR McCAIN, HIS 
FLAG DRAPED COFFIN THIS HAS 
BEEN A NUMBER OF DAYS OF 
CELEBRATION OF HIS LIFE. 
WE KNOW THAT ITHAS NOT ENDED. 
THERE IS ANOTHERDAY BUT ONE 
THAT WILL BE MORE PRIVATE 
TOMORROW, A MEMORIAL SERVICE 
FOR THE SENATOR AT HIS BELOVED 
U.S. NAVY ACADEMY IN MARYLAND, 
HE ATTENDED HIS FATHER BEFORE 
HIM, HIS SON. 
AND THATIS WHERE HE WILL BE 
BURIED ALONG HIS FRIEND WHO 
DIED IN 2014. 
AND THAT WILL BE A PRIVATE 
SERVICE FOR FAMILY TO SAY 
GOODBYE. 
SO AS THE NATION SAYSGOOD-BYE 
TO JOHN McCAIN,  WE WILL SAY 
GOODBYE TO ALL OF YOU AS WELL 
ALTHOUGH TOMORROW  WE WILL BE 
HERE ON FACE THE NATION WHEN 
OUR GUESTS INCLUDE FORMER 
SENATOR AND SECRETARY OF STATE 
JOHN KERRY AND THE OHIO 
GOVERNOR.       
FROM THE ENTIRE CBS NEWS TEAM 
WORKING ALL BEHIND THE SCENES, 
THANK YOU.
