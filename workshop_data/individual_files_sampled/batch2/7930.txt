all right Republicans don't think that they have a sexual harassment problem that they also think that Democrats do there is a new poll out a survey from HuffPost in YouGov it finds that 76% of Republicans and Republican leaners think Democrats have a very or somewhat serious problem with sexual harassment but just 40 percent of Republicans think that sexual harassment is a very or somewhat serious problem for their own party well a slightly higher percentage forty three percent of Republicans thinks it is not an issue with their own party a majority of Democrats sixty percent think their own party has a sexual harassment problem while seventy five percent of Democrats think sexual harassment is a very or somewhat serious problem with the GOP what does this mean well I mean if this poll was really interesting actually if you look through it because I mean you know you look at those top-line numbers that you read and it obviously seems to indicate that there's a sort of a lot of hypocrisy within the Republican base and not as much during with the Democrat base but if you look into the brass tacks look through the numbers there's some interesting figures it said that in that same poll it said that for example 77% of Democrats still support Bill Clinton despite the fact that 68% of them believe that he probably are definitely sexually committed sexual assault what does that mean what all tribal these days it's like it's all tribalism there's very little principle like no one stands on anything they just kind of like you know we've sort of self sorted within different camps and we kind of just support whatever camp we're in and yeah I think that that I think that that's well true simplistic because I don't think nor do I think he should if Bill Clinton could survive that now so it is a little different to look back well Frank and surviving in right Franken is survived but again in John Conyers let's not pretend that what Bill Clinton was accused of is anyway similar to what Al Franken's been accused or they're obviously they're in different galaxies but so and we don't know if Al Franken's gonna survive it I bet he doesn't I bet he quits but I don't know we'll obviously we'll find out but it is bit more difficult in human nature to go back and assign blame after the fact Bill Clinton gets accused of what he was accused of now I don't think you would survive it although it is worth pointing out that it was that unlike almost unlike every other charge against both people on the right and the left that was funded which did draw into question the legitimately it felt at the time the veracity of some of the accusers but I still don't think that he would that he would survive it now I think he speaks to the DNC and in 2020 I mean yes but I don't think he probably does I think is that I think there if as a former president it probably Trump's that it would be bold to deny him and and you know there's another living president there's two in fact and hopefully Jimmy Carter will still be around in 2020 but you know you know he's gonna bring the house down so that would be interesting that that's that's a different and you can obviously have his uh uh you know and Hillary could could could speak as well so uh I just think it's it's so it's it's that definitely factors into it but as you know a number of Democrats at least publicly have come out written about and spoken that they would really what Bill Clinton was accused of in light of the current climate in light of how we now treat sexual harassment and the ones who came out strongest are running for president yeah so this is this is when you talk about polls it is this is a complicated question to learn something from because I think would Pete there's the psychology of taking a poll where everyone's got their guns up they know and it's like this is my chance to communicate something about myself and about someone's going to learn about the country from this and I'm one of the 300 or you know twelve hundred people that they're asking and it's more simple to ask who are you voting for and we can learn from that what we can do is try to find like controls and things to balance against each other and in this one they ask the same question to Democrats and Republicans and it seems like the Democrats are more self-aware of a problem and more likely to admit that there is something wrong I guess my point is that there in general they admit that's the problem when it comes to like individuals cuz they also the poll also showed that they still support Al Franken even though they you know disagree with what he did and stuff like it's just it's just like when you when when it becomes different when it's like when it's like when are you gonna do something about it whenever there's a poll about like a candidate running against a generic Republican like that the generic person always wins because you can't do that that is one thing that as many all the Bernie supporters and I was a Bernie supporter as well here didn't never quite got like that they didn't they were never campaign run against Bernie Sanders the campaign would have been effective he might have won I don't we'll we'll never know but there would have been a campaign against him instead of the campaign against Hillary and then there would have been very specific things said about Bernie that that kept it that's you know none of that landed because there was no campaign always when you say perfect it's essentially like saying you want this corrupt person or a perfect yes right here acting all right checking all the all the best things about yeah and the difference between those two things it is like saying poll one do you want a thousand pounds of candy yes hold two do you want a stomachache easier to say like yeah the Democrats have a sexual-harassment problem but then when you start to break like okay then okay what about this person what about that person for the nature of the question it's interesting and I don't mean it shouldn't even be asked but then like the the notion that a sexual harassment problem would exist inside of a political party is of no more value than saying do coffee drinkers have a sexual harassment problem sure of course they do men have a sexual harassment problem a few women but overwhelmingly men have a sexual harassment problem and I imagine half of them are Democrats yeah yeah but many of them are independents you know there's some libertarians also if that isn't that is not the that does not mark whether you have a sexual harassment problem or not that only tells you that there may be some uh that you may be able to use the hypocrisy argument uh more aggressively against one party rather than the other but hypocrisy arguments almost never work and also I I you're right I did say something different last time I don't I'm not interested in hypocrisy like I don't really it mean there's very rarely is a argument about personally hypocrisy tends to make people interesting right now it depends on what the irsie is if your hypocrisy is gay people or sinners and they should go to hell or prison and then it turns out you're gay well that's an interesting hypocrisy that I think we should point out if your hypocrisy is yeah I said this then and now I've just largely changed my mind or I didn't realize I'd be in this situation sorry I'm not interested that doesn't matter I care about you know if for politicians what have you done what are you going to do not so much do we catch you in a little moment of hypocrisy I think it's the most important thing when you're looking at politicians is even beyond the individual is just like which power sectors in the society do they owe power - that's right you know and that's it always ends up being what they end up doing an arbitration and then - and an appoint that I you know this is argument I have with Jenko a lot like or at least a thing that I focus on and maybe overly but like in addition to who do they owe allegiance to right who do they owe power to and then who is sitting at their table like who gets to sit at their table because that's almost sometimes a more powerful way or at least a more positive way of putting it like I mean as you make policy as you go forward are there union people there is there's somebody from the Consumer Financial Protection Board there are those people involved in a process of setting policy that matters that matters almost as as you know as Elizabeth Lawrence said and many others have said as well that that personnel is policy who's who's sitting down with Donald Trump when he makes these decisions and the answer for Trump is no one we like no one no one in any circumstance the worst people in a manner the worst people in America are sitting there doing that so so Al Franken do you think he's gonna make it through what do you think waiting should happen I think you should resign I mean especially there's the stakes are so low I mean because they have a Democratic governor they would just replace them with another Democrat is there 900 lose a vote in the Senate like the the the stuff they stand to gain a lot more first of all I you know if they're gonna stand on any sort of principle they should probably just you know and the thing is it's not like it's not like they're throwing the balance of a Senate off or anything like that like the stakes are just way lower it is it is yeah I I largely agree with you what if I like Al Franken's comedy we can get it but are you allowed to like a Woody Allen it will give us the the moral high ground yeah but like you know I already think we have it Oh so right it's frustrating barely that Roy that Al Franken will resign and then Roy Moore will get elected to the Senate there won't be an investigation they won't not seat him they'll seat him and he'll be a United States Senator and then in three years he'll win again this time with the proper Alabama Republican figure of seventy-two percent of the vote right and if Doug Jones wins he'll you know live out the remainder of the Turner of three years it's three years it's four years it's not nothing he'll be there till January of 2021 so it's not nothing but yeah but you know you you know in you know maybe he's able to sort of establish himself as a good old boy who's like - no unlikely I suspect that Doug Joe but my hunch is there the treasurer of Alabama is a Democrat it is just frustrating in a sense that if Alfre and I again I got it he should root he should probably resign but his sins on the people they don't compare his sins don't compare to you know he's at the low end of a spectrum but we're not allowed to have a spectrum because as soon as you have a spectrum it seems like you're sort of dismissing you don't want to be anywhere on the spectrum I think the I think the also the office Al Franken is that there might be more coming that's the thing and he seems to almost suggestion there might be so that's the thing is that is that the the worst thing to do is to have it little by little how you survived it okay survive one she wrote a nice apology letter early ant Whedon forgave him then it was one more and then there to burn out like I mean again you can't slow believe it if there are three more next weekend you're just gonna have
