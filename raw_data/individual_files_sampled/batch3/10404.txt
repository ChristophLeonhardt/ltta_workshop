it's a right old conundrum on the one hand you skip the trial screamed guilty and jump to the punishment part on the other your own guys come out and say hold on there's no evidence analysis by world leading experts at the defense Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down made clear that this was a military-grade Novik nerve agent produced in Russia well that's embarrassing all right Keep Calm first go back on your word and just to be sure delete any old tweets then repost experts who say the opposite of what you said our experts have precisely identified the nerve agent as Nava Chuck it is not and has never been our responsibility to confirm the source of the agent now pretend that nothing happened which is hard to do on the Internet really the Brits ended up having to explain themselves and conveniently scapegoated the poor fellow who transcribed their briefing one of the tweets was truncated and did not accurately report our ambassador's words we have removed this tweet you remember what I said about scapegoating they really did but Boris Johnson himself had said almost the same thing said it's on video you argue that the source of navi choked is Russia how did you manage to find it out so quickly when I look at the evidence I mean the people from from Portland on they were absolutely categorical and I asked the guy myself I said are you sure and he said that there's no doubt wouldn't want to be in their shoes right about now yet they did find a way around it a simple statement saying that Boris Johnson didn't mean it like that what the Foreign Secretary said then and what Portland down have said recently is fully consistent with what we've said throughout having taken things so far so fast they can't afford to do a u-turn this investigation can end in two ways with proof of Russia's guilt all with an uncomfortable silence and hope that everyone forgets until then Boris keep doing what you do every day certainly a Russian connection it's the government going to accuse Russia poisoning of Sergey scruple is not an isolated case but the latest in a pattern of reckless behavior by the Russian state the Russians Russian serve Russia Russia Russia Russian Russian denial I'm afraid the evidence is overwhelming that it is Russia and Boris Johnson has serious questions to answer he claims on German television that this was a Russian produced nerve agent and porton down then examined it and said all they could identify it was personal job they couldn't say where it came from
