I wanted to talk to you a little bit now about your latest project yeah your this is Fort McMurray I love what you're doing because you are trying to fight the stigma about Fort McMurray and it is out there there is stigma I didn't realize it was that bad until I went to BC and talk to these protesters they think you live in a garbage can and they literally live they live in a garbage can but they think Fort McMurray is the ugliest most disgusting toxic place that has ever been and you are doing something on your own you're nobody's giving you money to do it you're just doing it on your own driving around your town with the making these amazing little vignettes about the hidden beauty of Fort McMurray why don't you tell us about it well I wanted to so I was been traveling around the country at pro pipeline protests constantly for the past like six months right and sometimes they're fun and sometimes they're very stressful but like having a cough and a strong my facebook page which does very very well it has some of the biggest reach out of all of them even though my likes are only fifty thousand my reach sometimes it's three four million a month and but it's sometimes it's just so much anger that I have like you know like you're pointing out hypocrisy you're taking on Jane Fonda and I thought you know what what do I do when I went on one war I usually take my dogs I find a creek or I work on my yard or whatever and for McMurray has some of the best air quality in the world it has the best water in the world but no one thinks that so I thought I'll take these little tiny little things and try to try to showcase it but I also wanted it to be unique and different compared to what you know the mainstream media would do and for instance I went to Tower Road now Tower Road is a road where before people used to take garbage out there but they don't do it they don't do that anymore solvent cleaned up and if you drive it for 15 kilometres there's a lake and there's actually a horse ranch there and and I never knew that till two days or till two days before I did the video so I wanted to take those little points and I'm gonna do 365 of them so one of those a day it's about approximately three minutes long and I'm gonna just highlight little different points about the community so I'm very excited and it's got it started to go mini viral and I'm hoping to keep doing it quite a bit so it's just a different way that I could thought I couldn't fight that the misconceptions about Fort McMurray because there's nothing like cap cloud here anywhere so I wanted to showcase that that's an excerpt from my weekly full-length show the gun show on my show I take on the issues of the day through my Alberta conservative lens and I talked to the real news makers the mainstream media ignores to get access to my show in all of our other premium content click the link on the screen to subscribe today you
