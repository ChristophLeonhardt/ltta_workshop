1
00:00:05,925 --> 00:00:08,750
“Well as raids for immigrants
continue to sweep the country,

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,470
a wave of fear and panic

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,180
is gripping undocumented
workers.”

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,770
“New video shows ICE agents
arresting an alleged victim

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,980
of domestic violence

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,070
right after she was 
granted a protective order.”

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,510
“ICE arrests like this

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,740
could become the new normal.”

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,690
“The precedent this
sets for people

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,150
who want to come forward
and help solve crimes

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,950
but are now afraid
of being deported.”

12
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,850
“If I wasn’t undocumented and
if he wasn’t undocumented

13
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,100
I would have called the cops.”

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,080
“They have the right to ask
me if I’m documented or not.”

15
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,150
“What did you see happen?”

16
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,840
“Living under the same roof
when someone that you know

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,780
could harm you or your
children and not being

18
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,220
able to call the authorities —

19
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,220
it’s a very scary situation.”

20
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,590
“You have to think, what
are the consequences

21
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,920
if I call the cops?”

22
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,190
“I don’t want to get
him in trouble.”

23
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,660
“Because it wouldn’t just
be a day in jail

24
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,620
and you learned your lesson.

25
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,359
It would be a day in jail,

26
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:44,005
and then you’re
going to get deported.”

27
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:53,810
“Well I want to thank you all 
for joining me this evening

28
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:59,470
as I sign a law, it ensures
that law enforcement officers

29
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,890
in Texas can and will
cooperate with ICE.

30
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,240
“Elected officials and 
law enforcement agencies,

31
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,880
they don’t get to pick 
and choose which laws

32
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,270
they will obey.

33
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:28,470
Texas has now banned 
sanctuary cities

34
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,060
in the Lone Star State.”

35
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,310
“Senate Bill 4 —

36
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,760
it opens the window for
law enforcement officers

37
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,490
to ask for immigration status.

38
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,830
So that’s the thing.

39
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:55,730
Everybody’s scared.

40
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,940
A lot of folks are scared.

41
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,700
And then that fear
has always been there.

42
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,440
It just enhanced when
S.B. 4 came in,

43
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,880
you know, just in the talks.

44
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,794
And so it doesn’t help
make our job easier.

45
00:03:10,794 --> 00:03:11,820
That’s for sure.”

46
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,520
“It seems like there’s 
a culture problem.

47
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,940
Especially with Hispanics.

48
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,290
There’s so many victims
that eventually do not

49
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,110
go far enough to stop this.

50
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,810
What can we do.”

51
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,460
“We’re not interested in
somebody’s immigration status.

52
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,190
If a person is a
victim of a crime

53
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,560
or the witness of a crime,

54
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,160
we want them to understand
that this department stands

55
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,680
with the victims and
witnesses of crime.

56
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,810
But most importantly,
a crime that impacts

57
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,410
children and women
disproportionately

58
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,550
like domestic violence.”

59
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,300
“There’s been a really
mean-spirited debate

60
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,650
in terms of immigration
at the national level.

61
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,560
And here in Texas with
Senate Bill 4,

62
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,360
with the anti-sanctuary city bill.

63
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,270
It creates an environment
where people feel like,

64
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,360
‘If I report this, they’re
going to be more

65
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,850
interested in my
immigration status

66
00:04:06,850 --> 00:00:00,000
rather than my value
as a human being.’”
