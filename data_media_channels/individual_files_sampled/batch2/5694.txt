join us now New York Times columnist and Pulitzer Prize winning author Tom Friedman his latest bestseller is thank you for being late Tom good morning oh it's good to have you with us you know there are a million places we could go with you we'll start with North Korea we just had the former Director of National Intelligence James clapper on the show and he says actually he's liked what he's seen from President Trump over the last week or so he says he liked the letter he says in some ways Kim jong-un may have met his match here with our very unconventional president clapper of course in 2014 went to North Korea on a secret mission and brought back two Americans who'd been held prisoner there what's your assessment about the way the president has handled this recently and about where this may go if the summit goes off on June 12th well you know I'm hopeful if they can get this together I support the president trying to sit down with the the North Koreans that they're the real questions I have really are twofold um first of all where does China stand on this I believe there'll be a summit between North Korea and president from if China wants there to be a summit let's remember China controls North Korea's gasoline supply I mean you don't drive there if the Chinese don't want you to drive and we know several things about China on this one is that Chinese love Korea so much they want there to be two of them they've always wanted a buffer state between themselves and and the American military presence in the south and they would like to see ultimately the Americans gone and so I think where China is on this is for me one of the biggest questions and I've always believed that the Chinese have been treating the trade talks in North Korean trucks ivana trunks trademarks they're all one story for them and they play one off against the other depending on how they see this going I think the the second huge question in North Korea is is what does kim jeong-hoon really want is he really ready to you know denuclearize that he's used that term but we also know they've sold us that carpet at least twice before and then thirdly if he is ready to denuclearize in what time frame is it one year two years 15 years he has a vast vast industrial nuclear complex and so to me is a look at these talks Willie to sum up I would say President Trump would be very successful if he came out of these North Korean nuclear talks with the deal looking very much like the one President Obama struck with Iran Thomas Richard Haass let's talk about Iran for a second that was the segue I was looking for it's now been several weeks since the administration announced its decision to get out of the the nuclear agreement how do you see things since then playing out and to what extent are you worried about whether it's a saudi-iranian conflict and Israeli Iranian conflict a us-iranian conflict how do you see things playing out here well Richard I think the Iranians number one goal right now as we sit here today is to see if they can strike a deal with the Europeans and therefore isolate the Americans that's really their girl can they drive a wedge between the United States and Europe by being able to go ahead with the nuclear deal on terms that the Europeans will be satisfied with and we're still in the middle of those negotiations so very very hard to tell I've been I believe for a long time that the the real peace process that you need in the Middle East today is not between Arabs and Israelis Israelis and Palestinians although it'd be great if we had that it's between Sunnis and Shiites that basically this conflict between Sunnis and Shiites Persians and Arabs it's tearing the Middle East apart country by country you see the Lebanon you see it in Syria is see it in Iraq and you know until they stop fighting over who's the proper heir to the Prophet Muhammad from 6:23 you know the region's gonna get torn apart and and you really look at what's happened to Syria and what's happened to some of its biggest cities Aleppo Homs Hama and you ask ask yourself Richard and I think I remember you did your PhD on on the Gulf region who's gonna rebuild these cities today and and so if this civil war doesn't stop if they don't find a way to stop this and if we don't help them get beyond this if we just take you know one side or another this whole region is gonna turn into a vast region of disorder Heidi Tom there seems to be bipartisan outrage on Capitol Hill of the president's attempts to help the Chinese telecom maker ZTE we saw the Senate Banking Committee pass an amendment to try and tie his hands in terms of not being able to scale back civil penalties the house also passed out something similar is this an area where you think Congress should step in and what are the limits of that well absolutely I mean that's one of the case I was just in China a couple weeks ago met with Chinese officials et was very very high on their list of things they want to discuss a a huge telecom company that was using our technology basically to sell equipment to Iran and and North Korea and you know it was something there they were quite obsessed with at the same time you know what's what's worried me about Trump from the very beginning is I believe he's a chump when it comes to a lot of these issues I think the Chinese have his number the Chinese do believe it's easy to win a trade war if you're up against a guy who is ready basically to you know trade off things that he doesn't fully understand heidi i think i was listening earlier where you made the point that this guy decided to basically allow ZTE to continue to operate without any expert input without any national security meeting who in the world does that how can you possibly understand the nuances of this story and so you know i I'm quite concerned here's how I see the China situation you know for 30 years China has grown into an economic power by let's be fair to them hard work focus industrialists industriousness postponing gratification by its workers and at the same time by cheating by stealing American technology and by not engaging in reciprocal trade deals that's how they got to where they are today where they dominate the tennis shoes textiles and solar panels if we allow them to use that same strategy on artificial intelligence supercomputing biotechnology clean energy driverless cars the the technologies of the future we are we're going to be in real trouble so this is fight was having but you have to approach it in a really serious way and you can't be somehow you want the backdoor I'll give you this company if you'll give me this thing on soybeans this has got to be approached in a really smart strategic way this is a fight worth having but it has to be done really intelligently John Hillman hey Tom last time we were on television together I asked you for a status update about a column you wrote back in February which I believe may still be the most read thing you've ever written on the New York Times site where you talked about the the piece that ended with the the kicker the biggest threat to the integrity of our democracy today is in the Oval Office speaking of President Trump and in that piece you talked about how he seemed at that point ready to undermine some of our most important institutions the FBI and the Justice Department to keep his compromised status hidden he said then this is Code Red so now we're like almost four months later what code are we at now I'm actually John writing code red two for this Wednesday because I think we're in an even more dangerous situation look these midterms are soon to be upon us and I only have one piece of advice for people you have to vote for a Democrat yeah because and I say that as someone who is you know I have a lot of very conservative leanings on a lot of issues I'm from free trade I'm a pro globalization pro-business but the fact is John the worst Democrat running for Congress or the Senate today is better than the best Republican because the best Republicans except those who are tragically dying or retiring simply will not stand up to this man right and if you see the norms that he is violating the way he is trashing some of our most cherished institutions things like the FBI the Justice Department the spreading of conspiracy theories from the bully pulpit of the White House that is a threat to the very fabric of our society and the very fabric of our democracy so I'm approaching this election coming up unlike any other election I don't care about it's not for me about I don't care I care about these issues but for me it's not about gun control it's not about abortion it's not about high taxes and low taxes it's about whether you can get a lever of power that can restrain this man for the next two years because the man sitting in the Oval Office today is the greatest threat to our democracy and I will just add one other thing which people need to remember we have not had a crisis yet we've not had a real crisis except the crises Donald Trump has created wait till we have a real crisis and you have a president who cannot be believed sitting in the Oval Office then you will really see the true impact of all of this line all of this undermining of institutions couldn't agree more with everything you've just said and how grave it really is I I will add I think it will take a democrat though who understands that it was some Democrats who got us here administration's on both sides of the aisle got us here and got us to Trump because they didn't live up to their ideals but how do we get to a place for our democracy and the fragile beauty of it is respected again Jose let his column for the Washington Post as entitled Democrats may be in for a surprise in 2018 and he writes in part this for much of Trump's reign over Republicans party members got little more from their dance with the Donald than a Supreme Court appointment but as Trump careens toward his first midterm test in November Democrats should understand that they are in for a fight the blundering billionaire has actually begun to fill his political trophy case with victories sure to inspire the conservative base their talking points can also include massive tax cuts a bigger military budget regulatory reform other wedge issue winners include the planned withdrawal from the Paris climate Accords scrapping of the Iran nuclear deal undermining Obamacare add to that the mocking of political correctness and identity politics and you have a platform sure to inspire the activists who drive today's Republican Party unless Democrats find their voice and an alternative to Trump's bleak agenda his pathetic populist shtick may do the trick this fall and that is the fear that we don't really understand exactly how to deal with him because I don't think leaders on both sides of the aisle Tom have been perfect and that's why we're here have been perfect in terms of respecting our constitutional norms and respecting the difference between right and wrong and keeping their promises yeah look yo mica some things are true even if Donald Trump believes them and I think there are several things that are true that Democrats have to wrestle with and where Trump takes them in a negative direction they have to take them at a positive and constructive direction my list would include we do really have a trade issue with China we do we cannot take every immigrant in a world that is splitting between a world of order and disorder where basically everyone now wants to get out of the world of disorder into the world of order we do have issues you know with the Muslim world that have to be resolved constructively political correctness on college campuses is out of control people want a president who will grow the pie not just strength the pie and people want to feel comfortable expressing patriotism and love of country in the age of globalization where national identities are are getting washed out that would be the beginning of my list that the Democrats better take seriously connect with people on these kind of gut issues but where Trump takes them in a negative direction take them in a constructive direction Thomas Friedman thank you very much good to have you show this for always and still I had a among the six tweets from the president so far this morning there's one suggesting that Democrats rather than Russia will be meddling in the upcoming
