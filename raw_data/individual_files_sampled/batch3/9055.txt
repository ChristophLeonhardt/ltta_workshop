THIS WEEK MARKED THE FIRST 500 DAYS OF DONALD TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY OR WHAT I LIKE TO CALL THE FIRST 500 DAYS OF DONALD TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY. I CELEBRATE A LITTLE EACH DAY. I CELEBRATE A LITTLE EACH DAY. THAT IS ME. 500 DAYS. 500 DAYS OF THE MEDIA'S NERVOUS BREAKDOWN BEGAN. A LOT OF STUFF HAPPENED THEN ESPECIALLY FOR YOU IN YOUR LIFE AND THAT IS WHAT MATTERS, NOT US, YOU. THE MATTER WHAT THE MEDIA SAYS LIFE WENT ON WITHOUT THE PREDICTED CATASTROPHES. YOUR LIFE STAY THE SAME OR IT GOT BETTER AND IF IT GOT WORSE, I BLAME OBAMA. NO, I AM KIDDING. STOP, DON'T APPLAUD. TERRIBLE PEOPLE. EVEN IF NOTHING CHANGED THAT IS NOT WHAT WAS PREDICTED. THE TRUMPETS OF DOOM WARNED OF FINANCIAL MELTDOWNS, CIVIL WARS AND NUCLEAR ARMAGEDDON. INSTEAD WE HAVE PEACEFUL PROSPERITY, LOWER TAXES, A REAL CHANCE WITH NORTH KOREA, A BOOMING ECONOMY AND AS AN ADDED BONUS KATHY GRIFFIN WENT STONE BUNKERS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MR. TRUMP. IT'S AN INCREDIBLE AGE. EVEN IF THE MEDIA CAN'T SEE IT OR REFUSES TO SO, IF THIS IS HOW THE MEDIA ACTS NOW IMAGINE HOW THEY WOULD BE ACTING IF THINGS WERE ACTUALLY BAD. REALLY HATES PHONES. IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THIS GOOD NEWS THE MEDIA INSERTS FOR BAD. THEY'RE LIKE THOSE PIGS THAT DIG FOR TRUFFLES EXCEPT THOSE STORIES LIKE WHERE IS MELANIA TRUMP? OH, THERE SHE IS. NEVERMIND ABOUT MELANIA TRUMP. MEANWHILE, YOU SHRUG. THE MEDIA COMPLAINING ABOUT HOW THE NEWS CREATE UNEASE THAT'S A MOSQUITO COMPLAINING ABOUT MALARIA. IT'S WHINING ABOUT RABIES, IRAQ STAR DEPLORING IT'S WHINING ABOUT RABIES, IRAQ STAR DEPLORING CHLAMYDIA. ISN'T IT OBVIOUS HOW FREQUENTLY THEY AVOID THE GOOD? THE MAY HAVE THE NERVE TO RUN STORIES SAYING THAT BAD NEWS MAKES YOU SICK. NO, IT'S NOT BAD NEWS THAT MAKES YOU SICK BUT THAT YOU ARE BAD NEWS THAT HURTS. WITH EACH NEGATIVE STORY MAKES YOU THE VIEWER A VILLAIN AND IS THE CLIMATE WARMING? IT IS YOUR FAULT, YOU SELFISH CONSUMER. RISING INEQUALITY? YOU EVIL CAPITALIST PIGS. FRANKLY, NOT GOOD FOR AMERICA TO HOURLY THAT AMERICA SUCKS. IF ONLY THERE WAS A SOLUTION FOR THIS IN THE SOLUTION THAT SOMEHOW INVOLVES A DOLPHIN. RACIST? YES, YES. ALL THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP. WE LIVE IN A CULTURE THAT HATES WOMEN. DEPRESSING. THE WORLD IS TERRIBLE AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT. IT'S ALL MY FAULT. YES, IT IS ALL YOUR FAULT, TOM. YEAH, YOU, TOM. ALL THIS BAD NEWS IS YOUR FAULT. YOU ARE DESTROYING THE WORLD IN YOUR HEARTLESS BIGOT. IN SHORT, YOU SUCK AND YOU ARE A HORRIBLE HUMAN BEING. I FEEL SICK. GREAT. I HAVE DONE MY JOB. SOUND LIKE SOMEONE NEEDS AND IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT DOLPHIN. IT'S A NORMAL-SIZED DOLPHIN THAT HAS BEEN GENETICALLY ALTERED TO THE SIZE OF THE PERSON AND GIVEN LAKES. WHEN YOU ARE SICK FROM THE BAD NEWS HE WILL BE THERE TO REMIND YOU OF LIFE. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. THANK YOU. WHEN A COWORKER TRIES TO BUM YOU OUT. IF YOU ARE STILL DRIVING TO WORK YOU OBVIOUSLY HATE THE PLANET. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. OR EVEN WHEN YOU LEAST EXPECT IT. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. THAT SOUNDS ANNOYING BUT I GUESS IT BEATS THE SICKNESS AND SADNESS. GET THE IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT DOLPHIN TODAY. WE WILL FLOW IN A IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY SHARK. GREG: THE SELECT MANAGEMENT KNOW THE NO DRUGS WERE TAKEN WHEN WE CAME UP WITH THAT IDEA THE NO DRUGS WERE TAKEN WHEN WE CAME UP WITH THAT IDEA. EVERYTHING IS VIEWED WITH THE SAME FOLDER FROM ACADEMIA WHICH AND CREATES ONE CONCLUSION, YOU ARE THE OPPRESSOR. IF THAT DOES NOT MAKE YOU SICK, IT SHOULD. RIGHT NOW IF YOU GROUND THINGS ARE PRETTY GOOD. WE NOW HAVE MORE JOBS AVAILABLE THAT WE HAVE JOBLESS AND I NEVER HEARD OF THAT BEFORE AND THAT SOUNDS LIKE A NEWS. IS THAT RIGHT MSNBC? BOTTOM LINE THE MEDIA TRYING TO DIAGNOSE CAN ONLY BE DONE WITH THE MIRROR. THEY NEED TO LOOK AT IT AND NOT JUST USE IT TO DO IS OFF. THE MEDIA IS THE PROGRESSIVE HAMMER.
