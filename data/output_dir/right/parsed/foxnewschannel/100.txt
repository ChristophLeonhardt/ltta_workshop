>> Shannon: IF YOU ARE JUST
JOINING US TONIGHT, SAUDI ARABIA
NOW ADMITS KHASHOGGI IS DEAD,
SAYING HE WAS KILLED DURING A
FIST FIGHT AT THE SAUDI
CONSULATE IN ISTANBUL.
GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US
TONIGHT.
WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT OTHER
LAWMAKER'S REACTION.
WHAT IS YOUR REACTION?
>> IT JUST RAISES MORE
QUESTIONS.
FOR INSTANCE, I CAN'T BELIEVE A
15-MAN INTELLIGENCE TEAM THOUGHT
THEY COULDN'T BRING DOWN
KHASHOGGI WITHOUT ANY BODILY
INJURY AT ALL.
THEY'RE EXPERTS.
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
EVEN IF THERE WERE A FIGHT,
WHICH IS HARD TO BELIEVE, THEY
WOULD BE ABLE TO BRING HIM DOWN.
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO KILL HIM OR
CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY.
PEOPLE OF THAT PHYSICAL STATURE
AND TRAINING COULD HAVE BROUGHT
HIM DOWN.
THEN THERE'S A QUESTION OF WHAT
WERE THEIR ORDERS WHEN THEY WENT
THERE.
IT'S ONE THING TO SAY THAT YOU
MISUNDERSTAND AN ORDER, BUT TO
MISUNDERSTAND THE EXTENT OF
TAKING SOMEBODY BACK FOR
INTERROGATION AND KILLING THEM
IS A BIG DIFFERENCE.
AND ALSO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE
BODY?
IS IT TRUE THAT IT WAS CARVED UP
AND TORN APART AND WAS IT BURIED
SOMEWHERE?
THERE'S TOO MANY UNANSWERS
QUESTIONS.
BUT STILL, THERE HAS TO BE A LOT
MORE TO THIS STORY AND HOW CLOSE
DOES IT GET TO THE CROWN PRINCE?
>> Shannon: ABSOLUTELY, KEY
QUESTION.
THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT KHASHOGGI
WAS KILLED BY BRAWLING WITH A
TEAM IS NOT CREDIBLE.
THE KINGDOM AND ALL INVOLVED
MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.
IF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL
NOT TAKE THE LEAD, CONGRESS
MUST.
WHAT CAN YOU DO, WHAT WILL YOU
DO IF YOU DON'T THINK THE WHITE
HOUSE HAS BEEN TOUGH ENOUGH?
>> CONGRESS CAN IMPOSE
SANCTIONS, WE CAN TIE UP MONEY.
BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE
PRESIDENT IS PROBABLY TRYING TO
DO.
IT IS IMPORTANT TO DO ALL WE CAN
TO KEEP THE SAUDIS AS AN ALLEY
-- ALLY, EVEN IF WE DON'T FULLY
TRUST THEM.
WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO PUNISH
THEM.
AGAIN, IT'S A BALANCING ACT THE
PRESIDENT'S IN.
OTHER PRESIDENTS HAVE BEEN THERE
AND THEY'VE HAD TO DO THE SAME
THING.
IT'S A LITTLE TOUGHER FOR
PRESIDENT TRUMP BECAUSE THIS ONE
IS SO MUCH OUT IN THE OPEN.
YOU HAVE AN AMERICAN RESIDENT
AND A JOURNALIST BEING KILLED IN
A SAUDI CONSULATE, WHICH IS
SUPPOSED TO BE SAFE GROUNDS FOR
EVERYONE, AND THEN UNDER SERIOUS
CIRCUMSTANCES.
THIS IS TOUGHER FOR THE
PRESIDENT THAN OTHER PRESIDENTS.
SO, LISTEN, I UNDERSTAND WHAT
THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO DO,
BUT HE HAS TO MAKE IT CLEAR
WE'RE GOING TO STAND BY OUR
VALUES.
YES, IT'S A FIRST STEP, BUT
THERE'S STILL A LONG WAY TO GO.
>> Shannon: ALL THROUGH THE LAST
WEEK OR SO, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
SAYING, LISTEN, THE PRESIDENT IS
BUYING HOOK, LINE, AND SINKER
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.
HERE'S WHAT WAS SAID WHEN I
ASKED ABOUT THIS.
>> THIS IS THE MOST
DISRESPECTFUL THING I'VE EVER
SEEN TOWARD THE PRESIDENT OF
UNITED STATES.
HE HAS DONE EVERYTHING HE COULD
TO HELP SAUDI ARABIA AND THIS IS
THE WAY YOU REPAY.
HE'S A STRONG MAN, PRESIDENT
TRUMP.
THIS WILL NOT GO UNANSWERED.
>> Shannon: DO YOU SEE THIS AS
DISRESPECTFUL TO THE U.S.?
>> IT'S DISRESPECTFUL.
THE FACT IS WHAT THEY'VE DONE
HERE IS IT'S SHOWN THEY'RE STILL
BACK IN THE 19TH CENTURY
SOMEWHERE, THINKING THEY CAN
CARRY OUT THIS TYPE OF MURDER IN
THE CONSULATE WITH THE WHOLE
WORLD KNOWING WHAT IT IS AND
GETTING AWAY WITH IT.
SO, YEAH, IT'S DUMB ON THEIR
PART.
IT SHOWS A CERTAIN SAVAGERY.
BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT
IF WE CAN WITHOUT SACRIFICING
OUR PRINCIPLES, SOMEHOW KEEP THE
SAUDIS DOING THE RIGHT THING AS
FAR AS INTELLIGENCE, IRAN,
RUSSIA, BUT AGAIN, WE CAN'T GIVE
THEM EVERYTHING AND WE HAVE TO
MAKE IT CLEAR THEY HAVE TO BE
PUNISHED FOR WHAT THEY DID.
IT'S A LINE TO WALK.
WE HAVE TO DO IT.
