3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,609
my room is covered in mold right now so

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:07,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've moved everything up to save higher</font>

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,150

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,679
I want to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alexa Chung's it</font>

7
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,960
which was sent to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> by penguin last</font>

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,000

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,039
comes out on thursday<font color="#CCCCCC"> the seventh of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,810
this it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has that format of like picture</font>

11
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,000
picture picture s a picture picture s a

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,500
picture picture essay which i guess is

13
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,910
familiar to a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who follow</font>

14
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,260
fashion blogs and things like that but

15
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">for me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for some reason it just reminded</font>

16
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,170
me of tumblr or not just because of the

17
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,630
range of pictures use it's not specific

18
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,488
to a tumblr style oh that's the platform

19
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:33,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">I use the most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when i'm looking for</font>

20
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,579
style inspiration and also now i'm just

21
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking for pictures i like that i don't</font>

22
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,780
consciously decide a style inspiration

23
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,390
but find their way into<font color="#E5E5E5"> my head like</font>

24
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">that things like as Alexa Chung puts in</font>

25
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,770
here the Spice Girls for me as well

26
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,320
pictures of Ellie Sattler so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is part</font>

27
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,649
memoir sort of style guides or but it's

28
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:54,270
not hugely narrative it is just like

29
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,920
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> through 10 or 20 pages of</font>

30
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone's tumblr the person happens to</font>

31
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,160
be the wonderful miss<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenge so for a</font>

32
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,539
little while I've wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a month</font>

33
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,190
or a week or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't really</font>

34
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,379
know what of beauty and fashion videos

35
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,060
don't really get makeup in any

36
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,100
traditional way later this month I want

37
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">to like set up a camera and show you</font>

38
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,400
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> how I put it on because I feel</font>

39
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,900
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of you would be downright</font>

40
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,820
appalled and most days I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't wear</font>

41
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,950
makeup and whatever slowly perversely I

42
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,780
guess that's what intrigues me about

43
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,850
style guys like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tracing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

44
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,369
most is what people's musts are not

45
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:25,799
saying that it's required for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a human to</font>

46
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,509
go through these paces before they step

47
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:28,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">out the door</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but what in their opinion</font>

48
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,350
are your must steps because more often

49
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,150
than not I completely disagree with them

50
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,970
and that's fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> and healthy and even</font>

51
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,560
more interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are</font>

52
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,240
some stages here where Alexa goes

53
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,430
through her<font color="#E5E5E5"> mas in various cases or</font>

54
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,290
whether that's makeup or clothes or on

55
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,030
the floor<font color="#E5E5E5"> and whether</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it can wear them i</font>

56
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,530
would say that above all with its nice

57
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,659
endpapers my one's signed<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would say</font>

58
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's more at present but but it's kind</font>

59
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,540
of like a coffee table book<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

60
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,860
something you just want to click through

61
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,659
or dip in and out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of every now and then</font>

62
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,399
if this mess behind me were any more

63
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,200
organized<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inclined to keep this</font>

64
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,090
in the memoir section of myself rather

65
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,100
necessarily the beauty of fashion one I

66
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">really like the little s is that she</font>

67
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,350
writes and them you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really get a sense</font>

68
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,210
of her voice her outlook

69
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">where she thinks all that good stuff</font>

70
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,030
you've beat<font color="#E5E5E5"> them was four I think or at</font>

71
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,919
least all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that good stuff I read memoirs</font>

72
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,480
for so yeah the month<font color="#E5E5E5"> of August that</font>

73
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">will still be general book reviews and</font>

74
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,630
they will still be travel videos from

75
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,180
New York and LA but there will also be

76
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,340
some fashion<font color="#CCCCCC"> II stuff and who knows what</font>

77
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,260
that will contain I have ideas that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

78
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,880
generally don't go to plan so anyway I

79
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,440
wish to do a giveaway of two signed

80
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,739
copies of it which I have right yeah I'm

81
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:30,660
to sign copies of it then I've also got

82
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,810
two beautiful limited-edition check bags

83
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,130
which I really really love I've used

84
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,950
mine to carry my shopping and my sneaky

85
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,739
late-night sorbet as well on a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

86
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:42,540
occasions already and on the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> side</font>

87
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,610
there's a quotation pulled from it so in

88
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,110
order to enter this giveaway which by

89
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,640
the way I was not paid to Brian I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

90
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,989
ramble entirely because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought you</font>

91
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:50,640
guys might like some books and subtype

92
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,140
bags it feels weird that I have to

93
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">explain that stuff but I do and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

94
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,890
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only fair but I'm also worried that</font>

95
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,840
like if I ever don't explain that stuff

96
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,459
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's become so normal to be paid</font>

97
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,230
for things people will just assume I

98
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,670
don't know where that bothers me for

99
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,170
discussion later to enter this giveaway

102
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,370
that might be offensive to people mainly

103
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,930
to my mother he would probably ring me

104
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,970
up angry say that I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> used to villages</font>

105
