all right guys we're sending John North Pole to meet Santa and the elves I was a fast we entities that at all just home ramp there that's okay yeah that's where he's going he's leaving in a couple of days so we wanted to tell you guys where he's going so you don't think we fired him oh they'll think that anyway yes so quite the opposite he's doing an amazing docu-series for us for verizon go 90 and Huffington Post so that's who's gonna air it and it is a trip by the Arctic fund and it's for four to six weeks you're gonna be gone for a long time used for four to six weeks assuming weather and ice conditions are good if theoretically we could be there longer okay so whoo that sucks okay so let's talk about what you're doing and then we'll talk about what we're gonna show folks from that trip yeah okay so what it what's the trip yeah so there's this group the Arctic fund which has done a series of expeditions into the Arctic before for a couple different reasons and we're gonna be doing a new one going farther north farther towards the North Pole and they've done before for a couple of different purposes we're going to be on this ship it's primarily sailing expedition in the Arctic for more than a month we're gonna have a group of scientists of various types mainly climate scientists that we're gonna be bringing to two different places going on shore for a night or two nights conducting experiments documenting their work and interviewing them scientists who work in some of the least hospitable places in the face of the earth and we're gonna be working with them there's also gonna be some cartographers and ecologist sand biologists and also the leader of the expedition his reason for wanting to do it is that he is going to be look looking for a Zeppelin that was lost that crashed somewhere around eighty ninety years ago in the area so we're gonna be searching for that underwater as well we've got some like devices that can like go down and do some different stuff okay so and then you have a drone too right yeah so we're gonna be TYT isn't be sending me and we're also gonna have a small crew we're gonna be doing filming we got the you know the full rig and it's gonna look beautiful I think but also drones as well and there's been like we've sort of teased this before and what I have discovered is that while everybody seems to know that something has happened nobody including most people here know where we're going yeah like people have to think it's Antarctica half think it's Alaska so I want to show you so let's bring up this first graphic and you're gonna see it for we've got you know that's a shot down on earth you've got the North Pole there and we've marked out for I guess there is LA in New York and Iceland we're going to be the last land we're gonna be on is that island of Svalbard which is currently wrapped in the permanent ice but some of that will be melted away a little bit and then you see the North Pole there and we're gonna show you another shot right now so they're basically so it is north of Norway basically you know straight towards the North Pole that's sound like pretty far away from oh yeah soon there's way further north than Iceland and when it is way further north it's north of the northernmost part of Greenland that's when you know you're really north that's pretty far John you're our North Star it's very exciting I think that we're gonna have an opportunity to get some some awesome interviews with scientists who are doing cutting-edge work and climate change I'm looking forward to like living with these people for a month or longer and absorbing as much as I can of them and also we're gonna be experiencing conditions that none of us have experienced before I mean I've never really sailed at all let alone straight towards the North Pole so you guys are obviously on a like a fortress of a ship right no actually I was surprised to discover that the ship is a sailboat it's made of wood and it's not particularly big actually so it's a sailboat going to where like it's not exaggerating to say that there's some chance where no human has gone before I mean we're going to an area where generally ships like that do not I mean there's icebreakers and things like that that'll go there there's you know submarines will go over there and stuff like that and I'm sure there's some like big big fishing boats like big metal fishing boats do but I don't think generally like this is as I said farther than the expeditions that the Arctic Fund has gone on before you know certainly with a ship of this size to go where no one has gone before it is quite fitting for you John and you've grown a number two beard yeah well I figured you know I want to look a little bit like Ryker and also insulate myself a little bit yes I mean look people have gone farther on lamb and there are people who have gone on to the permanent land and hiked to the North Pole those people are crazy a lot of time doing it we're not going that far we're only going as far as the ship can go we're going on land before they're but the permanent ice we're going as far as it is broken up and we're hoping to go far but it's to some extent in mother nature's hands so let me clarify two things one the number two beard is a reference to Star Trek and not something else I got what's yours and right what is the number two beard work for okay and then and then the other thing I want to clarify is of course people have been further north than that yeah it's because of climate change more ices melted unfortunately yes which is why this expedition can go farther maybe potentially more than anyone has gotten because the ice just melted exactly ten or fifteen years ago we would not have been able to go as far as we're going to go yeah so thank God for climate change so it's gonna be out rising Oh 90s and having the post and and so we're gonna try to do some like short videos or live videos that we can send back to you guys but obviously the Internet is basically non-existent so yeah well do what we can so and you guys are gonna do different episodes of your adventure there exactly yeah and so they made that trip happen so that that's why it's great that they're partnered up with us to do this exactly and I think there's a very TYT flag on the ship yeah we're gonna have a TYT flag really exciting just it's gonna be it's gonna be a really cool experience is obviously dangerous I mean I think everybody on the trip is a little bit concerned about that but it's a be an awesome experience obviously like climate change is my number one issue and to be able to help amplify the message and research of these workers is like a dream come true so I'm very excited for it okay now last thing just be careful if you see you're on greyjoy get out of there I think flaming arrows me I don't think that's the biggest danger you know they okay that Island that I marked out on the map that we're gonna be that's the last it's the northernmost inhabited like permanent settlement then we're gonna be stopping at for a couple days to do like firearms training that Island firearms training what's not left I'm gonna board your ship outside of that town you are required to have weapons because there are between 500 and like a thousand people who live there generally in a given time and there's at least 3500 polar bears and there's no area where polar bears do not go including in the town that is so cool okay so oh cool all right so this started disastrously for Republicans when you were like I'm going to be stuck on a boat with scientists they're like oh yeah a lot of them are their expertise is climb a tall man so obviously they're sent by the Chinese because it's so low are some of the people there starting the hoax right but then you turn to firearms are mandatory the like wait up now hold on now only in case of an emergency and by the way using them even in self-defense against polar bears is a crime you can go to jail for it really yeah yeah there's big wounds stuff like that you have to save your life like you cannot just go and shoot a polar bear or anything but I want to blow away abandoning ship that sounded fun for a second hey illegal to shoot him Aires what those I'm just messing around with the conservatory good stuff okay and so anyways kidding aside its weird thing is if I'm kind of proud of you thank you yeah I think it's a really amazing trip I can't wait to see the footage from it I can't wait to see the show and and I can't go over four to six weeks but it sounds like an amazing adventure you know it's a long time to be away I'm like I'm sort of curious about what I'm gonna miss and a little bit worried that I'm gonna miss some big news but I'm also glad to not have to pay attention to the craziness but uh yes it's a long time to be away but I think it's gonna be fun it's to me me and chavala who did the ozlowe the Human Rights summit that I went to she was the co-host of that and also a Taylor and Michelle were behind the scenes here at TYT doesn't be way but yeah she wanted Elena was the person who did our original documentaries I don't know how much you guys remember those but the four that we did yeah she's gonna be heading to the North Pole that's directly from Iraq Wow she's a crazy explorer and documentarian yeah so it's a great trip so I hope all of you guys check it out when John comes back and God knows who'll be President when you return all right go get em John TYT membership gets
