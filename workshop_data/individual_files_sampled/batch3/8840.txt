THANK YOU, SIR. 25 MINUTES NOW BEFORE THE HOUR. Sandra: THE TOP STORY OF THE DAY THE CARAVAN OF CENTRAL AMERICAN MIGRANTS MAKING A GRUELING MARATHON MARCH TO REACH THE U.S. SOUTHERN BORDER. PRESIDENT TRUMP ISSUING THIS TWEET. SADLY IT LOOKS LIKE MEXICO'S POLICE AND MILITARY ARE UNABLE TO STOP THE CARAVAN HEADING TO THE SOUTHERN BORDER OF THE UNITED STATES. CRIMINALS AND UNKNOWN MIDDLE EASTERNERS ARE MIXED IN. I HAVE ALERTED BORDER PATROL AND MILITARY THIS IS A NATIONAL EMERGENCY. MUST CHANGE LAWS. TOM HOMAN IS THE FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR OF ICE AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR. YOUR REACTION AS WE CONTINUE TO WATCH THIS CARAVAN NOW IN NUMBERS GREATER THAN 7,000 MARCHING TOWARDS THE U.S. BORDER. IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING DOING THIS JOB FOR 34 YEARS BECAUSE A LOT OF THIS COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED. I'VE SAID FOR OVER A YEAR IF WE DIDN'T FIX THE LOOPHOLES IT WOULD HAPPEN. HERE IT IS. AS FAR AS MEXICAN POLICE NOT BEING ABLE, I WOULD SAY BEING NOT BEING ABLE, SOME UNWILLING. WHEN THEY GET TO OUR BORDER YOU HAVE CHIEF WHO HAVE AMERICAN PATRIOTS. THEY WON'T STEP ASIDE OR STEP BACK. THEM EAU DE FEND THIS LINE. Sandra: HE HAS DECLARED IT A NATIONAL EMERGENCY TO THE BORDER PATROL AND MILITARY. COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT SPECIFICALLY AND THE PRESIDENT SAYING THAT THERE ARE CRIMINALS AND UNKNOWN MIDDLE EASTERNERS MIXED IN THAT CARAVAN. THERE WILL BE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CRIMINALS. THEY WILL PUT THEMSELVES IN THAT GROUP. WE KNOW FOR A FACT BASED ON INTELLIGENCE REPORTS THESE CARTELS SMUGGLING ORGANIZATIONS WILL PUSH A LARGE GROUP OF FAMILY UNITS IN ONE AREA TO TIE THE BORDER TO ASSETS UP. WHILE THE ASSETS ARE TIED UP DEALING WITH FAMILIES THEY PUSH DRUGS AND OTHER BAD PEOPLE THROUGH ANOTHER PART OF THE BORDER. THIS IS WHAT FRUSTRATES YOU. MEMBERS OF CONGRESS KNOW WHAT THE LOOPHOLES ARE AND THEY CAN CLOSE THEM. YOU HAVE THE MEN AND WOMEN DEFENDING THIS NATION AND THEY NEED HELP. YOU WOULD THINK MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, WHETHER YOU'RE REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT, WOULD WANT TO HELP SECURE OUR BORDER. THAT'S THEIR NUMBER ONE RESPONSIBILITY. THANK GOD WE HAVE A PRESIDENT SITTING IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHO UNDERSTANDS THIS AND HAS THE BACKS OF THESE 20,000 MEN AND WOMEN THAT WANTS TO SECURE OUR BORDER. I CANNOT BELIEVE WE'RE EVEN DISCUSSING THIS IS AN ISSUE AT THIS POINT. Sandra: SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO IS ACCUSING THE CARAVAN OF INCITING VIOLENCE FOR POLITICAL REASONS AND ISSUED A STATEMENT, A VERY FORMAL ONE SAYING THIS. MANY MIGRANTS ARE ATTEMPTING TO TRANSIT THESE COUNTRIES AND IN THE PROCESS VIOLATING THEIR SOVEREIGNTY, THEIR LAWS AND PROCEDURES. AS PRESIDENT TRUMP STATED THE U.S. WILL NOT ALLOW ILL LEM IMMIGRANTS TO ENTER OR STAY IN THE U.S. THEY ARE CONCERNED THEY MAY BE VICTIMIZED BY HUMAN SMUGGLERS AND OTHERS WHO WOULD EXPLOIT THEM AND CONCERNED ABOUT THE VIOLENCE PROVOKED BY SOME MEMBERS OF THE GROUP AND POLITICAL MOTIVATION OF SOME ORGANIZERS OF THE CARAVAN. IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT. I'M GLAD YOU ASKED IT. THIS IS SOMETHING NOBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT ESPECIALLY DEMOCRATS, RIGHT? THEY WANT TO TELL THESE PEOPLE TO COME THIS THIS COUNTRY. THEY WANT TO OFFER SANCTUARY CITIES AND SUPPORT SANCTUARY CITIES WHERE THEY THINK THEY CAN GO TO A PLACE AND BE PROTECTED FROM ICE. THEY DON'T WANT TO FUND ICE FOR THE NUMBER OF BEDS THEY NEED. THEY WANT TO ABOLISH ICE. THIS ENTICES MORE PEOPLE TO MAKE THIS DANGEROUS JOURNEY. THEY DON'T COME BY THEMSELVES. THEY HIRE CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS TO GET TO THE COUNTRY. IN MY 34 YEARS I'VE SEEN NUMEROUS WOMEN RAPED. CHILDREN DIE MAKING THAT TRIP. I WAS IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA WHEN FAMILIES WERE HELD HOSTAGE AND SMUGGLING FEELS DOUBLED AND TORTURED AND KILLED. I WAS IN THE BACK OF A TRACTOR TRAILER FOR PEOPLE WHO SUFFOCATED TO DEATH. WHEN YOU HAVE WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. THESE PEOPLE ARE AT THE MERCY OF CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS WHO DON'T CARE ABOUT THEM AT ALL. THEY'RE A COMMODITY AND THEY'RE THERE TO MAKE MONEY. THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STORY, NOT JUST ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT IT'S SAVING LIVES. NOBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT IT, ESPECIALLY DEMOCRATS. WHEN THEY ABOLISH ICE AND TO THROW OUT SANCTUARY CITIES AND KEEP THEM IN THE UNITED STATES. THEY WANT TO KEEP THEM IN THE UNITED STATES ILLEGALLY BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO BUILD A WALL TO KEEP THEM OUT. MORE PEOPLE WILL BE VICTIMIZED BECAUSE OF IT. Sandra: SOME OF THOSE INVOLVED IN THE CARAVAN IS SAY WHAT THEY'RE FLEEING. THEY CAN'T FIND WORK. FLEEING VIOLENCE IN SOME CASES. THE PRESIDENT TWEETED THIS OUT IN ONE OF HIS MOST RECENT TWEETS. EVERY TIME YOU SEE A CARAVAN OR PEOPLE ILLEGALLY COMING OR ATTEMPTING TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY ILLEGALLY BLAME THE DEMOCRATS FOR NOT CHANGING THE PATHETIC IMMIGRATION LAWS. REMEMBER THE MID-TERMS. SO UNFAIR TO THOSE WHO COME IN LEGALLY. SO TOM, TWO WEEKS OUT FROM MID-TERMS, HOW DOES THIS ALL PLAY OUT? I HOPE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE PAYING ATTENTION BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS 100% RIGHT ON THIS POINT. I'VE BEEN ON THE HILL MANY TIMES. AGAIN, UNTIL THE DEMOCRATS COME TO THE TABLE THERE ARE SOME DEMOCRATS LIKE SOME FROM TEXAS BUT THE VAST MAJORITY DON'T WANT TO GIVE THIS PRESIDENT A WIN ON IMMIGRATION OR A WIN ON THE BORDER ISSUE. THIS IS ALL ABOUT PUTTING POLITICAL HATRED OF THIS PRESIDENT AHEAD OF NATIONAL SECURITY AND PUBLIC SAFETY. AHEAD OF THE SAFETY OF THESE AMERICAN PATRIOTS ON THE LINE THAT WEAR THE UNIFORM IT IS DISGUSTING. Sandra: GOOD TO HAVE YOU ON THE PROGRAM. FORMER DIRECTOR OF ICE SOMETHING YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT. YOU'VE CALLED THE PRESIDENT A
