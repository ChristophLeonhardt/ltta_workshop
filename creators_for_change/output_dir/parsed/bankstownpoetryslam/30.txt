poetry is the picture worth a thousand
words it's all the songs you've ever
heard it's the flight of a flock of
birds so don't mock it's the beat of all
their wings it's a bill that rings the
voice that sings the crowns of Kings
it's all these things more so come down
to the bank sound art center of this
