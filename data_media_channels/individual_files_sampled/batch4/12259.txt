media outlets are a GOG and some are even to gods over the latest allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh a woman who may or may not exist has given the New Yorker magazine details of an incident that may or may not have taken place but which has been confirmed by several witnesses who say they weren't there writer Ronan Farrow says the possibly imaginary woman did not remember the time or location of the incident but that this is a normal reaction to sexual trauma especially when suffered by people who may not be real hearing of the new charges Democrat Senator Dick Durbin said quote I believe her but then I'm a complete sleazeball so I never trust anything I say unquote meanwhile super trustworthy porn star lawyer Michael avenatti says he has a client who has extremely credible evidence that she has made up a story about Kavanagh which if true would end his career avenatti said he could not give full details until there were at least a dozen cameras pointed in his direction but he hinted the story involved six underage girls a rubber chicken a gang of pirates three circus clowns and a graphic description of a sexual organ that may or may not belong to a woman who was absolutely sure Kavanaugh would have brutally raped her if they had ever met in the wake of a vanadis charge Senator Dianne Feinstein's said the Cavanaugh hearing must be suspended immediately until more news networks could broadcast the baseless allegations so that people who didn't listen to the news very carefully would understand the sort of monster it sounds as if they're dealing with a new poll shows that voters now oppose the confirmation of whoever we're talking about to whatever he's nominated to until whatever's at issue has been thoroughly investigated now leave us alone Republican Senator Chuck Grassley meanwhile says if the latest witness does not get in touch by the Thursday deadline he will move the deadline to Friday and this time he's serious trigger warning I'm

coming so yesterday I had this dream that the Republicans started fighting back and stood up for themselves I was like no this can't be this can't be real it can't be I woke up you know I was like I might do my eyes deceive me or those Republicans with spines I've never seen such a thing before I've got to lay off the mushrooms I think it's just like thinking it's how many drugs I suddenly thought Roe but did you ever wonder why it is so hard for why do Republicans not fight back I mean they they they're right about everything I mean at least as far as so far as they represent conservatism they're right and they just it always seems like they just fade away they you know they kind of get up right up there and then it's like maybe not maybe we won't do it and all that talk remember when Trump was running out when Trump started running I was appalled I did not like Donald Trump at all and people kept saying to me yes but he fights and I would say yeah but he lies and he bullies people yes but he fights and I thought how important is that well it turns they had a point it is important it is important and the fact is he fights because he understands the media because he is a media guy this is why the media hates him so very much is because he's them on the other side he understands what they do and who they are and that they have to be taken down and they have to be answered every single time and they have to be made fun of and they have to be ridiculed they have to be exposed he gets that he gets the media and for all this time you know part of part of the rap on Republicans it's not always fair guys like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell are always being accused of cowardice and being soft and all this but you know their institutional men their guys in these great big cat wrangling institutions and they can't always do what some guy on the radio who's pounding is fists into his palm wants them to do it so I don't you do something well because they're managing hundreds of people with the huge egos and sometimes you just have to be sly and slow and fight it out but it's also the media I mean the media has which is wholly owned and operated subsidiary of the left the media has this great gig going on it is they define the terms by which you can be identified as a racist or sexist and then they say oh you know the thing about racism the first thing about racism is you don't know you're racist you don't know like I'm not really that's a sign that's a sign you're racist when you say you're not racist that means you're raises because if you knew you were racist then you wouldn't be racist you're like I know what it's like it's like talking to Freudians back in the day remember the Freudian psychiatrist ah you want to sleep with your mother sleep with my mother have you seen my mother I don't even like my mother Pasi you wouldn't say that if you didn't want to sleep with your mother so they know your race so you don't know you're racist but they know they know you're racist because they can hear the dog whistle so you say you know I think a country needs a border every country on Earth is I've always had a border we should secure our borders because people are coming across in the South the south those people are brown you're racist I'm not racist uh gotcha see if you were racist you if you weren't racist you wouldn't have said you're not racist because that means you're racist so they get you it so this is what Republicans are dealing with and of course if Democrats say oh yes Barack Obama he's a clean Negro who should be serving us coffee but just happened to remember all that stuff Joe Biden and Bill Clinton were saying about Barack Obama incredibly racist you know a superior arrogant stuff that was fine no dog whistles there because it's all about really all really about politics but if you say wow the Obama these are dark days a dark see that dark you got to dark I heard the dark you said dark you're erase I'm not raised to see that proves it so Republicans have been dealing with that for 30-40 years and they're like abused children they're afraid to speak and they back down because they're constantly being told oh you have to do this or you're racist you have to do this or you're sexist this time this time they finally figured out they have to stand up led by lit by a little bit by Trump who came out and backed Brett Kavanaugh yesterday but really by Cavanaugh who finally finally started to talk back he went on Martha Macallan's Callum's Fox show the story and he just said he is not going to stand down so play cut number two I'm not gonna let false accusations drive us out of this process and we're looking for a fair process where I could be heard and defend the my integrity my lifelong record my lifelong record of promoting dignity and equality for women starting with the women who knew me when I was 14 years old I'm not going anywhere see this is a big deal because they were depending on him to run for it they were depending on him for run for it they keep thinking if they can just break the if they can break the spines of the spineless Republicans and he folds then they've won you know the New York Times had an headline I just kind of gave the game away today the Democratic dream defeat Cavanaugh win the Senate and stop Trump Supreme Court picks in other words let's not let this election have consequences it's okay for elections have consequences when we win them but not when the other side wins them and here they they they had they quote a guy Brian Fallon a campaign advisor to Hillary Clinton he says saving the Supreme Court from Trump's clutches has always involved a very complicated two-step first block Cavanaugh then fight like hell to win back the Senate and remember they're using the Anita Hill playbook but the whole thing is you have to remember this they lost with Anita Hill because Clarence Thomas stood up to him and said this is a lynching so maybe you know we were talking yesterday about how they rewrite all the history in their television shows and their movies and those movies and televisions redefine history but history real history remains the same it doesn't get rewritten by HBO it doesn't get rewritten in the movies history remains the same and they lost they could not stop Clarence Thomas and now they're thinking hey that's an idea what if we stand up so even Mitch McConnell took to the Senate floor yesterday and made what for him was a powerful speech defending their their nominee Democrats have signaled for months they'd put on whatever performance the far-left special interests demanded and throw all the mud all the mud they could manufacture it's not like they didn't warn us but even by the far-left standards this shameful shameful smear campaign has hit a new low I'll get into the specifics in just a moment but I want to be perfectly clear about what has taken place Senate Democrats and their allies are trying to destroy a man's personal and professional life on the basis of decades-old allegations that are unsubstantiated and uncorroborated that mr. president is where we are this is what the so-called resistance has become I mean for Mitch that's a tantrum like that's for Mitch McConnell that is the moral equivalent of throwing a table across the room that was a very forceful he's not exactly the most traumatic speaker but that was a very forceful speech and it signal it put up a signal no we're standing he says we are going to vote on this this is coming to a vote it is going to get past the committee so going back to this interview with martha maccallum Cavanaugh says he was never even at Fort sport I mean this is the the thing the the things the stuff they're throwing at him now are so unsubstantiated that it's just not fair it's not fair to knock him down on the basis of this he says he was never at this party he never was in the town he wasn't in the town when they were doing it but the big one was that Michael avenatti thing where Michael avenatti said oh we have evidence that he nyan mark judge were kind of going to these parties and organizing gang rapes and so martha maccallum asked him about that and this was a very dramatic conversation totally false and outrageous never done any such thing known about any such thing when I was in high school and I went to an all-boys Catholic High School a Jesuit High School where I was focused on academics and athletics going to church every Sunday at little flower working on my service projects and friendship friendship with my fellow classmates in friendship girls from the local all-girls Catholic schools and yes there were parties and the drinking age was eighteen and yes the seniors were legal and had beer there and yes people might have had too many beers on occasion and people generally in high school I think all of us have probably done things we look back on in high school and regret or cringe a bit but I know that's not what we're talking about we're talking about an allegation of sexual assault I'd never sexually assaulted anyone I did not have sexual intercourse or anything close to sexual intercourse in high school or for many years thereafter and the girls from the schools I went to and I were saying that all through all these years that are in question you were a virgin that's correct never had sexual intercourse with anyone in high school Cotton's through what years in college since we're probing into your personal years many years after I'll leave it at that many years after oh my god a virgin what does he Mike Pence remember you're my fence because he said he said I wouldn't go out he wouldn't go out with a woman alone what are you afraid of Mike you're afraid the 35 years later she's gonna charge accuse you of something you didn't do I mean it is amazing you can't win you can't win if you're Mike Pence you're a horrible crazy Christian who doesn't like women and if you go out with a girl who knows they may crucify you later on now we've got to talk about Dollar Shave Club because I want to answer the question how do I look so great and I know yeah as you know I have been a member of Dollar Shave Club since long before they became a sponsor I heard about them on Sean Hannity show and I actually was testing Sean I thought he sounds really sincere I want to see if he's done because then I won't believe him about anything if they're no good but they're great they're absolutely great they have everything you need to look feel and smell your best and as you know I got a lot of real estate to cover so I really need to use the best blades and I like all the other products they have now I've now tried them all out at first I didn't use any of them but

Clavin it's que la vie aan so now it turns out the guy's a virgin and listen that was an answer to Michael Alba naty's Jorge creepy as as Tucker Carlson calls him creepy porn lawyer listen to a vanadis response it is unbelievable so what exactly is he saying is he saying that he did not have sexual intercourse and are we going to get into a death of the word to you exactly well exactly I mean are we gonna get into a definition of sexual intercourse I mean does that mean that he performed oral sex or had oral sex performed on him does that mean any host of any other sexual activities occurred or does he want America to believe that the only thing that he did until well into his college years was effectively kiss or French kiss a woman is that what he wants America to believe well because I don't believe it but what if the times dude is that clear him well I I don't believe it and I think it shows that he's lying he's lying because he doesn't believe it a when I when I think of the things I've done he can't possibly have done that you're not too sleazy Mike right and the funny thing is now by the way he's locked his Twitter account why because I don't think he's got I thought he thought they were gonna fold I thought they I think they all thought he was gonna fold and they all thought the Republicans were gonna fold listen to if Cheryl gay Stolberg in the New York Times who suddenly realized wait conservatives are fighting back and she can't believe it listen to what she says they're kind of circling the wagons around judge Kavanagh you saw President Trump come out today and say he stands by him he's with him all the way we're told senator Mitch Connell is going to make a full-throated endorsement of judge Cavanaugh when he takes the Senate floor this afternoon we're already seeing statements from people like Orrin Hatch and Tom cotton both Republican senators saying let's go ahead with the hearing and go ahead with the vote and they're attacking Democrats as running a smear campaign and I think you know this is actually galvanizing conservatives believe it or not in them conservatives are telling me that they are more than ever behind judge Kavanagh that they feel that he's being unfairly attacked and as you know we're in the middle of a midterm election season so this is apparently riling up the conservative base just as the stories from these women are energizing Democrats especially Democratic women believe it or not she says she cannot believe it when we lie about you you're so folks supposed to fold when we start hurling these you know baseless accusations on you you are supposed to back down let's see what happens if they stand their ground I think it is going to be a good thing so the other thing that was happening yesterday that really cracked me up especially because of the way the New York Times covered it the New York Times is like his source was like constant satire at this point Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein he's been part of this whole DC circus circus right there's the story that was going around that after James Comey was fired and this was in the the guy who was Andrew McCabe who was the acting head of the FBI after Comey was fired he wrote memo saying that rod Rosen seemed suggested he would wear a wire talk to trump tape trump and then they could get rid of him via article 25 which says if you can get rid of the president if he's not fit to serve office Rosenstein says this isn't true he says some said it was a joke britt hume tweeted today the the fox the dean of fox commentators but you tweeted according to our sources at foxnews it wasn't a joke it was a sarcastic rebuttal to an accusation that he wasn't being tough enough on trump as in what do you want me to do wear a wire somehow this got construed as a claim that he was joking or that he didn't say it I have a very unpopular opinion about this because I know we want to talk about the deep state we want there to be conspiracies against Trump in the deep state I believe what Brittany Holmes said I believe Rosen Singh why because Rosenstein is a very very smart guy you don't have to like him but he's a very very smart talented attorney he knows there ain't gonna be no article 25 he knows he's not gonna wear a wire and they're against the president that is just garbage I just don't believe it nikki Haley and Mike Pompeo we're at the UN they both said that it was all so ridiculous here's Haley literally I have never once been in the White House where that conversation has happened I am not aware of any cabinet members that are even talking about that it is completely and totally absurd no one is questioning the president at all if anything we're trying to keep up the pace with him in the fact that he's got a lot he wants to accomplish very quickly and we're gonna continue to support him in the way that he does that so they're just trying to keep up with Trump they're not can't rid of him so yesterday rod Rosen seen anyway goes over to the White House and the reporter saying he's gonna resign he's gonna be fired he's gonna be fired then he's gonna resign he's gonna resign then he's gonna be fired first or resign and then he'll be fired no your quit if I got all of it none of it happened he went over there Trump's New York at the UN so there wasn't gonna be any fire in him he wasn't gonna resign if he wasn't getting fired and Trump said we'll talk on Thursday and we'll find out what's going on I mean he should answer for this you know he should this is a serious thing you don't want your Deputy Attorney General saying this so he should answer and talk about what's going on and and what he meant and all that and Trump should find out the truth and of course he you can always depend on Adam Schiff to be the sleaziest guy in the room if he he and Michael not have an audio to start their own law firm he's like the Joe McCarthy he says all if he fires rod Rosenstein it'll be the Saturday night massacre all of Watergate Rosen Stein's should under no circumstances resign if the president tends to obstruct justice Rosen Stein should require him to be fired he shouldn't take a step affirmative Lee and essentially let the president off the hook this looks to me like a slow-moving Saturday night massacre it seems like the only question is whether a v-steps take place now or they take place after the midterms when the president believes he'll pay less of a political price for it but the fact that these steps the firing of Komi pushing out wrought Rosenstein whether it's done now or later the firing of the Attorney General is apparently seems contemplated after the election these are in their cumulative form the same as the Saturday night massacre and all designed for the same end and that is to give the president direct control over investigation which he may be implicated so he really is like the reincarnation of Joe McCarthy obviously the Saturday night Massacre when Archibald Cox the investigator into Watergate Nixon fired him and he had to fire a lot of people before he could find somebody who would fire him the Democrats always wanted to go back to Watergate they harken back to Watergate that was their great triumph when they overturned an election of someone they didn't like without having to go back to the people and that's what they're trying to imitate with Donald Trump so they're always thinking about that but what I love is the New York Times a former newspaper the way they report this they say even for an administration famous for chaos and rival factions Monday's events of regarding Ron Roden Rosenstein offered a remarkable display of the anxiety gripping the Trump administration where was the chaos the chaos was at the New York Times the chaos was in the media the anxiety was in the media all of this is in the media and I'm not saying the Trump the White House isn't chaotic I don't know I'm not there but they're not worried about it it's only it is only the New York Times and certainly not bothering me it's not my life the chaos is in the press so we got to bring on Ann Coulter because she's got her new book the resistance is futile how the Trump heeding left lost its collective mind it is out now and has been on the bestseller list the New York Times bestseller list so many times I have lost count you know because when she first came out she was such a rock star and so beautiful and she would did the dresses and the short dresses and all that stuff people didn't notice what a terrific writer and researcher she is and I was living in England when she first became famous and I was going like wow you know this woman is really something because he she's not doesn't just look like that which is spectacular she's still spectacular but she also has got the substance that she really is a good observer of the political scene plus she has got a mouth on her like nothing else and then but the other thing I always I'm always afraid I'm gonna ruin her career by pointing out that in person she is one of the sweetest people I have ever met I'm absolutely crazy about her so here's Ann Coulter talking about her new book resistance is futile and it's so nice to hear your voice how you doing great to talk to you Andrew Klavan so your new book resistance is futile how the Trump hating left lost its collective mind I have to ask you now you were one of the first early Trump subscribers I remember you getting mocked on the Bill Maher show for saying he was going to win where do you stand on Trump now how is he doing well you'll notice the cleverness of my book is I don't have to say much about Trump himself it's about the opposition to him because I started noticing I mean for those of you who follow me assiduously on Twitter know that I'm a little upset with the man for not keeping his promises I mean this really was like a miracle candidacy no he was never what I had in mind as presidential material but he was the only one who was saying all the things that none of the rest of them would say on trade on immigration on defending our borders and not other boards he hasn't really done any of that and then you have this lunatic opposition to him and they don't notice the huge huge errors he is making that could drive his base away from him no no no they have to create some crazy Russian conspiracy it's this demented loser who's lying about his taxes and is going around assaulting women also managed to engage in a vast international conspiracy with our geopolitical enemy Russia to steal the election from the most qualified woman ever to run for that office so the book luckily for me I really have to say anything nice about Trump and in fact I mean the one the one hopeful note I ended on which but the very last sentence I'll give you a little secret I only threw in the very last sentence of the entire book because I thought kind of harsh on Trump and some people are getting are getting annoyed with me for for ragging him on on Twitter including him himself but screw him build the wall if you want me to stop but the final chapter is you know maybe the only thing we'll ever get out of this guy is he'll destroy the media which would by which I mean the existing mainstream media we can build a new bit media on more ethical lines because that is what the whole sold the first 200 pages of the book attacks the media is just completely out of control with Trump they have lost their minds and they're not they're not hurting Trump they're helping him they're not and they're certainly not helping the conger well now let me ask you that I mean the book is called resistance is futile is it futile I mean it the polls are kind of showing that people want the Democrats to take back Congress do you disbelieve that I think Republicans are working so hard to ensure there is a blue wave they may overcome the good effort of the insane media I mean their base is white-hot the odds are historically there ought to be a blue wave Democrats should have a really big year and is our base excited well there's no wall and and just a couple of days ago the Washington Post ran big article talking to various Republican senators who don't even have the decency to lie to the voters you're up for election and you come out what a few weeks before the most important midterm election in a very long time and yeah we're never giving you a wall John Cornyn Joe I'm going I mean I was advising them Andrew whoever their advisors are yep yep we checked with the American people they have no interest in a wall it's really going to help you yeah I just I don't even know if they're corrupt or stupid at least cynically lied to us and and pretend we're getting a wall after the midterm election and now with this Cavanaugh business well since it was such a big issue what's stopping them I'm seriously I don't know I I figured the one thing we were gonna get out well I say one thing destroy the media maybe the only thing now but but on um one of the things I loved about the Trump campaign was he really exposed my party the Republican Party I knew the Democrats didn't particularly care for Americans but I mean the hatred for shrimp instead of other Republican candidates grabbing on to his issues that that night on Bill Maher where I said Trump was the most likely to win the nomination he was just asking about the nomination then that was two days after what I fondly call the Mexican rapists speech Trump wasn't even my candidate then the rest of the tape that I follow up by saying he's not my candidate I'm still hoping for a Romney Scott Walker ticket because they're like you know serious individual whereas they they have the background in politics the sort of thing you would you want term presidential candidate why didn't candidates like them grab Trump's issues wow this is popular Americans are willing to put up with a complete lunatic if he will just build a wall deport illegals and the job-killing trade deals for once do something for the flyover people do something for the working-class I'm not working class this isn't self-interested but no no no Republicans check with her their consultants and the consultants check with the donors and know what the American people want is more cheap labor what all right so let's let it let us talk about the Brett Kavanaugh this is I'm finding this kind of disgusting it reminds me of Vince Foster's suicide note remember where he said that destroying people in Washington is a sport so what first of all what do you think where do you think this is going I want them to vote today this is so outrageous I knew they were gonna do this I I'm just I'm I'm I'm furious about this I knew this would come up you had probably every I was in college in law school about the same time as Brett Kavanaugh I know this didn't happen absolutely didn't happen one girl who says I was her but Ramirez is the woman's best friend in law school if this had happened I would have known about it and no this didn't happen and that woman gives her name as did five other close friends of of both of them in that dorm room they give their names and say absolutely this never happens so it's a good job but we'll the Republicans cave I'm terrified they will do a piece like this would never have been run against anyone else yes that's I mean that's not Ronan Pharos fault it's the New Yorkers fault you can't imagine a piece like this you don't have one person substantiating which actually kind of surprises me because I think probably 99% of the female graduates from Yale or Yale Law School attended pussy hat marches that you can't get five of them together to do lie about Kavanagh to save abortion but I mean one thing in torez mentoring I checked to make sure I was my recollection was right about this I looked it up on Nexus Cavanagh was one of 10 stars lead prosecutors right those of us who lived through it Bill Clinton James Carville Larry Flynt Harvey Weinstein had a book that did nothing but slant look into the personal lives of stars prosecutors and people like me I got the book killed it was called insane clown posse there was massive investigation that was Bill Clinton's approach attack the people who are investigating me and they couldn't find a Cavanaugh's name was all over the news back then that's what I checked on Nexus to make sure it wasn't just something I happen to know from like Washington gossip oh no no it was all over the news Brett Kavanaugh Brett Calvin of rock Havana and the Clinton attack machine couldn't find this woman Ramirez when he was one of the lead prosecutors on an investigation that led to the impeachment of Bill Clinton for whipping out his penis in front of female underlings what what do you think what do you think of the this entire kind of me to thing where something you did 35 years ago comes back and bites you do you have sympathy for the me too or is it all just a kind of political scam well it's a mixed bag some of them I think are great some of them are I mean you know you notice it's III I'm not sure I'd call this me - this is this is working we're saying yeah sure but most of the ones that have been described as me - it was all 100% liberal sexual predators who had been protected for 20 years why because Hillary Clinton was running for president and they needed to defend Bill Clinton and Teddy Kennedy and suddenly suddenly they're you know the dam breaks okay now you can go after Friends of Bill and Hillary Clinton and so the first the first batch of them oh my gosh all liberal men you couldn't have gotten away with any of that in only if only I could have you know you've talked a lot about you when you're talking about the media and I agree with you I think the media is one of the biggest problems we have in the country I'm a absolute an absolutist when it comes to the First Amendment but they are so corrupt they need to reform themselves or be beaten into reforming what are the big lies I'm running out of time it could you give me a list of the big lies that you've been selling about Donald Trump that you as no great friend of trumps that you feel are just real big lie stuff well I'll do them roughly in order to one was the Access Hollywood tape it's a sexual assault it's a sexual assault he said they let you do it it was that the Access Hollywood tape is the perfect encapsulation of what they do they had a tape with with Tom sounding like a complete idiot and a bore but they can't just leave it at that no no we have to leap to it's a criminal offense and they were so the Titanic overreaction to the Access Hollywood tape I think if they the public had the same reaction I'm having right now to the false claim false claim in the case of Cavanaugh maybe it's unfair to compare them but the false claim against claims against Cavanaugh it's people end up being more outraged by the deliver of the new newse also of course the Access Hollywood tape the release of that the husbanding of it and recording of it that is not illegal very very illegal and certainly it's it's the same sort of thing as the allegation that the russians hacked the DNC's and emails and published them information the Democrats didn't want to come out that was embarrassing to them truthful came out before the election I mean that whole the everything the Russians are accused of is what the media does to Republicans everyone all right Ann Coulter you're the best I mean I look at all the young women coming up today you have become a genre I think you've created an entire generation of commentators it's always great talking to you thanks very much I gotta say the thing I love most about an aside from the fact that she is hotter than the hinges of hell because I'm a total sexist and I and a sucker for a pretty face and she's just gorgeous but but aside from that the thing I really love is she cuts nobody any slack she will support you if she agrees with you and she supported Trump because she feels that this that the situation at the border is a crisis you were an entire book about it adios America and she has taunted him on Twitter every single day every single day she taunts Trump on Twitter saying miles of wall built so far zero and she keeps a tweet and she has gotten into cursing four-letter word you know back and forth with him in the Oval Office and she just holds his feet to the fire if if he doesn't do the thing that he promised to do that was most important to her and you know when she talks about the press that he may actually destroy the press so we can reform it and get a more honest media in America which we really do need she's right that may be the most important thing he does alright time for sexual follies so if you follow The Drudge Report and everybody follows The Drudge Report it looks like it was printed in 1990 but it's just still it's still the essential new site on the Internet you may have noticed that Matt Drudge is a little bit obsessed with sex robots okay basically that's because they include both the word sex and robots and I think that's just very compelling but the thing about sex Rovers is it actually is an important issue in this funny way because of trend what they call transhumanism which is the fact that we are clearly heading into an age when human beings are going to be enhanced but we're by adding stuff to their brains and you putting you know attaching them to machines and sex robots are kind of part of that something that you can have what used to be a essentially human relationship you'll be now able to have with a machine and I think transhumanism is a big deal and one of the ways you can tell it's a big deal is because of so many you know when I was a kid all the movies were westerns and about world war ii because america was thinking about its past it was thinking about how we became the greatest nation in the world which when I was a kid we really had just become we were going to the moon where all this stuff was happening and so we westerns in world war ii were the two big subjects of the movies and of our games that we played where is now everything is superheroes everything is superheroes and science fiction as I predicted by the way that we are now thinking about superheroes in science fiction because we're thinking about how we're going to move into this new age when we become essentially superheroes but what are the ethical problems gonna be what are the moral problems going to be you know the the new are detective story the tough guy detective story which I made my living at for so many years is now usually like Blade Runner a detective story about the nature of humanity that is this mystery that the detective is trying to solve because transhumanism is right around the corner and people sense it coming and they sense it in their subconscious and creative people sense it and so they make these movies and that's what they feel that they're all about they're sort of preparing our minds for this to happen so with sex robots one of the reasons I think that Drudge is obsessed with it and so many people are obsessed with it is because it sort of is telling us that this relation ship that is so human is that the core of our humanity may now be shunted off or it may be possible to shunt it off into a machine and what does it mean so now there's now there are now people coming along who feel that sex robots have to be regulated that we have to prepare for sex robot ISM with regulations and the things they're talking about are you know should you be allowed to have a sex robot that is that makes noises as if she's being raped or should you be allowed to have a sex robot who looks like a child and what's really funny about this to me and I mean I know that's kind of sounds not that funny but it is kind of funny because how can you rape a robot I mean to rape somebody is to strip them of their will that is the crime of rape I mean rape is just you know is in terms of its actions if it's not violent rape is just sex what makes rape rape is that you were stripping somebody of their right to choose what they're gonna do or robot doesn't have that right at a robot can't make choices and what difference does it make if the robot looks like a child for all I know that's gonna help some you know pedophile take it out on a robot instead of a real human beings that are really damaging a human being it may be a positive thing that that he can do that and yet underneath all that underneath all that I can't help but feel that there is a question that robots like this and it questions about regulation bring up that is the discussion that we are having but not having you know remember I was talking yesterday about the fact that the left ruins everything by making all their discussions really battles for power they're not really talking about what we think we're talking about we're always talking about whether the left should get more power for the government and with this me to movement which has really become this weapon that they're wielding I mean I know they're really honest people in the me2 movement but it's now become this weapon that the left is wielding to get power underneath that is a question about the nature of women the nature of men it's also in this kind of transgender discussion what are we like and the reason I'm so opposed to feminism the reason I've always been so opposed to feminism is because I oppose its opposition to femininity because I think that masculinity and femininity are both things that we need in the world I think we need women to be feminine and we need men to be masculine because those two forces make the world whole and I think the conversation that we really need to be having is what is a human being and once we get finished with that we have to talk about what is a man and what is a woman because that's the conversation that's underneath the conversation we're having all right tomorrow is the mailbag be there you got to subscribe go to the
