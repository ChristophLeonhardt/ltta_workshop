Thanks to the internet,
everything seems knowable.
All of those little
mysteries that
used to fuel
conversation — Who
was that guy in that movie?
How big is the Pacific Ocean?
Do you think that
TV dog is dead now? —
are so easily solvable.
Now everyone can just
check their phone.
But there is one part of
the internet that is drawn
to things that
cannot be Googled.
The mystical internet
has arrived.
New apps like
Costar Astrology
and the Daily Hunch
are part of a suite
of internet products
rebranding the zodiac
for the digital set.
Astrological sign
memes dominate Twitter.
The Hoodwitch, an
online retailer who
sells everyday magic
for the modern mystic,
has amassed over 260,000
Instagram followers
for her hashtag
#witchtips and beautifully
staged tarot readings.
Even Spencer Pratt, the arch
villain of “The Hills,” has
reinvented himself as
a crystal outfitter.
“The tiger’s eye, 
I wear for protection,
and it worked, because I wore
this in the ‘Celebrity Big
Brother’ all-star house,
and I was super-protected.”
But a lot of the
appeal of this stuff
isn’t really based in
any strong held belief
in the occult.
You don’t have to 
actually believe
in astrology to be into it.
Putting aside whether
planetary alignments actually
influence the personal
lives of human beings,
astrology and other
nonscientific practices are
sometimes less about
predicting the future than
they are about helping
to understand ourselves.
Posting a hermit tarot
card to Instagram
is a way of signaling
introversion.
A piece of rose quartz
stone is an expression
of unconditional love.
“Love is who I am.”
And astrology, it’s basically
the cosmic Buzzfeed quiz.
In other words, this
is a content business
as much as it is a
spiritual practice.
There are for sure
enterprising capitalists
who are eager to profit
off of all of this.
 “These
eggs are on fire.”
Goop has built a whole 
online retail empire
serving what it
calls, “the divine feminine.”
“The egg is in, I think.”
But online mysticism is also
filling a legitimate need.
This is a turn to emotion in
the face of all of the data
that dominates the internet.
It’s a rejection of all the
algorithmic, data-driven,
hyper-logical,
crypto-libertarian values
that run so much of
what we do online.
In their place it
carves out room
for intuition and empathy.
And yeah, it all
feels pretty girly,
but men have their
online mysticism, too.
It just looks a little
more like this.
“And this is some
satanist imagery here
that goes over the connections
of this symbolism.”
And if masculine mysticism
is obsessed with
conspiracies, drawing 
connections between
historical events and 
random images,
feminine mysticism, 
on the internet at least,
seeks to draw spiritual 
connections
between human beings.
“I’m a Gemini, so
there’s two sides of me.”
I’m a Gemini, too,
so I’m of two minds
about this whole trend.
My curmudgeonly
twin points out
that this is all a ploy
to get women to spend more
money on useless stuff, but
my more compassionate twin
appreciates a corner
of the internet that
values justice and empathy.
“The horoscopes are
meant to be healing.”
After all, the woo-woo
crazy of a vagina
jade egg pales in
comparison to this.
“We believe the Earth was
a flattish disk surrounded
by a solid dome barrier
called the firmament.”
In this context, retreating
into the mystical internet
actually feels like a
quite rational move.
