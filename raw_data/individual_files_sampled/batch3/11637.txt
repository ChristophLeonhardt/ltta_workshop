at a rare case that a leader openly shows mistrust for his own country's legal system but that appears to be exactly what Canada's Prime Minister's done Justin Trudeau spoke out after a jury acquitted a white farmer who claimed he'd killed an indigenous man in self-defense I know I speak on behalf of millions of Canadians when I said that our hearts go out to Colton Bush's family his mom Debbie his friends and the entire community and I know indigenous and non-indigenous Canadians alike know that we have to do better Trudeau's comments have created something of a backlash one MP said politicians should not decide this type of thing others stress that there should be no political involvement in the judicial process and there's no excuse for undermining confidence in the judicial system according to one lawyer about said the Canadian Prime Minister's reaction has been echoed with furious rallies nationwide Colten boo she was shot dead when he and some friends went to get help with a flat tire they drove to the farm of Gerald Stanley but he thought the group wanted to rob him he reportedly tried to remove the keys from the car and accidentally shot twenty-two-year-old bushi the farmer was arrested and charged with second-degree murder no it's not just the country's prime minister who's been outraged by the verdict we are frustrated and were in shock you were hurt we feel betrayed this is a new to us however the not guilty verdict just highlighted and exposed the ugliness in the justice system here in Canada there's gonna be some action we're we're pushing for an appeal everybody has reason to be upset with this verdict a young man is dead over you know attempted break-in or whatever was happening there from this incident and we have absolutely no justice for the family it shows the lack of faith and trust and representation in that in that justice system for indigenous people and just for the pure fact that this gentleman was fully acquitted of these charges without any sort of responsibility for the fact that he had a loaded handgun near the head of a young gentleman who was not threatening him at the time left a lot of people wanting more and so there's a lot of pain in the community right now and a lot of sorrow and and that's also fomenting itself into anger and rage
