1
00:00:01,131 --> 00:00:02,999
WHICH LEAVES THEM WONDERING WHAT

2
00:00:02,999 --> 00:00:05,068
ELSE THEY DON'T KNOW.

3
00:00:05,068 --> 00:00:08,705
I'M SURE WE'LL BE COVERING IT.

4
00:00:08,705 --> 00:00:09,539
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THE REPORT

5
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:13,944
TOTALLY EXONERATES HIM.

6
00:00:13,944 --> 00:00:18,982
LET'S BRING IN TONIGHT'S PANEL.

7
00:00:18,982 --> 00:00:25,121
FORMER ADVISOR TO BILL  CLINTON.

8
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:26,423
>>  AN INTERESTING PIECE THAT

9
00:00:26,423 --> 00:00:32,695
YOU GUYS MAY HAVE READ, ANDY

10
00:00:32,695 --> 00:00:34,464
MCCARTHY, HE'S BEEN WRITING ON

11
00:00:34,464 --> 00:00:36,399
THESE ISSUES FOR MONTHS.

12
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,801
BASICALLY, HE SAID IT DIDN'T

13
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:41,104
SEEM LIKE COMMON SENSE TO HIM

14
00:00:41,104 --> 00:00:45,308
THAT THE IG WALKED US THROUGH

15
00:00:45,308 --> 00:00:47,010
EVERYTHING.

16
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,979
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE

17
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:51,081
ACTIONS THAT WERE TAKEN WERE

18
00:00:51,081 --> 00:00:51,448
JUSTIFIED.

19
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:52,415
THEY WERE REASONABLE.

20
00:00:52,415 --> 00:00:54,084
HE WRITES THAT'S JUST NOT COMMON

21
00:00:54,084 --> 00:00:54,384
SENSE.

22
00:00:54,384 --> 00:00:56,453
YOU CAN'T LOOK AT THINGS IN A

23
00:00:56,453 --> 00:00:56,786
VACUUM.

24
00:00:56,786 --> 00:00:57,587
AND OF COURSE THEY'RE CONNECTED.

25
00:00:57,587 --> 00:00:59,823
WHAT DO YOU SAY, MARK?

26
00:00:59,823 --> 00:01:02,592
>>  WELL, I THINK THE INSPECTOR

27
00:01:02,592 --> 00:01:06,963
GENERAL APPLIED A STANDARD OF

28
00:01:06,963 --> 00:01:08,064
JUSTIFICATION FOR EVERYTHING

29
00:01:08,064 --> 00:01:09,566
THAT WAS DONE AND HE CONCLUDED

30
00:01:09,566 --> 00:01:11,434
THAT THERE BY AND LARGE WAS A

31
00:01:11,434 --> 00:01:11,901
JUSTIFICATION.

32
00:01:11,901 --> 00:01:14,304
NOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT

33
00:01:14,304 --> 00:01:15,505
THE REPORT WITH THE SAME

34
00:01:15,505 --> 00:01:16,306
STANDARD THAT HE USED BECAUSE I

35
00:01:16,306 --> 00:01:17,907
THINK THAT YOU REALLY HAVE TO

36
00:01:17,907 --> 00:01:19,242
READ THE WHOLE REPORT TO SEE THE

37
00:01:19,242 --> 00:01:21,978
FACTS HERE AND THE CULTURE OF

38
00:01:21,978 --> 00:01:23,246
BIAS THAT WAS UNDERNEATH HIS

39
00:01:23,246 --> 00:01:23,847
FINDINGS.

40
00:01:23,847 --> 00:01:27,784
WHEN IT COMES TO PETER STRZOK,

41
00:01:27,784 --> 00:01:29,719
HE DOES SINGLE STRZOK OUT AND

42
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:34,657
SAY, WHEN IT COMES TO THE RUSSIA

43
00:01:34,657 --> 00:01:35,925
INVESTIGATION --

44
00:01:35,925 --> 00:01:37,093
HILLARY COMES OUT OF THIS PRETTY

45
00:01:37,093 --> 00:01:39,562
GOOD BECAUSE HE BASICALLY SAID

46
00:01:39,562 --> 00:01:41,364
THAT INVESTIGATION WAS JUSTIFIED

47
00:01:41,364 --> 00:01:42,365
AND IS BASICALLY OVER.

48
00:01:42,365 --> 00:01:43,400
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO

49
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,734
REPEAT THAT.

50
00:01:44,734 --> 00:01:46,536
BUT TRUMP ALSO COMES OUT OF THIS

51
00:01:46,536 --> 00:01:48,171
PRETTY GOOD BECAUSE IT LOOKS

52
00:01:48,171 --> 00:01:51,007
LIKE THERE'S SOME REAL BIAS

53
00:01:51,007 --> 00:01:54,044
GOING INTO THE RUSSIA

54
00:01:54,044 --> 00:01:54,477
INVESTIGATION.

55
00:01:54,477 --> 00:01:55,979
>>  THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY SAYS

56
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,947
MOST QUESTIONS PERTAIN TO THE

57
00:01:57,947 --> 00:01:59,149
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.

58
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:01,084
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE

59
00:02:01,084 --> 00:02:01,518
INVESTIGATING.

60
00:02:01,518 --> 00:02:05,889
AND THE  IMPLICATION IN SOME OF

61
00:02:05,889 --> 00:02:11,026
THESE TEXT MESSAGES WAS THAT

62
00:02:11,026 --> 00:02:13,663
STRZOK MIGHT BE WILLING TO TAKE

63
00:02:13,663 --> 00:02:17,067
OFFICIAL ACTION TO IMPACT A

64
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:18,234
CANDIDATE'S PRESIDENTIAL

65
00:02:18,234 --> 00:02:18,601
PROSPECT.

66
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:21,071
DOES IT LEAVE A DOOR OPEN FOR

67
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:21,337
YOU?

68
00:02:21,337 --> 00:02:22,939
>>  I THINK THE BIGGEST THING I

69
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:24,607
LEARNED IS THAT WE FAILED TO

70
00:02:24,607 --> 00:02:27,043
REMEMBER SOME BASIC THINGS, THAT

71
00:02:27,043 --> 00:02:28,445
THE VERY TOP PEOPLE AT THE FBI,

72
00:02:28,445 --> 00:02:30,346
THE DIRECTOR AND THE DEPUTY

73
00:02:30,346 --> 00:02:32,082
DIRECTOR WERE FIRED, THAT THESE

74
00:02:32,082 --> 00:02:36,019
OTHER AGENTS THAT ARE REFERRED

75
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:37,687
TO IN THE IG REPORT HAD VERY

76
00:02:37,687 --> 00:02:39,422
SENIOR POSITIONS IN THE FBI AND

77
00:02:39,422 --> 00:02:41,324
THEY ARE VERY, VERY AGGRESSIVE

78
00:02:41,324 --> 00:02:43,760
BY INJECTING POLITICS INTO ALL

79
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,662
OF THESE DECISIONS, SHANNON.

80
00:02:45,662 --> 00:02:48,064
AND I THINK WHAT REALLY STRUCK

81
00:02:48,064 --> 00:02:52,302
ME BY READING BOTH PIECES IS

82
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:54,337
THAT THERE WAS THAT ONE TWEET --

83
00:02:54,337 --> 00:02:57,507
OR EXCUSE ME, THAT ONE MESSAGE,

84
00:02:57,507 --> 00:02:58,942
WHEN TED CRUZ DROPS OUT AND

85
00:02:58,942 --> 00:03:00,477
THERE'S THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT,

86
00:03:00,477 --> 00:03:03,179
"OH, NOW WE'VE REALLY GOT TO GET

87
00:03:03,179 --> 00:03:06,082
SERIOUS ON THE MIDTERM REVIEW

88
00:03:06,082 --> 00:03:07,784
AND WE'VE GOT TO STOP TRUMP."

89
00:03:07,784 --> 00:03:09,319
SO WHAT THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION

90
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,087
WAS NEVER REALLY AN

91
00:03:11,087 --> 00:03:11,521
INVESTIGATION.

92
00:03:11,521 --> 00:03:12,622
IT WAS NEVER REALLY ABOUT

93
00:03:12,622 --> 00:03:13,823
FINDING WRONGDOINGS.

94
00:03:13,823 --> 00:03:18,027
IT WAS ABOUT THE POLITICS OF

95
00:03:18,027 --> 00:03:18,495
STOPPING TRUMP.

96
00:03:18,495 --> 00:03:20,763
AND WHERE I DISAGREE A LITTLE

97
00:03:20,763 --> 00:03:22,365
BIT IS IT'S THE POLAR OPPOSITE

98
00:03:22,365 --> 00:03:24,167
WHEN IT COMES TO HILLARY.

99
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:25,902
IT WAS ABOUT CLEARING HILLARY SO

100
00:03:25,902 --> 00:03:27,270
SHE COULD STOP DONALD TRUMP.

101
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,671
IT WAS ALL ABOUT GETTING TRUMP.

102
00:03:28,671 --> 00:03:30,607
AND TRUMP CALLED IT FOR WHAT IT

103
00:03:30,607 --> 00:03:31,007
WAS.

104
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:32,709
AND I CAN SEE WHY HE FEELS LIKE

105
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:34,410
THIS REPORT MAKES THE WHOLE IDEA

106
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,079
OF HAVING A SPECIAL COUNSEL

107
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:38,848
PRETTY SILLY.

108
00:03:38,848 --> 00:03:40,583
>>  BEN SHAPIRO WRITES THIS.

109
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:43,953
I'M NOT MAKING THE CASE THAT

110
00:03:43,953 --> 00:03:47,524
THERE WAS A CONSPIRACY, BUT IT

111
00:03:47,524 --> 00:03:50,960
IS OBVIOUS FROM THE AVAILABLE

112
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,963
EVIDENCE THAT ONE FELT THE

113
00:03:53,963 --> 00:03:55,265
NECESSITY TO STOP TRUMP FROM

114
00:03:55,265 --> 00:03:56,166
BECOMING PRESIDENT.

115
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,935
AND THE LEADING ACTORS INSIDE

116
00:03:58,935 --> 00:04:00,803
THE FBI ASSUMED HILLARY WOULD BE

117
00:04:00,803 --> 00:04:02,805
PRESIDENT AROUND TAILORED THEIR

118
00:04:02,805 --> 00:04:04,507
ACTIONS BASED ON THAT

119
00:04:04,507 --> 00:04:05,108
ASSUMPTION.

120
00:04:05,108 --> 00:04:07,343
THE IG GOES BEFORE THE SENATE

121
00:04:07,343 --> 00:04:09,512
AND HOUSE ON MONDAY.

122
00:04:09,512 --> 00:04:11,548
WHAT DO YOU THINK HE'LL GET

123
00:04:11,548 --> 00:04:11,848
ASKED?

124
00:04:11,848 --> 00:04:13,883
>>  DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO SAY,

125
00:04:13,883 --> 00:04:15,718
NO BIAS, NO BIAS.

126
00:04:15,718 --> 00:04:16,452
WASN'T THIS REASONABLE?

127
00:04:16,452 --> 00:04:17,387
IT WAS REASONABLE.

128
00:04:17,387 --> 00:04:18,488
REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO DO

129
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:20,356
EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE AND SAY,

130
00:04:20,356 --> 00:04:22,258
HOW COULD YOU SAY THIS IS

131
00:04:22,258 --> 00:04:22,659
REASONABLE?

132
00:04:22,659 --> 00:04:26,763
HE'S GOING TO PLAY IT RIGHT DOWN

133
00:04:26,763 --> 00:04:27,263
THE MIDDLE.

134
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,464
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S GOING TO

135
00:04:28,464 --> 00:04:29,966
GET AN ADVANTAGE, EXCEPT HE

136
00:04:29,966 --> 00:04:32,068
REALLY SLAMS COMEY.

137
00:04:32,068 --> 00:04:34,003
AND SO I THINK WE COULD REALLY

138
00:04:34,003 --> 00:04:38,208
EXPECT HIM TO BE CONSISTENT.

139
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,609
THE ACTUAL STORY OF COMEY HIDING

140
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:41,611
WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO FROM THE

141
00:04:41,611 --> 00:04:42,979
ATTORNEY GENERAL IS INCREDIBLE.

142
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:44,547
I COULDN'T EVEN WRITE THAT FOR A

143
00:04:44,547 --> 00:04:46,950
MOVIE SCRIPT, THAT HE'S GOING TO

144
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,586
RUSH TO THE MICROPHONE, NEVER

145
00:04:49,586 --> 00:04:50,987
TELL THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO HE

146
00:04:50,987 --> 00:04:52,055
REPORTS TO.

147
00:04:52,055 --> 00:04:54,857
THAT IS MORE THAN

148
00:04:54,857 --> 00:04:55,325
INSUBORDINATION.

149
00:04:55,325 --> 00:04:56,626
>>  YEAH, AND I THINK THE OTHER

150
00:04:56,626 --> 00:04:58,228
POINT IT MAKES IS THAT FOR ALL

151
00:04:58,228 --> 00:05:00,430
THOSE DEMOCRATS WHO HAVE BEEN

152
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,565
SAYING SOMEHOW THE FBI IS OVER

153
00:05:02,565 --> 00:05:05,868
HERE ISOLATED BY ITSELF, IT

154
00:05:05,868 --> 00:05:07,403
REALLY REMINDS EVERYONE THAT THE

155
00:05:07,403 --> 00:05:09,772
FBI REPORTS TO THE DOJ, WHICH

156
00:05:09,772 --> 00:05:11,241
REPORTS TO THE PRESIDENT TRUMP

157
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:12,976
OF THE UNITED STATES.

158
00:05:12,976 --> 00:00:00,000
IT IS CALLED THE EXECUTIVE
