Hi friends, Let’s begin.
When you’re starting anything, one of the

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:09,869
toughest things to swallow is that you’re
going to suck. Ira Glass talks about it in

3
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:15,129
a speech of his that went viral and my friend
Katherine talks about it a vlog of hers, both

4
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:16,670
of which I’ll link below.

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:22,519
So okay, intellectually, you know this. Beginners
are BEGINNERS. Not experts, right? So why

6
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:28,119
do you still feel the gnawing pain of inadequacy
deep with in your soul and by you I mean me,

7
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:30,009
I feel very inadequate.

8
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:35,710
When I first started making youtube videos
in 2011, I wanted to be an artist. Now, I’m

9
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:41,710
a shitty artist. But every day for 30 days
in a row I made a piece of art and I filmed

10
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,840
myself making it and I put it up on youtube
for the entire internet to see and in the

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,760
course of those 30 days I became a slightly
less shitty, but let’s be clear, still shitty

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,149
artist.

13
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:57,449
But you know what? I’m not embarrassed of
those videos. Not at all. I’m as proud of

14
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:03,039
them as anything else I’ve ever put up online.
I decided one day that I wanted to try something

15
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,610
and then I just did it. I learned a lot and grew a lot and started down

16
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,880
the bizarre and windy path to this going on
right here right now 

17
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,580
That’s more than most can say.
And so I don’t feel scared of trying new

18
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,190
things on here anymore.

19
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:21,050
But in the last year I started a videography
business, and when I look at the work of people

20
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:25,570
who are much more talented and accomplished
than I am I start to tell myself that I’m

21
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,290
terrible and that I’ll never, ever be as
good as they are.

22
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,950
I’ve gotten a massive case of imposter syndrome
– that feeling that you’re a fraud and

23
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:40,950
a hack and you’re just moments away from
being found out and then cast off into oblivion.

24
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,400
And you feel that too, then you’re in luck
because its one of the most universal feelings

25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,500
in the human experience. We’re all imposters
here.

26
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,390
But you wanna know the only way to cure imposter
syndrome?

27
00:01:53,390 --> 00:02:00,390
Suck. Suck frequently. Suck publically, even.
Suck loudly and visibly and dear god, Taylor,

28
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,700
CONTEXT.

29
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:14,269
So go forth and be terrible at something. And then be less
terrible. And then be okay, and then be really

30
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:21,269
fucking good. But first you have to
suck, and before you suck you have to begin.

be friends. The usual social
media bullsnazz is in the links below. Tell me

33
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:36,099
down in the comments something you are beginning
right now and/or something you feel like an

34
00:02:36,099 --> 00:00:00,000
impostor at, and I will see you next week.
Goodbye!
