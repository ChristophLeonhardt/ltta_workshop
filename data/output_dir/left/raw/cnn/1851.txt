1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,959
senator amid these tensions we've been
talking about with North Korea this

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,500
morning the Washington Post is reporting
the president Trump has instructed

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,750
advisers to prepare to withdraw from a
free trade agreement with South Korea do

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,560
you think that's the right thing to do
now no not at all

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,880
I don't think that that would be good in
any circumstances now it's particularly

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,189
troubling given what South Korea is
faced with I think we need to do more

7
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,539
trade not less and withdrawing from
trade agreements is a very troubling

8
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:36,300
sign I want to ask you about what's
known as daca the Obama era program that

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,829
shields young documented immigrants who
were brought by the u.s. brought to the

10
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:45,270
u.s. rather by their parents shields
them from deportation you tweeted at the

11
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,770
following on Friday Congress needs to
take immediate action to protect protect

12
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,449
daca kids but let me show you what
President Trump promised during the

13
00:00:54,449 --> 00:01:03,059
campaign in your home state of Arizona
we will immediately terminate President

14
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:10,880
Obama's two illegal executive amnesty in
which he defied federal law and the

15
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,420
Constitution to give amnesty to
approximately 5 million illegal

16
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,990
immigrants 5 million senator the
president said he's going to make a

17
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,159
decision soon why should he go back on
this promise which was very popular

18
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,920
among Republicans in places like your
state because of a beautiful right the

19
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,750
right thing to do to go back on a
promise

20
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,920
obviously you you hope that presidents
keep some of their campaign promises and

21
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,700
you hope that they ignore others this is
one that he ought to ignore there are

22
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:49,409
800,000 daca kids kids who have brought
across the border the median age I think

23
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,040
is six years old
for those 800,000 when they came across

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,630
the border they should not be punished
for the sins of their parents that's

25
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,369
just the the basic principle that we
ought to follow here they are in either

26
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:07,259
in school or have graduated and are
working almost all of them think 90 some

27
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,120
percent of them are in the work force to
remove them from the country to split up

28
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,500
families like this is just not the
way we ought to go it's senator if the

29
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,850
president says that he will extend the
protections for dreamers but do it in

30
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,620
exchange for funding from Congress from
you for his border wall would you go

31
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:31,530
along with that compromise obviously all
of us believe in border security it

32
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,550
depends on what he means by the wall and
we still really haven't seen what he

33
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:40,650
means by the wall if that's a metaphor
for border security we can certainly

34
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:46,620
support that but if he's talking about a
solitary brick and mortar 2,000 mile the

35
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,840
edifice on the border then no nobody
ought to support that so we really

36
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,340
haven't seen what the president is
really talking about when he talks about

37
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:03,420
the wall let's talk about you and
President Trump he really is on a

38
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,650
mission to defeat your re-election as a
fellow Republican he's called you a

39
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,190
flake
he says you're toxic and he has promoted

40
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,450
your Republican primary opponent Kelly
Ward I want you to listen to more of

41
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,600
what the president said about you on
your home turf just this past week

42
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:26,820
nobody wants me to talk about your other
senator who's weak on borders weak on

43
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:34,860
crime so I won't talk about him nobody
knows who the hell is senator what makes

44
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,060
you think that you can win your
Republican primary in your state with

45
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,150
the president attacking you and you
going after him the people in Arizona

46
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:50,100
tend to elect independent minded
principled senators Barry Goldwater John

47
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:56,040
McCain I think the voters here expect me
to have my own franchise to represent

48
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,200
them not to be a rubber stamp for the
president so I'm quite comfortable being

49
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,610
where I am I would hate to be tethered
to any president Republican or Democrat

50
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:09,810
and every position they take that's not
what a senator is supposed to do but

51
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:15,840
Senator 88% of Republicans in your home
state of Arizona voted for Donald Trump

52
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,029
in November you might be right about the
general voters in Arizona but we're

53
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:25,770
talking about an intra Republican war
that it one of the battlefields is right

54
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,220
there and you're
leading the charge against the Trump the

55
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,349
Trump voters no that's not that's not
the case

56
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:38,069
what I'm doing is voting on a
conservative basis that's my philosophy

57
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:42,599
I will support the president what I
believe he's right I've supported many

58
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:46,620
of the agenda items that he's put
forward I'll oppose those that I think

59
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,330
he's wrong on things like NAFTA for
example I think NAFTA has been good for

60
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,409
Arizona has been good for Mexico it's
been good for Canada it's been good to

61
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:59,699
the entire country those kind of things
that will damage Arizona I won't support

62
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,659
the president on but on most things I do
that's what I do with every president

63
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:09,060
that's what the voters in Arizona expect
me to do senator I want to turn before I

64
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:15,440
let you go to Russia and escalating
tensions with Russia officials there are

65
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:22,319
protesting American intentions to search
Russian diplomatic facility is one here

66
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,770
in Washington in particular and they
call it a hostile act but do you think

67
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,900
that Russia's interference in America's
election wasn't that just that a hostile

68
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,650
act
well obviously Russia did try to

69
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:40,139
intervene and did try to meddle in our
elections that's a settled matter what

70
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,400
we do with regard to diplomatic
facilities is governed by conventions

71
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,330
and protocols that are in place
obviously we don't run afoul of those

72
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:53,339
and and Russia shouldn't either
but Russia is an adversary I think that

73
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:58,770
we we ought to if we don't we ought to
continue to recognize that so I'm

74
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:04,169
certainly supportive of us recognizing
them as an adversary and lastly senator

75
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:08,729
the leaders here in Washington your
Republican leaders the White House

76
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:15,719
they're preparing to attach potentially
attach this popular bill to help victims

77
00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:20,159
of hurricane Harvey to a controversial
measure to increase the nation's debt

78
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:25,259
limit do you support this move well we
don't know how it's going to come

79
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:31,229
forward I know that we desperately need
to help those who have been through this

80
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:38,279
horrific situation in Texas and
Louisiana will do so we'll also raise

81
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,320
the debt ceiling raising the debt
ceiling

82
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,810
is it simply paying for bills that
you've already accrued we obviously need

83
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:51,810
to be concerned about our growing
deficit and our massive debt but but the

84
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:56,460
debt limit is not the place to do that
on and and obviously we've got to

85
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,040
provide assistance to those in Texas in
Louisiana

86
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:05,100
okay just to be clear you are okay with
you will support financial assistance

87
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:10,320
federal assistance for Harvey Oh
obviously what we're talking about this

88
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:16,320
coming week is immediate emergency
assistance kind of the down payment and

89
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,070
I don't think you'll have much argument
there okay senator thank you so much

90
00:07:20,070 --> 00:00:00,000
appreciate your time this morning
