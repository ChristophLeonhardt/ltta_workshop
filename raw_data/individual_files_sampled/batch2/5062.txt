the Trump era can feel like a dystopia come to life a never-ending series of conflicts United not so much by any organizing topic but a march of do basements that corrode public faith in our very system of government how many of course are countering the challenges of Trump with facts with protests with attempts and accountability but if cultural history teaches us anything it's we need more than rules at a time like this we need art we need absurdity because distress societies do need inspiration we need shared reasons to look at challenges the new and maybe even laugh along the way which brings me to the celebrated Academy award-winning actor Sean Penn known for his riveting performances in films like dead man walking Mystic River and milk and now he's taking on a fictional president with some echos of Trump in a new novel Bob honey who just do stuff novelist Salman Rushdie calls it a book that is both dystopian and a great fun to read Sean Penn joins me on the beat thanks for being here thanks for having me what are you saying with this novel I think essentially it's a love letter to the best of this country disguised as an equal-opportunity high offender when you look at a fictional president that in this book tweets that has echoes of Trump why take on Trump that way as opposed to with facts or though other ways people are doing it right now well I think the book is much more much less reflective of any particular individual than it is a kind of lament about the you know a humorous lament about where we've come as a culture at large the leaders are results of all of that and it's a kind of it's a cry for mutual accountability which goes to a passenger I want to read which which folks can interpret for themselves but talking about the character who is based it appears at times on Trump you say quote many wonderful American people in pain and rage elected you addressing this person many Russians did too though the office will remain real you never were nor will be tell me what what you're doing there what you mean by real I think we're talking about at large is where we've become a society so invested in branding the people themselves exist only as a brand how do you as an artist approach that insight when you are also too many people Sean Penn a brand a figure not just a human being yeah I mean I think there's there's two ways to live a life one is to be in in pursuit of being a brand and the other one is to fight run as much as you can are you never gonna win entirely because people are going to have their perceptions of you you may also have you know in one way or another created a perception of one that one of oneself why did so many Americans then want to literally elect a brand because Donald Trump if nothing else was known for the name on buildings he didn't own well certainly we've come to a point where the those things once considered my principles of integrity are considered a fool's game and I think that the way in which the culture has become enamored with that celebrity I kind - think about this president the way that the audience meaning the electorate were it a Batman movie this is them rooting for the Joker against their own interests and and looking to beat Batman down where they go in the movie theater and while they might enjoy the colorful quality of a performance of a joker they want Batman to win and I think that the transfer from what we want in our real lives and what we want in our fantasy life has become a kind of poisonous counterpoint your book has definitely stirred up debate already there are people who really don't like it and we know that from a new ad here this is in the New York Times and other papers that your publisher is running so this is pretty unusual the first quote says from Marie Claire honestly shut your face Sean Penn another says quote Sean Penn the novelists must be stopped is this book Bob honey wildly offensive quote it is and then some of them speak to the way art can be more than one thing I'll keep reading this to you to prolong the awkwardness of this moment John quote entertaining and maddening an equal measure perplexing and unquantifiable by design and the Guardian says repellent on one level but stupid on simple many others tell me about your reaction this reaction and why it's an ad in The Times I do like this a lot and it's it's it kind of makes me feel like yes I did it I also know what the perception of me is and how what is the Pacific's and others well I get let me say it this way badly because that said I don't want to bore anybody with my sense of I think I think I understand what a large perception is the the author James smiley said something fantastic and it got me thinking she said after reading the book she thought that this was gonna be about 25 75 25 percent of the people that read the book we're gonna love it and the other and the other 75 were gonna love it and I thought well that's a much better ratio than I'm had in my personal relationships it's a victory for me while you're here I want to talk to you about the drug war and El Chapo it's something you've worked a lot on it's something we cover on this show you're 60 minutes on el chapo was one of the most seen 60 minutes until stormy Daniels talked about a news hook comparison let's take a look January 8th when the Mexican Marines finally raided El Chapo's hideout as seen in this video they caught him as he attempted still another escape Chapo's arrest raised questions about whether the actor and actress had been tracked and helped lead the Mexican Marines to the drug lord Mexico's Attorney General claimed they had been quote essential there are irrational people and so I can't say for sure you know that there's no risk you were talking about the process that went into your lengthy and much-discussed article this is now an issue in El Chapo's trial I'm reading from what federal prosecutors say they're asking a judge to block jurors from even reading Sean Penn's article about El Chapo arguing that presenting it to jurors would quote draw sympathy for the defendant El Chapo number one do you think the jurors should be able to read your article and number two what do you see as you look at him facing justice in an American courtroom first I would say that it's that it it represents a misreading of my piece largely what I found is that most who had reported on the piece in the first place there was evidence that they'd never read it that they'd read excerpts of it and sort of regurgitated those what my position about whether or not jurors should be able to read this is as a legal issue and I think that it's not for me to say we love having you on the beach Sean Penn the book is Bob honey who just do stuff some people like it and some people don't as we've discussed with Sean thank you for being here thanks very much hey they're armed Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
