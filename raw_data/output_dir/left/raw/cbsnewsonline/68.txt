1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,037
SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR THAT. 

2
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:05,638
I MEAN, IT MAY SOUND LIKE OH 

3
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:06,272
THEY'RE BEING EVASIVE BUT I 

4
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:07,207
HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS 

5
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:09,442
WHEN THE GUYS AND MEN AND WOMEN 

6
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:11,311
GET ON THE SUPREME COURT. 

7
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:11,978
EVERYONE THOUGHT THAT JUSTICE 

8
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:14,080
ANTHONY KENNEDY WAS GOING TO BE 

9
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,251
A KEY VOTE TO OVERTURN ROW VERY 

10
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:19,686
SIS WIDE AND WHEN HE GET ON THE 

11
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,888
SUPREME COURT HE ACTUALLY GOT A 

12
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:23,889
CASE WHERE THIS WAS BEFORE 

13
00:00:23,889 --> 00:00:24,457
THEM. 

14
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:25,091
HE LOOKED AT THE DOCUMENTS AND 

15
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:25,658
INITIALLY THOUGHT TESTIFIES 

16
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:26,993
GOING TO VOTE TO OVERTURN IT 

17
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:31,264
AND HE CHANGED HIS MIND AND HE 

18
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:34,167
WAS A KEY VOTE TO UPHOLD ROE. 

19
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:35,201
THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID 

20
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,936
FOR WHEN YOU ARE ACTUALLY 

21
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:38,304
LOOKING AT THE CASE AND HAVE TO 

22
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:39,171
DECIDE IT. 

23
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:42,976
YOU MAY NOT KNOW HOW YOU ARE 

24
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:43,343
GOING TO RULE. 

25
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:46,012
>> JAN WHAT IS SORT OF 

26
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:46,545
DIFFERENT ABOUT KAVANAUGH 

27
00:00:46,545 --> 00:00:49,182
THOUGH IS HE'S WORKED IN AT 

28
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:49,849
LEAST ONE ADMINISTRATION RIGHT? 

29
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:50,884
HE WORKED IN THE BUSH 

30
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:51,317
ADMINISTRATION. 

31
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:52,919
THE OTHER ISSUE OF CONCERN FOR 

32
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,754
THOSE WHO ARE NOT SO SUPPORTIVE 

33
00:00:54,754 --> 00:01:00,125
OF HIM AS A NOMINEE IS HIS 

34
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:00,726
FEELINGS ABOUT PRESIDENTS AND 

35
00:01:00,726 --> 00:01:02,795
WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL BE 

36
00:01:02,795 --> 00:01:03,596
CRIMINALLY INDICTED OR SUED 

37
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:05,698
WHILE IN OFFICE CIVILLY. 

38
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:07,967
AND THAT WAS BASED ON AN ARM 

39
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,035
THAT HE WROTE. 

40
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:09,902
BUT ARTICLE THAT HE WROTE. 

41
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:11,971
BUT I KNOW THAT USUALLY THE 

42
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:14,240
HEARINGS COUNTY OF FOLLOW A 

43
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,911
FORMAT BUT COULD THINGS BE A 

44
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:18,578
LITTLE DIFFERENT BECAUSE IN 

45
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,145
THIS CASTOCK GNAW ACTUALLY 

46
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:20,980
WORKED IN THE WHITE HOUSE -- 

47
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,247
KAVANAUGH ACTUALLY WORKED IN 

48
00:01:22,247 --> 00:01:22,648
THE WHITE HOUSE? 

49
00:01:22,648 --> 00:01:23,315

AROUND. 

53
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:31,491
THAT'S WHY REPUBLICANS AREN'T 

54
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,692
GOING TO BUDGEN DOCUMENTS 

55
00:01:33,692 --> 00:01:37,330

00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:23,316

I ASSUME THIS WILL BE AROUND 

190
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,253

00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,822
COINCIDE WITH A FLOOR VOTE 

192
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:30,256
ALREADY SCHEDULED. 

193
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:34,861
THIS WOULD BE A THREE MINUTE --

00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:37,396
30 MINUTE BREAK. 

195
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:37,829

196
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:40,666
BUT JUDGE, IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO 

197
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,969

OUR COUNTRY. 

216
00:07:33,485 --> 00:07:34,620
THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED 

217
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,389

NOMINATION. 

236
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,731
THERE IS NO DISPUTE THAT YOU 

237
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:20,266

238
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:20,766

239
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,368
SOME PEOPLE SAY THE MOST 

240
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:25,471
QUALIFIED AND I DON'T DISAGREE 

241
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:29,742
WITH THEIR JUDGMENT AND THAT 

242
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:32,278
COULD BE FOR ANYBODY COMING 

243
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,712
BEFORE THE UNITED STATES 

244
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:33,946
SENATE. 

245
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,313
NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO SAYS THAT 

246
00:08:35,313 --> 00:08:36,849
BECAUSE WE HAVE A WILL THER 

247
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,086

SURPRISINGLY PRESIDENT

PRESIDENT CLIPTON. 

255
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:50,395
HE WROTE A VERY STRONG LETTER 

256
00:08:50,395 --> 00:08:52,665

257
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:53,599
QUALIFIED PERSON IN ANY

00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,301
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT COULD

00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,435
POSSIBLY HAVE NOMINATEDDABLE OR 

260
00:08:56,435 --> 00:09:02,875
THE SENATE TO FILE TO CONFIRM 

261
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,710
BRETT, IT WOULD NOT ONLY MEAN 

262
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,679
PASSING UP THE OPPORTUNITY TO 

263
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,849
CONFIRM A GREAT JURIST BUT ALSO 

264
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,083
UNDERSTOOD MINE CIVILITY IN 

265
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,586
POLITICS TWICE OVER. 

266
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:14,920
FIRST IN PLAYING POLITICS WITH 

267
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,122
SUCH AN OBVIOUSLY CONGRESSWOMAN 

268
00:09:17,122 --> 00:09:18,824

ADVOCATE OF DECENCY AND 

272
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,035
CIVILITY ON THE NATION'S 

273
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:29,701
HIGHEST COURT. 

274
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:31,870
MR. BENNETT ALSO SPEAKS HIGHLY 

275
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,571
OF YOUR INTEGRITY. 

276
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:37,209
AND TO YOUR FAIRNESS AND OPEN-

277
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:37,509
MINDEDNESS. 

278
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:38,844
AND SO WITHOUT OBJECTION, I 

279
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:43,382
WOULD ENTER THAT LETTER IN THE 

280
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:43,615
RECORD. 

281
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:44,283
NOW TO A QUESTION. 

282
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,752
I IMAGINE THAT YOUR 12 YEARS OF 

283
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,754
JUDICIAL SERVICE ON THE SECOND 

284
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,523
HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND HAS 

285
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:53,759
GIVEN YOU PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY 

286
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,560
TO THINK ABOUT MY FIRST 

287
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,196
QUESTION WHICH IS WHAT MAKES A 

288
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:58,597
JUDGE A GOOD ONE? 

289
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:01,267
AND WHAT INFLUENCES IN YOUR 

290
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,235
LIFE CAN SHAPED YOUR VISION OF 

291
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:07,306
HOW A JUDGE SHOULD GO ABOUT 

292
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:08,374
DOING HIS JOB? 

293
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,643
>> THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 

294
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:11,944
I YOU THIS THE FIRST QUALITY OF 

295
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,480
-- THINK THE FIRST QUALITY OF A 

296
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,517
JUDGE IN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL 

297
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:19,384
SYSTEM IS INDEPENDENCE. 

298
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:21,520
INDEPENDENCE COMES DIRECTLY 

299
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,423
FROM ARTICLE 3 OF THE 

300
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:25,357
CONSTITUTION. 

301
00:10:25,357 --> 00:10:26,392
THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE FEDERAL 

302
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,693
JUDGES REALLY IS GUARANTEED BY 

303
00:10:28,693 --> 00:10:32,131
THE FRAMERS IN OUR LIFE TENURE. 

304
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,800
AND OUR PROTECTION FROM PAY 

305
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,100
REDUCTION. 

306
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,469
SO BECAUSE WE HAVE LIFE TENURE, 

307
00:10:37,469 --> 00:10:42,241
WE ARE INDENT AND IMMUNE FROM 

308
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,508
POLITICAL OR PUBLIC PRESSURE. 

309
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:47,213
I THINK THE FIST THAT MANGES A 

310
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,514
GOOD JUDGE IS INDEPENDENCE. 

311
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:49,815
NOT BEING SWAYED BY POLITICAL 

312
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,382
OR PUBLIC PRESSURE. 

313
00:10:50,382 --> 00:10:52,651
THAT TAKES SOME BACKBONE AND 

314
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:53,118
JUDICIAL FORTITUDE. 

315
00:10:53,118 --> 00:10:56,021
THE GREAT MOMENTS IN AMERICAN 

316
00:10:56,021 --> 00:10:58,356
JUDICIAL HISTORY. 

317
00:10:58,356 --> 00:11:02,628
THE JUDGES HAD BACKBONE AND 

318
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:02,961
INDEPENDENCE. 

319
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:04,563
I THINK ABOUT YOUNGSTOWN STEEL 

320
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,398
AND YOU THINK ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE 

321
00:11:06,398 --> 00:11:08,601
BROWN VERSUS BOARD OF 

322
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,169
EDUCATION. 

323
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:10,802
OR THE COURT CAME TOGETHER AND 

324
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:13,038
KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO FACE 

325
00:11:13,038 --> 00:11:14,640
POLITICAL PRESSURE AND STILL 

326
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,378
ENFORCED THE PROMISE OF THE 

327
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:20,012
CONSTITUTION. 

328
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,246
YOU THINK ABOUT UNITE VERSUS 

329
00:11:21,246 --> 00:11:21,480
NIXON. 

330
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,648
WOULD HAVE BEEN THE GREATEST 

331
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:27,486
AMERICANS IN -- ONE OF THE 

332
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:29,888
GREATEST MOMENTS IN AMERICAN 

333
00:11:29,888 --> 00:11:30,956
JUICETIST HISTORY. 

334
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:32,624
WHERE -- JUSTICE HISTORY. 

335
00:11:32,624 --> 00:11:33,626
WHERE HE BROUGHT THE COURT TOM 

336
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,728
IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION TO 

337
00:11:36,728 --> 00:11:37,562
ORDER PRESIDENT NIXON IN 

338
00:11:37,562 --> 00:11:40,099
RESPOND A CRIMINAL TIME 

339
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:41,734
SUBPOENA TO DISCLOSE 

340
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:42,434
INFORMATION. 

341
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:44,369
THE GREAT MOMENTS OF 

342
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:44,970
INDEPENDENCE ARE IMPORTANT. 

343
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,972
RESPECT FOR PRECEDENT IS 

344
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:47,305
ANOTHER ONE. 

345
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:49,608
WE ARE A SYSTEM OF 

346
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:50,141
CONSTITUTIONAL PRECEDENT. 

347
00:11:50,141 --> 00:11:52,244
PRECEDENT IS NOT JUST A 

348
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:52,644
JUDICIAL POLICY. 

349
00:11:52,644 --> 00:11:57,950
IT'S SOMETIMES SATED IT'S JUST 

350
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:58,350
A POLLTY. 

351
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,618
PRESTON COUPLES RIGHT FROM 

352
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,954
ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONSTITUTION. 

353
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:03,189
ARTICLE 3 REFERS TO THE 

354
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:03,656
JUDICIAL POWER. 

355
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:06,559
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN AND WHAT 

356
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,459
DOES JUDICIAL POWER MEAN? 

357
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:10,930
JUDICIAL POWER YOU LOOK AT 

358
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:11,330
FEDERALIST 78. 

359
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:15,868
AND WHAT DESCRIBED THERE IS A 

360
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:16,335
SYSTEM OF PRECEDENT. 

361
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:21,507
PRECEDENT IS ROOTED RIGHT INTO 

362
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,209
THE CONSTITUTION ITSELF. 

363
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:24,343
AND THIS CONSTITUTIONALLY DATED 

364
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:25,477
TO PAY ATTENTION AND 

365
00:12:25,477 --> 00:12:26,478
CONSTITUTION AND RULES OF 

366
00:12:26,478 --> 00:12:26,778
PRECEDENT. 

367
00:12:26,778 --> 00:12:28,414
BEYOND THAT, BEING A GOOD JUDGE 

368
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,316
MEANS PAYING ATTENTION TO THE 

369
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,017
WORDS THAT ARE WRITTEN. 

370
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:33,853
THE WORDS OF THE CONSTITUTION. 

371
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,922
THE WORDS OF THE STATUTES THAT 

372
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,290
ARE PASSED BY CONGRESS. 

373
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,525
NOT DOING WHAT I WANT TO DO. 

374
00:12:40,525 --> 00:12:42,094
NOT DEFERRING WHEN THE 

375
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,729
EXECUTIVE REWRITES THE LAWS 

376
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:44,396
PASSED BY CONGRESS. 

377
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:48,667
BUT REPUBLICAN FOR THE LAWS 

378
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:51,103
PASSED BY CONGRESS AND REPORT 

379
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,105
IF THE LAW, THE WORDS PUT INTO 

380
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:53,638
THE CONSTITUTION ITSELF. 

381
00:12:53,638 --> 00:12:56,207
THAT'S PART OF BEING A GLAD JOB 

382
00:12:56,207 --> 00:12:59,278
AND PART OF BEING -- GOOD JUDGE 

383
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,779
AND PART OF BEING A GOOD 

384
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:01,079
PRECEDENT. 

385
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:02,848
THERE ARE HUMAN QUALITIES IN 

386
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,850
TERMS OF THE INTERACTION. 

387
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:05,383
ALTHOUGH THE CONFIRMATION 

388
00:13:05,383 --> 00:13:06,485
PROCESSES FOCUS ON ONE PERSON, 

389
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:07,786
AS IF YOU ARE MAKING BAWL THE 

390
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,321
DECISIONS -- ALL THE DECISIONS 

391
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:10,789
AS I SAID YESTERDAY I'M JOINING 

392
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,792
A TEAM OF NINE IF I AM 

393
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,727
FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE 

394
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:15,027
CONFIRMED. 

395
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:15,594
AND THAT MEANS SOMETHING. 

396
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,629
MEANS SOMETHING IN SPORTS AND 

397
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:19,330
IT MEANS SOMETHING IN JUDGING. 

398
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,399
I DON'T MAKE DECISIONS BY 

399
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,534
MYSELF, FOR THE LAST 12 YEARS I 

400
00:13:22,534 --> 00:13:24,969
HAVE NOT BEEN MAKING DECISIONS 

401
00:13:24,969 --> 00:13:25,270
BY MYSELF. 

402
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,139
EVERY CASE HAS BEEN IN A PANEL 

403
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,207
OF AT LEAST THREE JUDGES. 

404
00:13:29,207 --> 00:13:30,842
AND YOU LEARN FROM EACH OTHER. 

405
00:13:30,842 --> 00:13:31,810
WHEN YOU ARE DECIDING DAISES 

406
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,780
AND YOU WORK WITH EACH -- CASES 

407
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,282
AND YOU WORK WITH EACH OWN 

408
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,117
WHERE YOU ARE DECIDING CASES. 

409
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:43,255
>> SO HAVING COLLEGIALITY AND 

410
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:45,157
CIVILITY AS JUSTICE CAN ENDY 

411
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,659
SHOWED -- KENNEDY SHOWED US 

412
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,559
OVER THE YEARS, THAT'S VERY 

413
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:48,460
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE GREAT 

414
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,131
MOMENTS THAT I WAS TALKING 

415
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,333
ABOUT AT THE BEGINNING LIKE 

416
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,970
UNITED STATES VERSUS NIXON AND 

417
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,205
BOARD V. BOARD. 

418
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,940
UNANIMOUS DECISIONS AND THAT 

419
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,273
FORCED TOOK. 

420
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:02,608
THAT TOOK PERSONAL INFORMATION 

421
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:03,008
AND COLLEGIALITY. 

422
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,443
SO I THINK YOU KNOW I HAVE 

423
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:08,180
TRIED TO BE A VERY COLLEGIAL 

424
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:08,413
JUDGE. 

425
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:09,548
I'VE TRIED TO BE CIVIL. 

426
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:12,084
I WANT MR. CHAIRMAN, THE LOSING 

427
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:14,553
PARTY, THE LOSING PARTY, IN 

428
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,822
EVERY CASE TO COME OUT AND SAY 

429
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:20,059
KAVANAUGH GIVE ME A FAIR SHAKE, 

430
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:23,529
HE WAS APRIL WELL PREPARE -- 

431
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:23,995
WELL PREPARED. 

432
00:14:23,995 --> 00:14:26,665
HE WROTE A CLEAR OPINION AND 

433
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:27,466
EXPLAINED EVERYTHING. 

434
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:31,303
I WANT THE LOSING PARTY AND I 

435
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:34,239
WANT BOTH PARTIES TO WALK OUT 

436
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,207
AT ARTICLE ARGUMENT AND SAID -- 

437
00:14:36,207 --> 00:14:38,777
ORAL ARGUMENT AND SAID I HAVE A 

438
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:39,178
PROBLEM. 

439
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,547
EVERYTHING YOU DO A JUDGE 

440
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:46,017
HADDERS IN TERMS OF BEING A 

441
00:14:46,017 --> 00:14:46,384
GOOD ARGUMENT. 

442
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:49,021
THOSE ARE THE QUALITIES I GUESS 

443
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:49,554
THE LAST THING I ALWAYS 

444
00:14:49,554 --> 00:14:50,756
REMEMBER ABOUT IT IS THAT THE 

445
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:55,027
THING I SAID MY MOM TOLD ME 

446
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,295
FROM THE FIRST INSTANCE. 

447
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:59,865
JUDGING IS NOT JUST ABOUT 

448
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:00,098
THEORY. 

449
00:15:00,098 --> 00:15:02,101
IT'S NOT THEORY, IT IS KNOT 

450
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:06,739
JUST WHAT A LAW REVIEW ARTICLE 

451
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:06,905
IS. 

452
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:07,840
JUNEING IS REAL PEOPLE IN THE 

453
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,074
REAL WORLD AND EVERY DECISION 

454
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:13,112

455
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,146
MIGHT SOUND, AFFECTS REAL 

456
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,214

REAL INTERESTS AND WE HAVE TO 

458
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,918
REMEMBER THAT AND HOW WE 

459
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:20,519

558
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,692
I ALWAYS WILL GO BACK TO GREAT 

559
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:50,829
MOMENTS IN OUR HISTORY WHERE 

560
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:51,429
THESE PRINCIPALS WHICH SOUND 

561
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:53,999
ABSTRACT IF YOU ARE JUST 

562
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,534
DESCRIBING THEM WERE ACTUALLY 

563
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:59,304
IMPLEMENTED AND I GO BACK TO 

564
00:18:59,304 --> 00:18:59,705
YOUNGSTOWN STEEL. 

565
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:06,345
AND YOU THINK ABOUT IT'S A 6-3 

566
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:07,746
DECISION RULES THAT PRESIDENT 

567
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:09,481
TRUMAN VIOLATED THE LAW BY 

568
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,182
SEIZING THE STEEL MILLS. 

569
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:15,220
THIS IS A TIME OF WAR, WHERE 

570
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,389
LOTS OF AMERICANS WERE KILLED. 

571
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,224
AND THE SUPREME COURT'S UNDER 

572
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:19,825
PRESSURE TO DEFER TO THE 

573
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,660
PRESIDENT'S WAR EFFORT. 

574
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,063
IN A 6-3 DECISION BUT WHAT'S 

575
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:25,730
INTERESTING TO ME, JUSTICE 

576
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,498
CLARK YOU DON'T YOU CANNILY 

577
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,935
TALK ABOUT CLARK IN IS THAT 

578
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:30,669
DECISION, WHY IS HE IMPORTANT? 

579
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,271
HE'S IMPORTANT, HE WAS 

580
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:35,874
APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT TRUE 

581
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:36,441
MONOTO THE SUPREME COURT. 

582
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:39,477
-- TRUMAN TO THE SUPREME COURT. 

583
00:19:39,477 --> 00:19:40,245
WHAT A MOMENT OF JUDICIALEN

INDEPENDENCE THERE TO RUN IN 

585
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,314
THAT CASE. 

586
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,916
YOU THINK ABOUT JUSTICE JACKSON 

587
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,251
WHO HAD BEEN WORKING FOR 

588
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:48,787
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT AND THEN 

589
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:52,157
DEDESCENDS IN THE CASE, STAND 

590
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:58,964
UP AND SAYS LETTING RACISM LIKE 

591
00:19:58,964 --> 00:19:59,597
THIS IS LIKE LETTING A -- [ 

592
00:19:59,597 --> 00:20:10,842
INAUDIBLE ] JUSTICE JACKSON -- 

593
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,009

>> Reporter: ASK HIM TO

00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,647
SUSPEND. 

596
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:17,281
>> JUSTICE JACKSON'S 

597
00:20:17,281 --> 00:20:18,317
CONCURRENCE IN YOUNGSTOWN WHICH 

598
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,552
IS OF COURSE WHAT HAS BECOME 

599
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:26,558
THE LAW THAT THREE PART TEST 

600
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,592
CATEGORY 1, CATEGORY TWO, 

601
00:20:27,592 --> 00:20:30,295
CATEGORY 3. BUT AGAIN HE WRITES 

602
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:31,430
THAT HE TAD TAKEN POSITIONS 

603
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:37,703
CONTRARY TO THAT ONE WHEN HE 

604
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,171
WORKED IN THE ROOSEVELT 

605
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:39,538
ADMINISTRATION. 

606
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:43,308
HOW ABOUT CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER? 

607
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:46,110
UNITED STATES VERSUS NIXON. 

608
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,212
WRITES THE OPINION. 

609
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:47,512
UNANIMOUS. 

610
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:47,946
MOMENTS OF JUDICIAL 

611
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:51,249
INDEPENDENCE. 

612
00:20:51,249 --> 00:20:52,751
SO IT'S RESISTING PUBLIC 

613
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,786
PRESSURE POLITICAL PRESSURE AND 

614
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,355

618
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,459
WHEN I WAS A -- BECAME A JUDGE 

619
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:05,163

OF BIN LADEN'S ASSOCIATES. 

625
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:59,551
YOU WILL NEVER HAVE A NOMINEE 

626
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:00,885

THIS IS COMING OUT OF MY TIME. 

630
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:04,723
BUT THAT'S OKAY. 

631
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:09,261
LET THESE PEOPLE HAVE THEIR 

632
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,395
FREE SPEECH. 

633
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:11,630

HIS MILITARY COMMISSION 

656
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:53,705
PROSECUTION IS 

657
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:54,105
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

HAMDAN. 

665
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:05,850
WHY DID I DO THAT IN THAT CASE? 

666
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:10,121
WHY DID I RULE FOR SOMEONE WHO 

667
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:11,890
HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN THE 

668
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,691

742
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,801
CIRCUIT ARE AT THE NATIONAL 

743
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:38,703
LEVEL AND THEREFORE INVOLVING 

744
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,239
QUESTIONS OF SEPARATION OF 

745
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,274
POWERS BETWEEN THE LEGISLAIVE 

746
00:25:43,274 --> 00:25:44,276
EXECUTIVE AND JUDICIAL 

747
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:44,542
BRANCHES. 

748
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,011
OF COURSE FEDERALISM IS A 

749
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:47,478
CRITICAL PART OF THE 

750
00:25:47,478 --> 00:25:50,448
CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE AS 

751
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:51,316
WELL. 

752
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:55,020
THE GENIUS OF OUR SYSTEM, 

753
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,221
FEDERALIST 39 IS DESCRIBED BY 

754
00:25:57,221 --> 00:25:59,124
MADISON AS WE HAVE GOAT A 

755
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:03,161
NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND A -- 

756
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:07,332
BOTH A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND 

757
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,334
A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 

758
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:09,701
SIMULTANEOUSLY. 

759
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:10,368
THE HOUSE REPRESENTS THE 

760
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:10,868
NATURAL GAS PROPORTION. 

761
00:26:10,868 --> 00:26:12,971
THIS BODY REPRESENTS IN MANY 

762
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:16,207
WAYS THE FEDERAL PART. 

763
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,143
EACH STATE REPRESENTED EQUALLY. 

764
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:19,444
AND THE FEDERALISM SYSTEM BY 

765
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:21,846
WHICH THE STATES ARE ALLOWED TO 

766
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:25,317
REGULATE LOCAL MATTERS IN SOME 

767
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,152
OF THE COMMERCE CLAUSE CASES 

768
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:29,888
LIKE THE UNITED STATES VERSUS 

769
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,189
LOPEZ AND MORRISON. 

770
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:33,758
REINFORCE THE IDEA THAT THERE'S 

771
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:34,759
A CORE OF AUTHORITY THAT IS 

772
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,362
EXCLUSIVELY IN THE PROVINCE OF 

773
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,931
THE STATES AND BEYOND THE SCOPE 

774
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:47,305
OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

777
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:51,309
>> THAT'S IN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL 

778
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:53,678
SYSTEM. 

779
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:54,779
IT'S IMPORTANT ALWAYS TO 

780
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,581
REMEMBER THE ROLE OF THE STATES 

781
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:58,016
IN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEMS 

782
00:26:58,016 --> 00:26:59,818
AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE 

783
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:00,752
AS INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS 

784
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:02,153
SOMETHING WE OFTEN FORGET. 

785
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:04,823
PARTICULARLY IN A PROCESS LIKE 

786
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:05,023
THIS. 

787
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:05,724
OUR RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES ARE 

788
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:06,558
PROTECTED -- LIBERTIES ARE 

789
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:08,326
PROTECTED BY THE FEDERAL 

790
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:10,328
CONSTITUTION AND BY THE FEDERAL 

791
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:11,329
COURTS BUT THEY'RE ALSO 

792
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:13,965
PROTECTED BY STATE 

793
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,199
CONSTITUTIONS AND STATE COURTS. 

794
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:16,501
SO GREAT JUDGE ON THE SIXTH 

795
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:18,803
COURT HAS WRITTEN A NEW BOOK 

796
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:19,737
ABOUT USING STATE CONSTITUTIONS 

797
00:27:19,737 --> 00:27:23,942
TO HELP PROTECT YOUR INDIVIDUAL 

798
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:24,475
LIBERTIES AND RIGHTS TOO. 

799
00:27:24,475 --> 00:27:26,277
THIS WHOLE DOCUMENT THROUGH THE 

800
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:29,280
SEPARATION OF POWERS AND THE 

801
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,449
FEDERALISM TILTS TOWARD 

802
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:34,252
LIBERTY. 

803
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:36,087
TILTS THE TOWARDS LIBERTY. 

804
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:37,188
-- TILTS TOWARDS LIBERTY. 

805
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:39,057
>> ALSO THE QUESTION OF 

806
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:57,776
INDEPENDENCE FROM 

807
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:05,517
, BECAUSE YOU'LL

808
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,152
PREDICT HOW CASES WILL BE RULED

809
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:07,452
BEFORE YOU.

810
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:09,521
MAYBE THEY WOULD VOTE TO CONFIRM

811
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:09,754
YOU.

812
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:12,824
IF NOT THAT I MIGHT NOT.

813
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:14,358
OF COURSE THAT'S IMPROPER.

814
00:28:14,358 --> 00:28:17,695
JUDGES SHOULD NEVER PROMISE

815
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,130
THEIR FUTURE VOTES ON THE

816
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,032
EXCHANGE FOR A SENATOR'S VOTE

817
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:21,332
FOR THEM.

818
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:23,568
IF YOU ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS

819
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:26,104
ABOUT YOUR VIEWS ON SPECIFIC

820
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:27,038
SUPREME COURT CASES, OR PUBLIC

821
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,139
CONTROVERSIES OF THE DAY YOU'D

822
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:31,409
BE SHOWING THE OPPOSITE OF

823
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:32,343
INDEPENDENCE FROM THE

824
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:33,077
LEGISLATIVE BRANCH, POLITICIANS

825
00:28:33,077 --> 00:28:38,016
CAN MAKE PROMISES ABOUT HOW

826
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,216
THEY'LL VOTE ON ISSUES, JUDGES

827
00:28:39,216 --> 00:28:42,086
BY THE VERY NATURE OF THE JOB

828
00:28:42,086 --> 00:28:43,121
SHOULD NEVER PROMISE ANY

829
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:43,354
OUTCOME.

830
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:46,257
IF A NOMINEE ANSWERS THESE

831
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:47,225
QUESTIONS IT THREATENS THE

832
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,225
UNDERMINE JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE.

833
00:28:48,225 --> 00:28:51,329
OF COURSE THERE MAY BE TIMES

834
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:56,267
WHERE IT'S APPROPRIATE TO

835
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:56,934
RECONSIDER CERTAIN DECISIONS,

836
00:28:56,934 --> 00:28:59,304
ESPECIALLY IF MORE RECENT

837
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:02,106
OPINIONS HAVE CALLED INTO

838
00:29:02,106 --> 00:29:03,141
QUESTION THE RATIONALE OF

839
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:03,408
DECISIONS.

840
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,376
SO WITH THIS IN MIND I'D LIKE TO

841
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:07,111
EXPLORE THE APPROACH THAT YOU

842
00:29:07,111 --> 00:29:08,213
TAKE TOWARDS SUPREME COURT

843
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:08,480
PRESIDENT.

844
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,516
COULD YOU TELL US YOUR VIEWS ON

845
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:12,450
THE VALUE OF PRECEDENT?

846
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,484
I THINK YOU'VE ALREADY DONE

847
00:29:13,484 --> 00:29:16,221
THAT, BUT IF YOU WANT TO EXPAND

848
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,423
ON IT GO AHEAD.

849
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,291
HAVE YOU EVER FOLLOWED PRESIDENT

850
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:24,462
OF THE SUPREME COURT WHEN DOING

851
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:25,262
SO CONFLICTED WITH YOUR PERSONAL

852
00:29:25,262 --> 00:29:25,529
BELIEFS?

853
00:29:25,596 --> 00:29:31,503
>> MY PERSONAL BELIEFS ARE NOT

854
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,137
RELEVANT IN HOW I DECIDE CASES.

855
00:29:33,137 --> 00:29:35,306
ROOTED IN ARTICLE 3 OF THE

856
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:37,642
CONSTITUTION, IT'S NOT JUST A

857
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:38,009
JUDICIAL POLICY.

858
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:42,046
THE ROLE OF PRECEDENCE TO ENSURE

859
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:46,151
STABILITY IN THE LAW, WHICH IS

860
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:46,651
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT --

861
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:47,351
[ CROWD YELLING ]

862
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,654
>> -- AND ALSO TO ENSURE PREDICT

863
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:52,056
ABILITY, PEOPLE WHO ORDER THEIR

864
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:53,424
AFFAIRS AROUND JUDICIAL

865
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:54,726
DECISIONS NEED TO KNOW THE LAW

866
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,060
IS PREDICTABLE WHETHER YOU'RE AN

867
00:29:56,060 --> 00:30:00,231
INDIVIDUAL OR BUSINESS OR

868
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:01,599
WORKER, YOU NEED TO HAVE

869
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:02,333
PREDICTABILITY.

870
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:05,303
PEOPLE RELY ON THE DECISIONS OF

871
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,306
THE COURTS SO RELIANCE INTERESTS

872
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,774
ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO

873
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:10,808
CONSIDER AS A MATTER OF

874
00:30:10,808 --> 00:30:11,075
PRECEDENT.

875
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:13,044
THEY ARE ONE OF THE REASONS WE

876
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:15,313
HAVE THE SYSTEM OF PRECEDENCE SO

877
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:18,883
PEOPLE CAN RELY ON THE

878
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:19,150
DECISIONS.

879
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:19,750
PRECEDENT ALSO REINFORCES THE

880
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,985
IMPARTIAL AT AND INDEPENDENCE OF

881
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:21,819
THE JUDI GUESSARY.

882
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:25,423
THE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW IN THIS

883
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:27,058
COUNTRY THAT THE JUDGES ARE

884
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:29,527
INDEPENDENT AND WE'RE NOT MAKING

885
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:30,695
DECISIONS BASED ON POLICY VIEWS.

886
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:33,865
PART OF THAT IS TO UNDERSTAND

887
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,333
WE'RE FOLLOWING A SYSTEM OF

888
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,869
PRECEDENT, OF WHAT HAS BEEN DONE

889
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:38,102
BEFORE.

890
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:39,737
THE COURT, EVERY TIME SOMEONE

891
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:41,306
GETS ON, IT'S NOT JUST BOUNCING

892
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:43,608
AROUND TO WHAT DO I THINK'S

893
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:43,808
BEST.

894
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:45,677
IT'S WHAT'S THE PRECEDENT OF THE

895
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,746
SUPREME COURT, IS ALWAYS PART OF

896
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:52,083
THE ANALYSIS, AN IMPORTANT PART

897
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:53,284
AND FOR 12 YEARS, I'VE BEEN

898
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:55,220
APPLYING PRECEDENT OF THE

899
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,055
SUPREME COURT AND OF MY COURT.

900
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:58,723
EVERY DAY FOR 12 YEARS, I

901
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:01,526
HAVEN'T BEEN GETTING UP SAYING,

902
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,061
HOW CAN I REWRITE THE LAW.

903
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:04,929
I'VE BEEN GETTING UP FOR

904
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:11,569
12 YEARS EVERY DAY SAYING HOW I

905
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:15,139
CAN APPLY THIS FOURTH MEND MEANT

907
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:18,209
OR THIRD AMENDMENT TO THIS

908

PRECEDENT.

909
00:31:18,609 --> 00:31:21,079
SO IT'S THE FOUNDATION OF OUR

910
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,214
SYSTEM, IT'S PART OF THE

911
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,782
STABILITY, IT'S ENSURING

912
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:27,251
PREDICTABILITY AND IT'S JUST

913
00:31:27,251 --> 00:31:29,988
FOUNDATIONAL TO THE

914
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:33,891
CONSTITUTION, AS ARTICLE III IN

915
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:34,291

[ CROWD YELLING ]

917

MEMBERS WHAT SUPREME COURT

919
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:40,965
PRESIDENT YOU LIKE AND DON'T

920
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:44,435
LIKE, BUT AS YOU KNOW, IT'S

921
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:47,372
INAPPROPRIATE FOR A NOMINEE TO

922
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:50,541
ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS AND THIS

923
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:51,241
REFERS TO JUDGE GINSBURG.

924
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:55,980
HE SAID QUOTE A JUDGE SWORN TO

925
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,216
DECIDE IMPARTIALALITY CAN OFFER

926
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:01,019
NO FORECAST, NO HENCE FOR THAT

927
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,287
WOULD SHOW NOT ONLY DISREGARD

928
00:32:03,287 --> 00:32:10,695
FOR THE SPECIFICS OF A

929
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:11,228
PARTICULAR CASE, IT WOULD

930
00:32:11,228 --> 00:32:16,234
DISPLAY DESTAIN FOR THE

931
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:16,634
UNDERLYING QUOTE.

932
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:20,305
GIVING HENCE UNDERMINES THE VERY

933
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:21,239
INDEPENDENCE WE DISCUSSED.

934
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:23,240
WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT?

935
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:27,845
>> I DO, SENATOR, MR. CHAIRMAN,

936
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:30,181
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

937
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:32,450
HAVE TO REMEMBER SITTING IN THIS

938
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,219
SEAT IS THAT THIS MOMENT IS A

939
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:38,322
MOMENT OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE

940
00:32:38,322 --> 00:32:40,024
WITH HOW I INTERACT WITH THIS

941
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:40,291
COMMITTEE.

942
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,061
AND WHAT I'VE DONE IN EACH OF

943
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:45,463
THE JOBS I'VE THIS, PARTICULARLT

944
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,298
12 YEARS BUT ALSO IN THE

945
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,100
EXECUTIVE BRANCH, YOU ALWAYS

946
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,334
ASK -- I ALWAYS ASK MYSELF --

947
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:52,904
AND I TELL PEOPLE I WORKING WITH

948
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:54,906
ASK, HOW HAS IT BEEN DONE

949
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:55,306
BEFORE?

950
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,108
HOW HAS IT BEEN DONE BEFORE?

951
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:59,877
SO AS A JUDGE HOW HAS IT BEEN

952
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:00,477
DIFFER BEFORE IS PRECEDENT.

953
00:33:00,477 --> 00:33:03,047
WHEN I'M SITTING HERE WHAT DID I

954
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:03,314
DO?

955
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:06,350
I STUDIED ALL THE NOMINEE

956
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:06,751
PRECEDENT.

957
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,119
I'VE STUDIED, READ THURGOOD

958
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:08,753
MARSHALL'S HEARING AND JUSTICE

959
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,088
BRENNAN'S HEARINGS AND THE

960
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:11,322
HEARINGS OF THE EIGHT JUSTICES

961
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,325
CURRENTLY SITTING ON THE SUPREME

962
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:14,525
COURT.

963
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:15,793
IT'S WHAT I CALL NOMINEE

964
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:16,060
PRECEDENT.

965
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,795
AND SO ALL THE NOMINEES

966
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,197
CURRENTLY SITTING ON THE SUPREME

967
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:22,600
COURT, ALL THE JUSTICES HAVE

968
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,468
MADE CLEAR A COUPLE THINGS,

969
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:25,103
FIRST OF ALL THEY CAN'T DISCUSS

970
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:28,806
CASES OR ISSUES THAT MAY COME

971
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:29,106
BEFORE THEM.

972
00:33:29,106 --> 00:33:31,309
AS JUSTICE GINSBURG SAID NO

973
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,043
HINTS, NO FORECASTS, NO

974
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:32,310
PREVIEWS.

975
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,778
THAT ALSO MEANS WITH RESPECT TO

976
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:36,347
AT LEAST THE VAST BODY OF

977
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,982
SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT GOING

978
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:39,217
BACK, YOU CAN'T GIVE A THUMB'S

979
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:49,426
UP OR THUMB'S DOWN ON THE CASE.

980
00:33:49,426 --> 00:33:50,594
THAT'S JUSTICE KEAGEN'S

981
00:33:50,594 --> 00:33:53,998
FORMULATION.

982
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:56,634
I LIKED HER FORMULATION THERE,

983
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:59,303
NO THUMB'S UP, OR NO THUMB'S

984
00:33:59,303 --> 00:33:59,637
DOWN.

985
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:00,738
THAT NOMINEE PRECEDENT IS PART

986
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:01,939
OF THE INDEPENDENT OF THE

987
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:02,840
JUDICIARY AND THAT NOMINEE

988
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,108
PRECEDENT IS SOMETHING I NEED TO

989
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:06,677
ADHERE TO WHEN I AM HERE AS A

990
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:09,547
NOMINEE NOW, BECAUSE THAT'S ONE

991
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,482
OF MY JOBS HERE IS NOT TO

992
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:14,252
ADVANCE MY OWN INTEREST, BUT

993
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:14,885
REMEMBER I'M A REPRESENTATIVE OF

994
00:34:14,885 --> 00:34:16,987
THE JUDICIARY AS A WHOLE AND I

995
00:34:16,987 --> 00:34:18,322
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO DO

996
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:19,857
JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE RIGHT

997
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:22,527
HERE, RIGHT NOW, AS A NOMINEE.

998
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:23,427
SO FOLLOWING THAT NOMINEE

999
00:34:23,427 --> 00:34:24,661
PRECEDENT'S GOING TO BE

1000
00:34:24,661 --> 00:34:24,929
CRITICAL.

1001
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:26,931
NOW THERE IS AN EXCEPTION THAT

1002
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:27,899
EIGHT JUSTICES HAVE DRAWN

1003
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:28,632
CURRENTLY SITTING ON THE COURT,

1004
00:34:28,632 --> 00:34:36,340
IF YOU READ AT ALL HEARINGS FOR

1005
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,076
SOME OLDER CASES, AND I'LL BE

1006
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,344
HAPPY FOR SOME OLDER CASES WHERE

1007
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:42,612
THE NOMINEE HAS ALLOWED THE

1008
00:34:42,612 --> 00:34:44,282
JUSTICES TO TALK ABOUT A FEW

1009
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:45,416
OLDER CASES.

1010
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,284
AND AGAIN WHY DO WE DO THIS?

1011
00:34:47,284 --> 00:34:48,886
WHY IS THIS NOMINEE PRECEDENT

1012
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:50,788
THERE WHEN EIGHT JUSTICES OF

1013
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:54,391
WIDELY RAGING VIEWS DO THIS?

1014
00:34:54,391 --> 00:34:55,525
THERE MUST BE A REASON.

1015
00:34:55,525 --> 00:34:57,595
THE REASON IS JUDICIAL

1016
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:57,928
INDEPENDENCE.

1017
00:34:57,928 --> 00:34:58,362
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

1018
00:34:58,362 --> 00:34:59,897
THE LITIGANTS WHO COME BEFORE US

1019
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:02,099
HAVE TO KNOW WE HAVE AN OPEN

1020
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:04,569
MIND, THAT WE DON'T HAVE A

1021
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:05,369
CLOSED MIND, THAT WE HAVEN'T

1022
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:08,406
COMMITTED SOMETHING IN THIS

1023
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:10,942
PROCESS THAT IS GOING TO E FACT

1024
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,110
HOW WE DECIDE A CASE BECAUSE WE

1025
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:16,013
FEEL BOUND BY WHAT WE PROMISE TO

1026
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:16,380
THIS COMMITTEE.

1027
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,949
AND JUDGES FEEL BOUND LIE WHAT

1028
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,517
THEY SAID TO THIS COMMITTEE SO

1029
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:21,185
IF I SAID SOMETHING AND THE CASE

1030
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:22,820
COMES BEFORE ME FIVE YEARS FROM

1031
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,188
NOW, I'M GOING TO FEEL MORALLY

1032
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:26,057
BOUND BY WHAT I SAID HERE AND IF

1033
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,358
I'VE CROSSED THE LINE OF WHAT I

1034
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:28,426
SHOULD SAY, THEN I'M IN THE

1035
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:32,396
GOING TO HAVE AN OPEN MIND IN

1036
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:32,663
THAT CASE.

1037
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:34,999
THAT'S A VIOLATION OF JUDICIAL

1038
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:35,332
INDEPENDENCE.

1039
00:35:35,332 --> 00:35:36,601
SECONDLY, AS CHIEF JUSTICE

1040
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:38,703
ROBERTS DESCRIBED PARENS BETTER

1041
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,071
THAN ANYONE, IF I GET INTO SOME

1042
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,839
KIND OF PROCESS THAT APPEARS TO

1043
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,441
BE A BARGAINING PROCESS WHERE I

1044
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:44,842
SAY, I'LL AGREE WITH THIS

1045
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:47,645
DECISION IN EXCHANGE FOR YOUR

1046
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,046
VOTE, IT'S NEVER THAT EXPLICIT,

1047
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:51,883
BUT AS CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS

1048
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:52,516
DESCRIBED IT, THAT'S KIND OF

1049
00:35:52,516 --> 00:35:56,454
THE -- WHAT SEEMS TO BE GOING ON

1050
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:59,323
SOMETIMES.

1051
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:03,261
THAT'S A COMPLETE VIOLATION OF

1052
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:03,728
JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE.

1053
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:04,695
THE JUDGES AREN'T MAKING THEIR

1054
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:07,398
DECISION ON THE LAW, IT'S AS

1055
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:09,834
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS DESCRIBED

1056
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,603
IT, IT'S THE SENATE OR JUDICIARY

1057
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:16,374
COMMITTEE SENDING A NOMINEE TO

1058
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,976
THE DELEGATE OF THE JUDICIARY

1059
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:20,744
AND DOING WHAT THE JUDICIARY

1060
00:36:20,744 --> 00:36:21,912
COMMITTEE SEEMS TO DO.

1061
00:36:21,912 --> 00:36:25,283
DOING THAT WOULD BE A VIOLATION

1062
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:25,916
OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE.

1063
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:26,883
THAT NOMINEE PRECEDENT WEIGHS

1064
00:36:26,883 --> 00:36:31,022
HEAVILY ON ME AS A NOMINEE HERE

1065
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:39,497
BECAUSE IT'S ROOTED IN JUDICIAL

1066
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:39,830
INDEPENDENCE.

1067
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,600
I HAVE TO ADHERE TO THE LINES

1068
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,001
DRAWN BY THOSE OF PRIOR

1069
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,303
NOMINEES, MR. CHAIRMAN.

1070
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:48,773
>> WITH ONLY 25 SECONDS LEFT I'M

1071
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:50,441
GOING TO RESERVE THAT TIME AND

1072
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:51,475
GO TO SENATOR FEINSTEIN.

1073
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:53,944
>> THAT YOU HAVE, MR. CHAIRMAN.

1074
00:36:53,944 --> 00:36:54,411
GOOD MORNING, JUDGE.

1075
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:55,379
>> THANK YOU.

1076
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,783
>> I'M SORRY ABOUT THE

1077
00:36:58,783 --> 00:36:59,450
CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT WE'LL GET

1078
00:36:59,450 --> 00:36:59,750
THROUGH IT.

1079
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,453
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU THIS

1080
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:06,290
MORNING ABOUT GUNS AND GO BACK

1081
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,659
TO ROE V. WADE IF I MIGHT.

1082
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:12,763
MY OFFICE WROTE THE ASSAULT

1083
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:14,465
WEAPONS LEGISLATION IN 1993.

1084
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:23,474
IT WAS LAW FROM '94 TO 2004, AND

1085
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:24,542
ESSENTIALLY PROHIBITED THE

1086
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:26,910
TRANSFER, SALE, AND MANUFACTURER

1087
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,044
OF ASSAULT WEAPONS.

1088
00:37:28,044 --> 00:37:31,449
IT DID NOT, AT THE TIME, AFFECT

1089
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:31,749
POSSESSION.

1090
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,985
I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE THAT IT DID

1091
00:37:34,985 --> 00:37:37,588
WORK AND THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT

1092
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,091
AND I HAVE WATCHED CASE, AFTER

1093
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,293
CASE, AND I THINK I MENTIONED

1094
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:43,361
EARLIER SCHOOL SHOOTINGS, WHICH

1095
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:46,831
ARE JUST -- I NEVER THOUGHT THIS

1096
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:49,466
WOULD HAPPEN IN OUR COUNTRY,

1097
00:37:49,466 --> 00:37:52,136
THAT SOMEONE WOULD BRING A SEMI

1098
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:55,005
AUTOMATIC ASSAULT WEAPON INTO A

1099
00:37:55,005 --> 00:37:59,677
SCHOOL AND JUST MOW DOWN

1100
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:00,110
CHILDREN AND STAFF.

1101
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:06,417
AND SO I'VE BEEN VERY INTERESTED

1102
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:09,487
IN YOUR THINKING ON ASSAULT

1103
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:09,720
WEAPONS.

1104
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,188
YOU SPECIFICALLY ARGUED THAT

1105
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:12,256
D.C. ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN WAS

1106
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:14,458
UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND I THINK

1107
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,960
BECAUSE YOU SAID THESE WEAPONS

1108
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,330
WERE IN COMMON USE.

1109
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,399
WHAT DID I BASE YOUR CONCLUSION

1110
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:22,666
THAT ASSAULT WEAPONS FOR COMMON

1111
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:27,038
USE AND WHAT EVIDENCE OR STUDY

1112
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:28,472
DID YOU USE DO THAT?

1113
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:31,508
THANK YOU SENATOR FEINSTEIN FOR

1114
00:38:31,508 --> 00:38:35,246
THE QUESTION AND I UNDERSTAND OF

1115
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:36,847
COURSE YOUR ROLE ON THAT ISSUE

1116
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:41,252
AND YOUR LONG LEADERSHIP ON THAT

1117
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,120
ISSUE AND APPRECIATE THAT.

1118
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,455
I FACED A DECISION WHEREAS IN

1119
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:46,123
EVERY OTHER DECISION JUST ABOUT

1120
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:50,261
ON THE D.C. CIRCUIT I HAD TO

1121
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:50,661
FOLLOW PRECEDENT.

1122
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:51,996
PREEDENT OF THE SUPREME COURT.

1123
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,231
I DON'T GET TO PICK AND CHOOSE

1124
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:57,334
WHICH SUPREME COURT PRECEDENCE I

1125
00:38:57,334 --> 00:38:57,801
GET TO FOLLOW.

1126
00:38:57,801 --> 00:38:59,103
I FOLLOW THEM ALL.

1127
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:01,504
AND SO IN THE SECOND AMENDMENT

1128
00:39:01,504 --> 00:39:07,578
IN CONTEXT, THE SUPREME COURT IN

1129
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:08,378
THE HELLER DECISION WRITTEN BY

1130
00:39:08,378 --> 00:39:09,613
JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA HELD

1131
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:11,949
THERE WAS AN INDIVIDUAL TO KEEP

1132
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:16,220
AND RIGHT AND BEAR ARMS AND THEN

1133
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,488
IN EXPLAINING WHAT THAT MEANT

1134
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:24,028
AND WHAT EXCEPTIONS WOULD BE

1135
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,396
ALLOWED TO THAT RIGHT, JUSTICE

1136
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:26,330
ANTONIN SCALIA'S OPINION OF THE

1137
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,331
REPORT IN PART THREE WENT

1138
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:32,002
THROUGH THIS DOES NOT MEAN THERE

1139
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:33,104
IS NO GUN REGULATION

1140
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,205
PERMISSIBLE, SO THAT WAS AN

1141
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,906
IMPORTANT PART, PART THREE OF

1142
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:37,675
THE SUPREME COURT'S OPINION

1143
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:41,011
WHERE IT PREIDENTIFIED A NUMBER

1144
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:45,316
OF EXCEPTIONS THAT WOULD BE

1145
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:45,549
ALLOWED.

1146
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,383
FELON IN POSSESSION LAWS,

1147
00:39:46,383 --> 00:39:47,952
CONCEALED CARRY, LAWS POSSESSION

1148
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:50,121
OF THE MENTALLY ILL.

1149
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:53,324
POSSESSION OF GUNS IN SCHOOLS.

1150
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:56,961
POSSESSION IN CERTAIN KINDS OF

1151
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:57,228
BUILDINGS.

1152
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:57,862
HE PREIDENTIFIED THAT.

1153
00:39:57,862 --> 00:40:00,064
AS TO THE WEAPONS, THE WAY I

1154
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,265
UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE SAID THERE

1155
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:04,802
AND WHAT WAS SAID IN THE

1156
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:07,671
McDONALD CASE LATER WAS THAT

1157
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:08,873
DANGEROUS AND UNUSUAL WEAPONS

1158
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:11,308
COULD BE PROHIBITED AND WHAT HE

1159
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:12,876
REFERRED TO SPECIFICALLY IS

1160
00:40:12,876 --> 00:40:14,912
MACHINE GUNS COULD BE PROHIBITED

1161
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:20,417
SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO

1162
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:21,919
RECOGNIZE UNDER THE HELLER

1163
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:22,887
DECISION MACHINE GUNS CAN BE

1164
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:23,220
PROHIBITED.

1165
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:25,256
>> THEY WERE IN THE FIREARMS ACT

1166
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:25,989
A LONG TIME AGO.

1167
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:27,858
>> YES, AND THAT'S --

1168
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:29,626
>> AND HAVE BEEN PROHIBITED.

1169
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:36,066
>> YES, SENATOR, AND JUSTICE

1170
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:39,103
ANTONIN SCALIA'S OPINION

1171
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,704
REAFFIRMED THAT MACHINE GUNS

1172
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,305
COULD BE PROHIBITED.

1173
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:45,743
THE SUPREME COURT UPHELD -- OR

1174
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,311
STRUCK DOWN A D.C. BAN ON

1175
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:49,647
HANDGUNS, MOST OF WHICH ARE SEMI

1176
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:49,947
AUTOMATIC.

1177
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:52,049
>> LET ME INTERRUPT YOU BECAUSE

1178
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:54,885
I THINK WE'RE ON TOTALLY

1179
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:56,019
DIFFERENT WAVE LENGTHS.

1180
00:40:56,019 --> 00:40:59,557
I'M TALKING ABOUT YOUR STATEMENT

1181
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:02,660
ON COMMON USE, AS COMMON USE

1182
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:05,963
BEING A JUSTIFICATION, AND

1183
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,031
ASSAULT WEAPONS ARE NOT IN

1184
00:41:08,031 --> 00:41:09,633
COMMON USE.

1185
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,067
>> IN JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA'S

1186
00:41:11,067 --> 00:41:13,871
OPINION USED THAT PHRASE AND THE

1187
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,839
NEXT SENTENCE TALKED ABOUT

1188
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,343
DANGEROUS AND UNUSUAL WEAPONS

1189
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:22,279
AND THE COURT IN HELLER ITSELF,

1190
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:26,317
THE SUPREME COURT, STRUCK DOWN A

1191
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,718
D.C. BAN ON HANDGUNS.

1192
00:41:28,718 --> 00:41:31,722
NOW MOST HANDGUNS SEMI

1193
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:32,022
AUTOMATIC.

1194
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:33,524
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING EVERY

1195
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:34,625
APPRECIATES, MOST HANDGUNS ARE

1196
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:34,992
SEMI AUTOMATIC.

1197
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:35,893
AND THE QUESTION CAME BEFORE US

1198
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:39,330
OF SEMI AUTOMATIC RIFLES AND THE

1199
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,431
QUESTION WAS, CAN YOU

1200
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:41,398
DISTINGUISH AS A MATTER OF

1201
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:43,934
PRECEDENT -- THIS IS ALL ABOUT

1202
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:44,334
PRECEDENT FOR ME.

1203
00:41:44,334 --> 00:41:45,069
I'M TRYING TO READ EXACTLY WHAT

1204
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:47,538
THE SUPREME COURT SAID AND IF

1205
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:54,011
YOU READ THE McDONALD CASE, AND

1206
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,279
I CONCLUDED IT COULD NOT BE

1207
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:58,649
DISTINGUISHED AS A MATTER OF LAW

1208
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,284
FROM SEMI AUTOMATIC HANDGUNS AND

1209
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:02,419
SEMI AUTOMATIC RIFLES ARE WIDELY

1210
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:05,956
POSSESS WIDELY

1211
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:08,425
POSSESSED IN THE UNITED STATES.

1212
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:09,859
THERE ARE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS

1213
00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:10,828
AND MILLIONS OF SEMI AUTOMATIC

1214
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:12,029
RIFLES SO THAT SEEMED TO FIT

1215
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,365
COMMON USE AND NOT BEING A

1216
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,332
DANGEROUS AND UNUSUAL WEAPON.

1217
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:20,571
THAT'S -- THAT WAS THE BASIS OF

1218
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:21,005
MY DESCENT.

1219
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:25,242
IN A NUTSHELL, I WAS TRYING TO

1220
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:26,343
FOLLOW STRICTLY AND CAREFULLY,

1221
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:28,646
THE SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT.

1222
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:31,315
>> YOU'RE SAYING NUMBERS

1223
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:33,017
DETERMINE COMMON USE?

1224
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:35,319
COMMON USE IS AN ACTIVITY.

1225
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:36,787
IT'S NOT COMMON STORAGE OR

1226
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:37,087
POSSESSION.

1227
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:37,354
IT'S USE.

1228
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:44,294
SO WHAT YOU SAID WAS THAT THESE

1229
00:42:44,294 --> 00:42:44,995
WEAPONS ARE COMMONLY USED.

1230
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:45,328
THEY'RE NOT.

1231
00:42:45,395 --> 00:42:47,231
>> THEY'RE WIDELY POSSESSED IN

1232
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,866
THE UNITED STATES, SENATOR, AND

1233
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:51,101
THEY ARE -- THEY ARE USED AND

1234
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:54,438
POSSESSED BUT THE QUESTION IS,

1235
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:55,906
ARE THEY A DANGEROUS AND

1236
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,876
UNUSUAL -- CERTAINLY ALL WEAPONS

1237
00:42:58,876 --> 00:42:59,542
ARE DANGEROUS.

1238
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:02,313
ARE THEY UNUSUAL AND GIVEN HOW

1239
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:07,084
PREVENT ALENT THEY ARE IN THE

1240
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:07,451
UNITED

1241
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:12,055
STATES, IF YOU LOOK AT THE

1242
00:43:12,055 --> 00:43:16,260
MAJORITY OF OPINION IN McDONALD,

1243
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,228
I WANT TO REITERATE MACHINE GUNS

1244
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:19,062
CAN BE BANNED.

1245
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:21,198
>> I'M TALKING ABOUT THE HELLER

1246
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:24,968
CASE, LET ME BE SPECIFIC, AND

1247
00:43:24,968 --> 00:43:26,737
YOU SPECIFICALLY ARGUED THAT IT

1248
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:29,573
WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL TO DEFEND

1249
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:30,441
ASSAULT WEAPONS BECAUSE THEY

1250
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,409
ARE -- TO BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS

1251
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:36,146
BECAUSE THEY ARE IN COMMON USE.

1252
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:37,114
AND THAT I BELIEVE WAS YOUR

1253
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,615
DESCENT IN THE CASE.

1254
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:41,385
>> YES, AND I WAS REFERRING TO

1255
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:44,421
SOME SEMI -- SOME KINDS OF SEMI

1256
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:47,424
AUTOMATIC RIFLES THAT ARE BANNED

1257
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:50,460
BY D.C., OR IN WIDELY OWNED IN

1258
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:51,361
THE UNITED STATES.

1259
00:43:51,361 --> 00:43:55,332
AND THAT SEEMED TO BE THE TEST

1260
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:57,968
THAT SUPREME COURT HAD SET FORTH

1261
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,203
IN THE HELLER AND McDONALD

1262
00:43:59,203 --> 00:43:59,403
CASES.

1263
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:04,141
IF A TYPE OF FIREARM IS WIDELY

1264
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,408
USED IN THE UNITED STATES.

1265
00:44:05,408 --> 00:44:07,144
IF I AGREE WITH THAT TEST WAS

1266
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:07,544
NOT THE ISSUE.

1267
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:09,379
I HAVE TO FOLLOW THE PRECEDENT

1268
00:44:09,379 --> 00:44:10,480
OF THE SUPREME COURT AS WRITTEN

1269
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,584
AND THAT'S WHAT I TRIED TO DO IN

1270
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:13,951
THAT CASE.

1271
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,818
IT'S A VERY LONG OPINION.

1272
00:44:15,818 --> 00:44:16,654
I ALSO MADE CLEAR SENATOR

1273
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:20,124
FEINSTEIN AT THE END OF THE

1274
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:25,295
OPINION, I AM A NATIVE OF THIS

1275
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:27,564
AREA, A NATIVE OF AN

1276
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:30,267
URBAN-SUBURBAN AREA IN A CITY

1277
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:32,503
PLAGUED BY GUN, GANG, AND DRUG

1278
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,737
VIOLENCE SO I FULLY UNDERSTAND

1279
00:44:33,737 --> 00:44:35,539
AS I EXPLAIN IN THE OPINION THE

1280
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:38,375
IMPORTANCE OF THIS ISSUE AND I

1281
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,310
SPECIFICALLY REFERENCED THAT

1282
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:41,512
POLICE CHIEF KATHY LANEAR'S

1283
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,947
ROLES OF REDUCING GUN VIOLENCE

1284
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:44,614
WAS SOMETHING I CERTAINLY

1285
00:44:44,614 --> 00:44:47,217
APPLAUDED, BUT THAT I HAD TO

1286
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:49,620
FOLLOW THE PRESENT SENT OF THE

1287
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,522
SUPREME COURT AND AS I SAID READ

1288
00:44:52,522 --> 00:44:53,390
IT THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

1289
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:53,690
I'M SORRY.

1290
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:55,092
>> HOW DO YOU RECONCILE WITH

1291
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:57,895
WHAT YOU JUST SAID WITH THE

1292
00:44:57,895 --> 00:44:59,263
HUNDREDS OF SCHOOL SHOOTINGS

1293
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,565
USING ASSAULT WEAPONS THAT HAVE

1294
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:04,301
TAKEN PLACE IN RECENT HISTORY?

1295
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:05,235
HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THAT?

1296
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:08,338
>> SENATOR, OF COURSE THE

1297
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:09,273
VIOLENCE IN THE SCHOOLS IS

1298
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:11,208
SOMETHING WE ALL DETEST AND WANT

1299
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,343
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT AND THERE

1300
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:17,214
ARE LOTS OF EFFORTS I KNOW

1301
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,549
UNDERWAY TO MAKE SCHOOLS SAFER.

1302
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,883
I KNOW MY GIRL'S SCHOOL THEY DO

1303
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,485
A LOT OF THINGS NOW THAT ARE

1304
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:23,320
DIFFERENT THAN THEY DID A FEW

1305
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,756
YEARS AGO IN EARLY ITS OF TRYING

1306
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:31,328
TO HARDEN THE SCHOOL AND MAKE IT

1307
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:32,795
SAFER FOR EVERYONE.

1308
00:45:32,795 --> 00:45:34,798
GUNS -- HANDGUNS AND SEMI

1309
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:36,533
AUTOMATIC RIFLES ARE WEAPONS

1310
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:38,468
USED FOR HUNTING AND

1311
00:45:38,468 --> 00:45:39,703
SELF-DEFENSE BUT AS YOU SAY,

1312
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:40,437
SENATOR, YOU RIGHTLY SAY,

1313
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:42,239
THEY'RE USED IN A LOT OF

1314
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,108
VIOLENCE CRIME AND CAUSE A LOT

1315
00:45:45,108 --> 00:45:46,510
OF DEATHS.

1316
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,846
HAND GUNS ARE USED IN LOTS OF

1317
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:54,351
CRIMES THAT RESULT IN DEATH AND

1318
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:55,519
SO ARE SEMI AUTOMATIC RIFLES.

1319
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:56,420
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFICULT

1320
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:01,491
AS I SAID IN THE LAST TWO PAGES

1321
00:46:01,491 --> 00:46:04,928
OF MY DESCENT IN HELLER, I

1322
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,997
UNDERSTAND THE DRUG, GANG

1323
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:08,331
VIOLENCE THAT HAS PLAGUED CITIES

1324
00:46:08,331 --> 00:46:09,600
INCLUDING WASHINGTON, D.C.

1325
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,534
THIS WAS KNOWN AS THE MURDER

1326
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:13,136
CAPITAL OF THE WORLD FOR A

1327
00:46:13,136 --> 00:46:15,005
WHILE, THIS CITY, AND THAT WAS A

1328
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:16,640
LOT OF HANDGUN VIOLENCE AT THE

1329
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,810
TIME, SO I -- I UNDERSTAND THE

1330
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:21,378
ISSUE BUT AS A JUDGE, MY JOB, AS

1331
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:24,181
I SAW IT, WAS TO FOLLOW THE

1332
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:26,083
SECOND AMENDMENT OPINION OF THE

1333
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:26,416
SUPREME COURT.

1334
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:27,985
WHETHER I AGREED WITH IT OR

1335
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:28,485
DISAGREED WITH IT.

1336
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:33,357
AT THE END OF THE OPINION I

1337
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:36,026
CITED JUSTICE KENNEDY'S TEXAS V.

1338
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:37,427
JOHNSON QUOTE WHICH I READ AS

1339
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:38,729
GUIDING LIGHT FOR THE LOWER

1340
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:39,729
COURT JUDGES AND ALL JUDGES.

1341
00:46:39,796 --> 00:46:41,231
>> LET ME GIVE YOU A COUPLE

1342
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:43,100
OTHER QUOTES BECAUSE I'M GOING

1343
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,268
TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

1344
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:45,636
DO YOU AGREE WITH JUSTICE

1345
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:49,106
O'CONNOR THAT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO

1346
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:52,376
CONTROL HER REPRODUCTIVE LIFE

1347
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:53,744
IMPACTS HER ABILITY TO, QUOTE

1348
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:55,178
PARTICIPATE EQUALLY IN THE

1349
00:46:55,178 --> 00:46:58,015
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL LIFE OF THE

1350
00:46:58,015 --> 00:46:59,349
NATION, END QUOTE?

1351
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:02,319
>> WELL, AS A GENERAL

1352
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:07,224
PROPOSITION, I UNDERSTAND THE

1353
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:09,159
IMPORTANCE OF THE PRECEDENT SET

1354
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:15,098
FORTH IN ROE V. WADE.

1355
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:18,101
SO ROE V. WADE, IN PLANNED

1356
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:23,207
PARENTHOOD, A WOMAN HAS A RIGHT

1357
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:24,541
TO OBTAIN A LEGAL ABORTION,

1358
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:27,311
SUBJECT TO VIOLATION OF THE STAY

1359
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:27,811
WHERE THAT REGULATION

1360
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:29,947
CONSTITUTES AN UNDUE BURDEN ON

1361
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:33,016
THE WOMAN'S RIGHT TO OBTAIN AN

1362
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,319
ABORTION AND ONE OF THE REASONS

1363
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:37,020
FOR THAT HOLDING AS EXPLAINED BY

1364
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,490
THE COURT, IN ROE AND ALSO IN

1365
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:41,658
PLANNED PARENTHOOD VERSUS CASEY

1366
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:44,461
MORE FULLY, IS ALONG THE LINES

1367
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:46,330
OF WHAT YOU SAID, SENATOR

1368
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:50,267
FEINSTEIN, ABOUT THE QUOTE FROM

1369
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:50,667
JUSTICE O'CONNOR.

1370
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:56,607
SO THAT'S ONE OF THE RATIONALES

1371
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:57,240
UNDER GERD'S PLANNED PARENTHOOD

1372
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,041
VERSUS CASEY.

1373
00:47:58,108 --> 00:48:04,114
>> LET ME GIVE YOU ANOTHER

1374
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:04,848
RATIONALE.

1375
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:08,318
IN THE 1950s AND '60s, THE TWO

1376
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:11,121
DECADES BEFORE ROE, DEATHS FOR

1377
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:11,889
ILLEGAL ABORTIONS IN THIS

1378
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:17,828
COUNTRY RAN BETWEEN 2 00001.2

1379
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:18,895
MILLION ACCORDING TO THE

1380
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:19,362
GOODMACHER INSTITUTE.

1381
00:48:19,362 --> 00:48:25,936
SO A LOT OF WOMEN DIED IN THAT

1382
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:26,203
PRESIDENT.

1383
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:26,336
.

1384
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:31,508
SO THE QUESTION COMES -- AND YOU

1385
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:33,911
HAVE SAID TODAY -- NOT TODAY BUT

1386
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,046
IT'S BEEN REPORTED THAT YOU HAVE

1387
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:37,681
SAID ROE IS SETTLED LAW.

1388
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:41,618
THE FIRST QUESTION I HAVE OF YOU

1389
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:49,092
IS WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY "SETTLED

1390
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:49,359
LAW "?

1391
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:53,730
I TRIED TO ASK IF YOU BELIEVE IT

1392
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:54,431
IS CORRECT LAW.

1393
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,266
HAVE YOU BELIEVE IT HAS SETTLED

1394
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:57,501
PRECEDENT AND COULD BE

1395
00:48:57,501 --> 00:48:59,269
OVERTURNED AND HAS YOUR VIEWS

1396
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,138
CHANGED SINCE YOU WERE IN THE

1397
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:02,238
BUSH WHITE HOUSE?

1398
00:49:02,305 --> 00:49:04,341
>> SENATOR, I SAID THAT IT'S

1399
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:07,144
SETTLED AS A PRECEDENT OF THE

1400
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:12,682
SUPREME COURT ENTITLED THE

1401
00:49:12,682 --> 00:49:13,350
RESPECT UNDER PRINCIPLES OF

1402
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:16,286
DESIESIS AND ONE OF THE

1403
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:17,320
IMPORTANT THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND

1404
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,157
ABOUT ROE V. WADE IS IT HAS BEEN

1405
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:22,459
REAFFIRMED OVER THE PAST

1406
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:26,229
45 YEARS AS YOU KNOW, AND MOST

1407
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:27,230
PROMINENTLY, MOST IMPORTANTLY,

1408
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,933
REAFFIRMED IN PLANNED PARENTHOOD

1409
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:31,434
VERSUS CASEY IN 1992.

1410
00:49:31,434 --> 00:49:32,969
AND AS YOU WELL RECALL SENATOR,

1411
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:36,139
I KNOW WHEN THAT CASE CAME UP,

1412
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:39,810
THE SUPREME COURT DIDN'T JUST

1413
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,911
REAFFIRM IT IN PASSING.

1414
00:49:41,911 --> 00:49:45,782
THE COURT SPECIFICALLY WENT

1415
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:48,184
THROUGH ALL THE FACTORS OF STORY

1416
00:49:48,184 --> 00:49:50,420
TO DESIESIS AND WHETHER TO

1417
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:55,225
OVERRULE IT AND JUSTICE KENNEDY,

1418
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:58,028
O'CONNOR, AND JUSTICE SUITOR

1419
00:49:58,028 --> 00:50:00,197
WENT THROUGH THOSE FACTOR IN THE

1420
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:00,497
CASE.

1421
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:07,137
>> SINCE YOU MENTIONED STARRY

1422
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:09,573
DESIESIS, AND WHEN THE PERSON

1423
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:14,444
COMES UP, THE PERSON SAYS I WILL

1424
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:17,214
FOLLOW STARRY DESIESIS, AND THEY

1425
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:18,615
GET CONFIRMED AND THEN THEY

1426
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:18,848
DON'T.

1427
00:50:18,848 --> 00:50:20,350
I THINK GOING INTO IT HOW YOU

1428
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,551
MAKE A JUDGMENT IS REALLY

1429
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:22,853
IMPORTANT TO OUR VOTE AS WHETHER

1430
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,054
TO SUPPORT YOU OR NOT BECAUSE I

1431
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:30,360
DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO THOSE

1432
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,060
DEATH TOLLS IN THIS COUNTRY.

1433
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:32,362
AND I TRULY BELIEVE WOMEN SHOULD

1434
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:40,637
BE ABLE TO CONTROL THEIR OWN

1435
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:43,306
REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS WITHIN

1436
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:48,344
OBVIOUSLY CONCERN FOR A VARIABLE

1437
00:50:48,344 --> 00:50:48,578
FETUS.

1438
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:54,017
>> AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT

1439
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:57,554
OF VIEW, SENATOR, AND HOW PEOPLE

1440
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:01,525
FEEL AND I UNDERSTAND THE

1441
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:03,326
IMPORTANCE OF THE ISSUE.

1442
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:04,161
I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE THAT

1443
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:08,031
PEOPLE ATTACH TO THE ROE V. WADE

1444
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:09,633
DECISION, TO THE PLANNED

1445
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:11,067
PARENTHOOD VERSUS CASEY

1446
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:11,334
DECISION.

1447
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:14,203
I DON'T LIVE IN A BUBBLE.

1448
00:51:14,203 --> 00:51:16,806
I UNDERSTAND -- I LIVE IN THE

1449
00:51:16,806 --> 00:51:17,507
REAL WORLD.

1450
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:18,542
I UNDER THE IMPORTANCE OF THE

1451
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:18,775
ISSUE.

1452
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:20,677
>> MY STAFF JUST PASSED ME A

1453
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:21,811
NOTE -- LET ME READ IT TO YOU

1454
00:51:21,811 --> 00:51:24,314
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A GOOD --

1455
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:26,650
HAVE YOUR VIEWS ABOUT WHETHER

1456
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:31,288
ROE IS SETTLED PRECEDENT CHANGED

1457
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:33,290
SINCE YOU WERE IN THE BUSH WHITE

1458
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:33,523
HOUSE?

1459
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,157
>> MY --

1460
00:51:34,157 --> 00:51:34,757
>> YES OR NO?

1461
00:51:34,824 --> 00:51:37,127
>> I'LL TELL WHAT YOU MY VIEW

1462
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:38,595
IT'S I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S

1463
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:39,296
REFERRING TO ABOUT BUSH WHITE

1464
00:51:39,296 --> 00:51:43,166
HOUSE BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT MY

1465
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:44,400
VIEW IS, WHICH IS IMPORTANT

1466
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,803
PRECEDENT IN THE SUPREME COURT

1467
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:47,404
THAT'S BEEN REAFFIRMED MANY

1468
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:48,939
TIMES BUT PLAN AUDIO AND THIS IS

1469
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:53,476
THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE THAT I

1470
00:51:53,476 --> 00:51:53,876
THINK'S IMPORTANT.

1471
00:51:53,876 --> 00:51:55,512
PLANNED PARENTHOOD VERSUS CASEY

1472
00:51:55,512 --> 00:52:00,584
REAFFIRMED ROWE AND DID SO BY

1473
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:03,853
CONSIDERING THE STARE DECISIS

1474
00:52:03,853 --> 00:52:04,221
FACTORS.

1475
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:06,356
SO CASEY NOW BECOMES A PRECEDENT

1476
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:06,689
ON PRECEDENT.

1477
00:52:06,689 --> 00:52:11,328
IT'S NOT AS IF IT'S A RUN OF THE

1478
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:14,364
MILLCASE OF THE

1479
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:17,600
MILL CASE AND RECONSIDERED, BUT

1480
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:22,472
CASEY RECONSIDER TODAY, A MIED

1481
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,073
THE STARE DECISIS CASE AND

1482
00:52:24,073 --> 00:52:24,440
REAFFIRM TODAY.

1483
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,475
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THAT, AS YOU

1484
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:29,312
MAY SAY THERE ARE OTHER CASES

1485
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,313
LIKE THAT, MIRANDA.

1486
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:30,947
SO MIRANDA'S REAFFIRMED A LOT,

1487
00:52:30,947 --> 00:52:35,885
BUT THEN IN THE DICKERSON CASE

1488
00:52:35,885 --> 00:52:38,355
IN 2000, CHIEF JUSTICE RENQUIST

1489
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:41,925
WRITES THE OPINION CONSIDERING

1490
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:43,893
THE STARE DECISIS FACTORS AND

1491
00:52:43,893 --> 00:52:44,961
REAFFIRMING MIRANDA, EVEN THOUGH

1492
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:47,264
CHIEF JUSTICE WILL RENQUIST WAS

1493
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:49,266
A CRITIC OF MIRANDA THROUGHOUT

1494
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:50,467
HIS CAREER, HE DECIDE TODAY HAD

1495
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:55,205
BEEN SETTLED TOO LONG, HAD BEEN

1496
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:58,275
PRECEDENT TOO LONG AND HE

1497
00:52:58,275 --> 00:52:58,642
REAFFIRM TODAY.

1498
00:52:58,642 --> 00:52:59,342
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

1499
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:03,113
>> I WANT TO SWITCH SUBJECTS AND

1500
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:05,315
ONE LAST QUESTION.

1501
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:07,216
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY YOUR POSITION

1502
00:53:07,216 --> 00:53:11,221
TODAY IS ON A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO

1503
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:11,488
CHOOSE?

1504
00:53:11,554 --> 00:53:12,722
>> AS A JUDGE --

1505
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:13,556
>> AS A JUDGE.

1506
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:15,224
>> AS A JUDGE, IT IS OPINION

1507
00:53:15,224 --> 00:53:18,328
IMPORTANT PRESENT TENT OF THE

1508
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:20,397
SUPREME -- PRECEDENT OF THE

1509
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:25,936
SUPREME COURT AND BY IT I MEAN

1510
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:28,872
ROE V. WADE, PLANNED PARENTHOOD

1511
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,106
VERSUS CASEY.

1512
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:31,708
IT'S ITSELF AN IMPORTANT FACTOR

1513
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,911
TO REMEMBER, AND I UNDERSTAND

1514
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:38,915
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ISSUE,

1515
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:40,617
THE JURIS PRUDENTIAL ISSUE AND I

1516
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:42,152
UNDERSTAND AS BEST I CAN.

1517
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:46,089
I ALWAYS TRY OF THE REAL-WORLD

1518
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:47,591
EFFECTS OF THAT DECISION AS I

1519
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:48,858
TRY TO DO OF ALL THE DECISIONS

1520
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:50,126
OF MY COURT AND OF THE SUPREME

1521
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:50,426
COURT.

1522
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:54,664
>> I THANK YOU FOR THAT.

1523
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:56,466
LET'S GO TO PRESIDENTIAL POWER

1524
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:57,467
FOR A MOMENT.

1525
00:53:57,467 --> 00:54:00,637
YOU WERE PART OF KEN STARR'S

1526
00:54:00,637 --> 00:54:02,872
INDEPENDENT COUNCIL TEAM, WHICH

1527
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:04,040
CONDUCTED A SWEEPING

1528
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:04,607
INVESTIGATION INTO POSSIBLE

1529
00:54:04,607 --> 00:54:07,343
WRONGDOING BY PRESIDENT CLINTON

1530
00:54:07,343 --> 00:54:09,079
AND THE FIRST LADY.

1531
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,114
AT THE TIME, YOU ARGUED FOR

1532
00:54:11,114 --> 00:54:12,615
AGGRESSIVE QUESTIONING OF THE

1533
00:54:12,615 --> 00:54:12,882
PRESIDENT.

1534
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:16,319
YOU DID NOT TAKE THE POSITION

1535
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,221
THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON WAS

1536
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:19,789
IMMUNE FROM INVESTIGATION.

1537
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:21,491
SINCE THEN, YOU HAVE TAKEN THE

1538
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:21,924
OPPOSITE POSITION.

1539
00:54:21,924 --> 00:54:23,793
IN FACT, YOU HAVE SAID THAT --

1540
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:29,065
AND I QUOTE, IF THE PRESIDENT

1541
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:31,534
WERE THE SOLE SUBJECT OF A

1542
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:32,202
CRUCIAL NAME INVESTIGATION, I

1543
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:33,603
WOULD SAY NO ONE SHOULD BE

1544
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,038
INVESTIGATING THAT AT ALL.

1545
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:38,074
WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT AND

1546
00:54:38,074 --> 00:54:40,477
WHAT ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE

1547
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:46,148
A SITTING PRESIDENT COULD BE

1548
00:54:46,148 --> 00:54:46,582
SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL

1549
00:54:46,582 --> 00:54:48,217
INVESTIGATION?

1550
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:49,419
>> AND I APPRECIATE THE SIGN

1551
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:49,619
THERE.

1552
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,187
SO THE LAST SIGN I SHOULD HAVE

1553
00:54:51,187 --> 00:54:53,223
MENTIONED WHILE I WAS UP, THE

1554
00:54:53,223 --> 00:54:53,990
SECOND AMENDMENT SIGN HAD

1555
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:55,892
BRACKETS AROUND PART OF MY QUOTE

1556
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:57,961
AND I'M NOT SURE IF IT WAS THE

1557
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,662
EXACT QUOTE BUT THIS ONE -- I

1558
00:54:59,662 --> 00:55:01,597
JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT.

1559
00:55:01,664 --> 00:55:02,365
>> IS THIS ACCURATE?

1560
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:06,336
>> AS A -- HERE'S WHAT I WAS

1561
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:07,069
SAYING, SENATOR, LET ME EXPLAIN

1562
00:55:07,069 --> 00:55:07,236
IT.

1563
00:55:07,236 --> 00:55:10,273
THE LAST ONE MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE

1564
00:55:10,273 --> 00:55:11,107
BEEN ACCURATE.

1565
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:12,976
I WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT FOR

1566
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:17,414
FOR THE RECORD, IT HAD BRACKETS

1567
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:18,815
FOR MY QUOTE.

1568
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,450
SO WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE STARR

1569
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:21,151
INVESTIGATION, THEN I WORKED

1570
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,886
FIVE AND A HALF YEARS IN THE

1571
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:23,553
WHITE HOUSE.

1572
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:25,922
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT AND

1573
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:27,590
I'LL GET SPECIFICALLY TO YOUR

1574
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:27,857
QUESTION.

1575
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:35,231
SO I WORK IN THE INDEPENDENT

1576
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:37,133
COUNSEL INVESTIGATION, AND THAT

1577
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:38,701
OBVIOUSLY A CONTROVERSIAL MOMENT

1578
00:55:38,701 --> 00:55:40,670
I WISH IT HADN'T HAPPENED.

1579
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:45,708
WE ALL WISH IT HADN'T HAPPENED I

1580
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:47,043
REFLECT ON THAT, A WROTE A

1581
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:47,643
GEORGETOWN ARTICLE REFLECTING

1582
00:55:47,643 --> 00:55:49,479
SOME OF MY THOUGHTS ON THAT AND

1583
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:53,516
SEEMS TO BE A TENDENCY TO GO

1584
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:54,651
THROUGH AND EXPERIENCE, WRITE AN

1585
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:55,184
ARTICLE REFLECTING ON IT.

1586
00:55:55,184 --> 00:55:56,452
AND THEN I WORKED IN THE BUSH

1587
00:55:56,452 --> 00:55:58,788
WHITE HOUSE FOR FIVE AND A HALF

1588
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:03,626
YEARS, AND I WRITE AN ARTICLE IN

1589
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:05,729
THE MINNESOTA LAW REVIEW,

1590
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:06,296
SENATOR KLOVECHAR, IN 2009.

1591
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:07,597
WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA'S IN

1592
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:08,498
OFFICE, I SHOULD POINT OUT.

1593
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:13,002
AND I REFLECTED ON A NUMBER OF

1594
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:19,742
THINGS I HAD LEARNED WORKING IN

1595
00:56:19,742 --> 00:56:21,010
THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL'S OFFICE

1596
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:22,312
AND THE WHITE HOUSE.

1597
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:26,349
ONE OF THEM WAS I PROPOSED

1598
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:27,250
TIMELINES FOR CONSIDERATION OF

1599
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:27,650
JUDICIAL NOMINEES.

1600
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:30,286
I PROPOSED A HUNDRED DAY UP AND

1601
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:30,787
DOWN VOTE.

1602
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:32,355
IT WAS SOMETHING FROM MY

1603
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:33,289
EXPERIENCE I THOUGHT WOULD AVOID

1604
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:35,325
CONTROVERSY AND HAVE RULES OF

1605
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:38,127
THE ROAD SET IF ADVANCE AND I

1606
00:56:38,127 --> 00:56:41,064
PROPOSED THAT SPECIFICALLY FOR

1607
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,065
CONGRESS TO CONSIDER.

1608
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:42,799
OTHER ASPECTS, I SAID --

1609
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:43,767
>> WELL.

1610
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:46,736
>> -- ANOTHER THING I PROPOSED

1611
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,204
WAS FOR CONGRESS TO CONSIDER

1612
00:56:48,204 --> 00:56:52,409
WHETHER IT SHOULD LOOK AT

1613
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,377
CLINTON V. JONES, OR THE CLINTON

1614
00:56:54,377 --> 00:57:00,149
OF CLINTON V. JONES INSTEAD OF

1615
00:57:00,149 --> 00:57:03,219
PRESIDENT, IT IS SUBJECT TO

1616
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:04,253
CONTROVERSY WHILE IN OFFICE.

1617
00:57:04,253 --> 00:57:05,555
THE SUPREME COURT MADE CLEAR AT

1618
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:12,595
THE END OF END OF THE DECISION,

1619
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:13,229
CONGRESS COULD PROVIDE

1620
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:14,464
DEFINITELY OF THE DISPUTES IF

1621
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:15,698
CONGRESS SO WANTED.

1622
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:18,368
SO IN THE MINIMUM LAW REVIEW

1623
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:19,602
ARTICLE I PUT OUT SOME IDEAS

1624
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:25,607
ABOUT WHETHER CONGRESS MAY WANT

1625
00:57:25,607 --> 00:57:30,513
TO THINK ABOUT THAT.

1626
00:57:30,513 --> 00:57:31,214
SENATOR DURBIN ASKED WHAT

1627
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:36,519
CHANGED FROM THAT TIME.

1628
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:38,388
WHAT CHANGED WAS SEPTEMBER 11th.

1629
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:44,027
I THOUGHT VERY DEEPLY AFTER

1630
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:44,894
SEPTEMBER 11th, ABOUT THE

1631
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:45,895
PRESIDENCY AND VERY DEEPLY ABOUT

1632
00:57:45,895 --> 00:57:51,067
THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL

1633
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:54,571
EXPERIENCE AND VERY DEEPLY ABOUT

1634
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:58,475
HOW THOSE THINGS INTERACTED AND

1635
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,942
VERY DEEPLY ABOUT SEEING MR.

1636
00:57:59,942 --> 00:58:00,543
BUSH.

1637
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:04,747
WHEN HE CAME IN, IN THE MORNING

1638
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:05,515
OF SEPTEMBER 12th, PRESIDENT

1639
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:07,350
BUSH SAID THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN

1640
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:08,217
AGAIN AND HE WAS OF

1641
00:58:08,217 --> 00:58:10,787
SINGLE-MINDED FOCUS EVERY

1642
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:12,388
MORNING FOR THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS

1643
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:15,892
FOR PRESIDENT BUSH, IT WAS STILL

1644
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:16,359
SEPTEMBER 12th, 2001.

1645
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:19,329
SINGLE-MINDED FOCUS AND THINKING

1646
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,897
BACK TO THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL

1647
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:22,999
EXRIENCE, AUGUST OF 1998 --

1648
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,200
>> LET --

1649
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,369
>> I PROPOSED SOME IDEAS FOR

1650
00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:26,869
CONGRESS TO CONSIDER.

1651
00:58:26,869 --> 00:58:30,673
THERE WERE IDEAS FOR CONGRESS TO

1652
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:30,940
CONSIDER.

1653
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,276
THEY WERE NOT MY CONSTITUTIONAL

1654
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:33,476
VIEWS.

1655
00:58:33,476 --> 00:58:35,211
IF A CASE CAME UP WHERE SOMEONE

1656
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:37,680
WAS -- SOMEONE WAS TRYING TO SAY

1657
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,515
THIS IS A CONSTITUTIONAL

1658
00:58:39,515 --> 00:58:40,783
PRINCIPAL, I WOUL HAVE A

1659
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:43,319
COMPLETELY OPEN MIND ON THAT

1660
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:44,454
BECAUSE I'VE NEVER TAKEN A

1661
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:47,223
POSITION ON THE CONSTITUTION ON

1662
00:58:47,223 --> 00:58:48,191
THAT QUESTION.

1663
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,259
I'VE ONLY PUT OUT PROPOSALS FOR

1664
00:58:50,259 --> 00:58:51,894
YOU-ALL TO STUDY TO THINK ABOUT

1665
00:58:51,894 --> 00:58:54,197
THE PLANS OF A PRESIDENT

1666
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:56,265
FIGHTING A WAR, LEADING A WAR,

1667
00:58:56,265 --> 00:58:57,900
AND A PRESIDENT SUBJECT TO SAY

1668
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:04,574
ORDINARY CIVIL LAWSUITS AS IN

1669
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:09,312
THE CLINT OP VERSUS JONES CASE.

1670
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:10,580
>> YOU'RE VERY GOOD.

1671
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:11,647
YOU'RE LEARNING THE FILIBUSTER.

1672
00:59:11,647 --> 00:59:12,782
THE SUPREME COURT RULED A

1673
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:14,617
PRESIDENT CAN BE REQUIRED TO

1674
00:59:14,617 --> 00:59:17,253
TURN OVER INFORMATION.

1675
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:19,221
IT UPHELD THE SUBPOENA FOR THE

1676
00:59:19,221 --> 00:59:20,757
TAPES OF OVAL OFFICE

1677
00:59:20,757 --> 00:59:21,958
CONVERSATIONS THAT REVEALED

1678
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:23,960
PRESIDENT NIXON'S EFFORTS TO

1679
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,194
COVER UP THE WATERGATE BREAK-IN.

1680
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:28,097
THIS AS YOU KNOW WAS U.S. V.

1681
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:28,330
NIXON.

1682
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:34,037
YOU HAVE SAID THAT THE NIXON

1683
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:37,740
CASE MIGHT HAVE BEEN WRONGLY

1684
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:38,007
DECIDED.

1685
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:40,076
IS U.S. V. NIXON WRONGLY

1686
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,711
DECIDED, IN YOUR VIEW?

1687
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:43,913
>> SO THAT QUOTE IS NOT IN

1688
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:48,951
CONTEXT AND IS A

1689
00:59:48,951 --> 00:59:50,687
MISUNDERSTANDING OF MY POSITION

1690
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:51,287
THAT'S UP THERE.

1691
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:53,022
I HAVE REPEATEDLY CALLED U.S. V.

1692
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:58,594
NIXON ONE OF THE FOUR GREATEST

1693
00:59:58,594 --> 01:00:00,329
MOMENTS IN SUPREME COURT

1694
01:00:00,329 --> 01:00:00,562
HISTORY.

1695
01:00:00,562 --> 01:00:05,768
SO I'VE CALLED THAT -- THE FOUR

1696
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:07,270
I'VE ALWAYS IDENTIFIED ARE

1697
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,438
MARBERRY VERSUS MADISON,

1698
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,306
YOUNGSTOWN STEEL, AND UNITED

1699
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:12,475
STATES VERSUS RICHARD NIXON, AND

1700
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:14,010
WHY HAVE I -- BROWN VERSUS

1701
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:18,581
BOARD, THE SINGLE GREATEST --

1702
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:19,882
>> WAS IT RIGHTLY DECIDED?

1703
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:23,219
>> I HAVE SAID YES, THE COURT'S

1704
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:25,922
HOLDING A CRIMINAL TRIAL

1705
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:31,227
SUBPOENA TO A PRESIDENT IN THE

1706
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:35,064
CONTEXT OF THE -- OF THE SPECIAL

1707
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:38,267
COUNSEL REGULATONS IN THAT

1708
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:39,235
CASE, FOR INFORMATION, A

1709
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:40,570
CRIMINAL TRIAL SUBPOENA FOR

1710
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:41,838
INFORMATION UNDER THE SPECIFIC

1711
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:43,372
REGULATIONS IN THAT CASE, I HAVE

1712
01:00:43,372 --> 01:00:46,876
SAID THAT HOLDING IS ONE OF THE

1713
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:48,344
FOUR GREATEST MOMENTS IN SUPREME

1714
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:48,711
COURT HISTORY.

1715
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:51,948
SO NOT ONLY WHAT I WAS -- I CAN

1716
01:00:51,948 --> 01:00:52,615
CHAIN HOW THAT MISUNDERSTANDING

1717
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:53,883
CAME UP BECAUSE THAT'S -- I KNOW

1718
01:00:53,883 --> 01:00:56,419
THERE WAS A NEWS STORY ABOUT

1719
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:58,721
THAT AND THAT'S JUST NOT CORRECT

1720
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:00,156
IMPRESSION OF MY VIEWS.

1721
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:01,023
MY VIEWS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT.

1722
01:01:01,023 --> 01:01:03,626
WHY WAS IT ONE OF THE GREATEST

1723
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:03,859
MOMENTS?

1724
01:01:03,859 --> 01:01:05,394
IT WAS ONE OF GREATEST MOMENTS

1725
01:01:05,394 --> 01:01:06,596
BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL

1726
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:07,964
PRESSURES OF THE TIME.

1727
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:11,334
THE COURT STOOD UP FOR JUDICIAL

1728
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:17,240
INDEPENDENCE IN A MOMENT OF

1729
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:17,607
NATIONAL CRISIS.

1730
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:18,708
THAT'S WHEN THE SUPREME COURT --

1731
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:19,776
WE NEED THE SUPREME COURT TO

1732
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:21,944
DECIDE SOME OF THE THINGS WE CAN

1733
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:22,110
SEE.

1734
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:23,112
WE'LL HAVE CRISIS MOMENTS FOR

1735
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:25,515
THE SUPREME COURT ON THINGS WE

1736
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:26,349
CAN'T EVEN PREDICT AND WE NEED

1737
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:29,986
PEOPLE ON THE SUPREME COURT WHO

1738
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:31,320
ARE PREPARED FOR THAT AND U.S.

1739
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:32,054
V. NIXON --

1740
01:01:32,054 --> 01:01:34,290
>> MY TIME IS GOING TO RUN OUT

1741
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:34,624
VERY QUICKLY.

1742
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:36,559
LET ME ASK YOU THIS, CAN A

1743
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,161
SITTING PRESIDENT BE REQUIRED TO

1744
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:40,662
RESPOND TO A SUBPOENA?

1745
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:44,167
>> SO THAT'S A HYPOTHETICAL

1746
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:47,704
QUESTION ABOUT WHAT WOULD BE AN

1747
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,906
ELABORATION OR A DIFFERENCE FROM

1748
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:51,207
U.S. V. NIXON'S PRECISE HOLDING

1749
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:53,142
AND I THINK GOING WITH THE

1750
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:55,311
JUSTICE GINSBURG PRINCIPAL,

1751
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:59,682
WHICH IS REALLY NOT THE JUSTICE

1752
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:00,416
GINSBURG ALONE PRINCIPLE, IT'S

1753
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:01,784
EVERYONE'S PRINCIPLE ON THE

1754
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:03,786
SUPREME COURT AND AS A MATTER OF

1755
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:05,421
CANONS OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENT I

1756
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:07,089
CAN'T GIVE YOU AN ANSWER ON THAT

1757
01:02:07,089 --> 01:02:07,589
HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION.

1758
01:02:07,656 --> 01:02:10,426
>> SO YOU CAN'T GIVE ME AN

1759
01:02:10,426 --> 01:02:12,461
ANSWER ON WHETHER A PRESIDENT

1760
01:02:12,461 --> 01:02:15,298
HAS TO RESPOND TO A SUBPOENA

1761
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:17,566
FROM A COURT OF LAW?

1762
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:20,369
>> IT'S MY -- MY UNDERSTANDING

1763
01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:23,806
IS THAT YOU'RE ASKING ME TO GIVE

1764
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:25,541
MY VIEW ON A POTENTIAL

1765
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:28,511
HYPOTHETICAL AND THAT'S

1766
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:29,545
SOMETHING THAT THE -- EVERY --

1767
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:36,853
EACH OF THE EIGHT JUSTICES, WHEN

1768
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:39,889
THEY'RE SIT IN MY SEAT, DECLINED

1769
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:40,556
TO DECIDE POTENTIAL HYPOTHETICAL

1770
01:02:40,556 --> 01:02:40,756
CASES.

1771
01:02:40,756 --> 01:02:44,393
I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT THE U.S. V.

1772
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:47,363
NIXON PRECEDENT AND I DID ABOUT

1773
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:50,032
CHIEF BURGER'S ROLE IN A

1774
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:50,432
UNANIMOUS OPINION.

1775
01:02:50,432 --> 01:02:56,439
CHIEF JUSTICE BERGER WHO WAS

1776
01:02:56,439 --> 01:03:01,978
APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT NIXON,

1777
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:03,813
WRITES THE OPINION ORDERING

1778
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:06,015
PRESIDENT NIXON TO DISCLOSE THE

1779
01:03:06,015 --> 01:03:08,417
TAPES IN RESPONSE TO A CRIMINAL

1780
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:08,784
TRIAL SUBPOENA.

1781
01:03:08,784 --> 01:03:11,220
A MOMENT OF CRISIS ARGUMENT I

1782
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:14,857
THINK JULY 8th, 1974, THEY

1783
01:03:14,857 --> 01:03:17,894
DECIDED TWO WEEKS LATER, REALLY

1784
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:18,528
IMPORTANT OPINION, MOMENT OF

1785
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:19,262
JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE,

1786
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:19,896
PERSONALITY PRECEDENT OF THE

1787

SUPREME COURT, BUT HOW THAT

1788
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:26,469
WOULD APPLY TO OTHER

1789
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:27,937

THAT COULD COME BEFORE ME.

1795

SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE

1871
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:38,394
SUGGESTED THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

1872
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:41,130
NOMINATED YOU BECAUSE HE THOUGHT

1873
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:44,200
YOU'D RULER IN HIS FAVOR, SHOULD

PRESIDENT?

1911
01:07:49,498 --> 01:07:50,599
HOW WILL THAT LOYALTY DIFFER

1912
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:56,071
FROM THE LOYALTY YOU OWE TO SAY

1913
01:07:56,071 --> 01:07:56,538
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE?

1914
01:07:56,604 --> 01:07:57,773
>> SENATOR, IF CONFIRMED TO THE

01:07:57,773 --> 01:07:59,308
SUPREME COURT AND AS A SITTING

01:07:59,308 --> 01:08:05,247
JUDGE I OWE MY LOYALTY TO THE

1917
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:05,580
CONSTITUTION.

1918
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:08,284
THAT'S WHAT I OWE LOYALTY TO.

1919
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:08,918
THE CONSTITUTION ESTABLISHES ME

1920
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:12,688
AS AN INDEPENDENT JUDGE BOUND TO

FOLLOW THE LAW AS WRITTEN.

1922
01:08:13,822 --> 01:08:18,861
THE PRECEDENCE OF THE SUPREME

01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:23,232
COURT AS ARTICULATED SUBJECT TO

1924
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:24,366
THE RULES OF STARRE DECISIS.

1925
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:26,902
>> YOU WERE APPOINTED BY THE

1926
01:08:26,902 --> 01:08:28,938
ADMINISTRATION OF GEORGE W BUSH.

1927
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,506
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY YOU

1928
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:31,439
WERE CLOSE TO PRESIDENT BUSH.

1929
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:32,774
YOU WORKED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS

1930
01:08:32,774 --> 01:08:33,274
FOR HIM.

1931
01:08:33,274 --> 01:08:35,678
CAN YOU GIVE A SUM OF EXAMPLE OF

1932
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:38,314
CASES IN WHICH YOU RULED AGAINST

1933
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:38,913
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION,

1934
01:08:38,913 --> 01:08:39,948
NOTWITHSTANDING PRESIDENT BUSH

1935
01:08:39,948 --> 01:08:43,719
WAS THE ONE WHO PUT YOU ON THE

1936
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:43,952
BENCH.

1937
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:45,688
>> SENATOR, THE MOST PROMINENT

1938
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:48,357
EXAMPLE IS THE HAMDAN CASE, THE

1939
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:49,058
MILITARY COMMISSIONS CASE, A

1940
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:54,430
SGNATURE PROSECUTION OF THE

1941
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:54,863
BUSH ADMINISTRATION.

1942
01:08:54,863 --> 01:08:56,432
THEY HAD ESTABLISHED WITH

1943
01:08:56,432 --> 01:08:57,533
CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORIZATION

1944
01:08:57,533 --> 01:08:58,634
EVENTUALLY AFTER A UNILATERAL

1945
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:00,736
EFFORT DIDN'T SUCCEED IN THE

1946
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:02,504
COURTS, ESTABLISHED MILITARY

1947
01:09:02,504 --> 01:09:04,106
COMMISSIONS, THE MILITARY

1948
01:09:04,106 --> 01:09:07,309
COMMISSIONS WERE TO TRY

1949
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:09,979
AL-QAEDA, TERRORISTS WHO HAD

1950
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:13,549
COMMITTED WAR CRIMES AND ONE

1951
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:17,486
CASE CAME US TO, SALIM HAMDAN,

1952
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:19,220
AND THE QUESTION WAS, WAS THE

1953
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:20,522
PROSECUTION UNLAWFUL BECAUSE THE

1954
01:09:20,522 --> 01:09:22,091
CRIME OF WHICH HE WAS CONVICTED

1955
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:24,093
WAS NOT AN IDENTIFIED CRIME AS

1956
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:29,798
OF 2001, WHEN HE WAS ALLEGED TO

1957
01:09:29,798 --> 01:09:30,332
HAVE COMMITTED IT.

1958
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:34,336
E POST FACTOR PRINCIPLES, AND I

1959
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:36,639
WROTE THE OPINION REVERSING HIS

1960
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:38,040
CONVICTION HE WAS THOUGH IT WAS

1961
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:38,941
A SIGNATURE PROSECUTION OF THE

1962
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:42,011
UNITED STATES, EVEN THOUGH IT

1963
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:42,944
WAS A NATIONAL SECURITY CASE

1964
01:09:42,944 --> 01:09:44,479
BECAUSE THAT'S THE RIGHT ANSWER

1965
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:45,481
UNDER THE LAW AND DOESN'T MATTER

1966
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:47,316
WHO YOU ARE AND WHERE YOU COME

1967
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:49,350
FROM, IF YOU'RE RIGHT UNDER THE

1968
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:49,984
LAW, YOU PREVAIL.

1969
01:09:50,051 --> 01:09:53,022
>> I'D LIKE TO TURN TO YOUR WORK

1970
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,423
IN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION.

1971
01:09:54,423 --> 01:09:59,261
AS YOU KNOW, MY DEMOCRATIC

1972
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:01,497
COLLEAGUES ARE DEMANDING TO SEE

1973
01:10:01,497 --> 01:10:02,765
EVERY PIECE OF PAPER OR EVERY

1974
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:05,334
SINGLE SCRAP OF PAPER YOU EVER

01:10:05,334 --> 01:10:06,936
TOUCHED DURING YOUR SIX YEARS

1976
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:07,870
DURING THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION

1977
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,038
IN PART BECAUSE THEY WANT TO

1978
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:12,041
KNOW WHAT ROLE, IF ANY, YOU

1979
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:15,377
PLAYED IN DEVELOPING THE BUSH

1980
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:16,679
ADMINISTRATION'S INTERROGATION

1981
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:16,979
POLICIES.

1982
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:18,113

CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE

1985
01:10:19,948 --> 01:10:21,684
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND A

1986
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:24,953
GOOD ONE AT THAT, ISSUED A

1987
01:10:24,953 --> 01:10:27,155
LENGTHY REPORT ON THE CIA'S

01:10:27,155 --> 01:10:29,624
INTENTION AND INTERROGATION

1989
01:10:29,624 --> 01:10:33,462
PROGRAM UNDER PRESIDENT BUSH.

1990
01:10:33,462 --> 01:10:36,532
THE REPORT DETAILED THE ORIGINS,

1991
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:38,100
DEVELOPMENT, AND IMPLEMENTATION

1992
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:39,068
OF THE PROGRAM.

1993
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:41,002
IN 2014, A DECLASSIFIED VERSION

1994
01:10:41,002 --> 01:10:45,407
OF THAT REPORT WAS RELEASED TO

1995
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:45,807
THE PUBLIC.

1996
01:10:45,807 --> 01:10:48,310
THE DECLASSIFIED VERSION OR

1997
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:51,213
REPORT RUNS WELL OVER 500 PAGES.

1998
01:10:51,213 --> 01:10:54,116
AND YOUR NAME APPEARS NOWHERE IN

1999
01:10:54,116 --> 01:10:54,450

2000
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:56,452
NOW, I MYSELF SPENT OVER

2001
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:57,586
20 YEARS ON THE INTELLIGENCE

2002
01:10:57,586 --> 01:10:57,853

2003
01:10:57,853 --> 01:11:02,591
I KNOW THE QUALITY OF ITS STAFF

2004
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:04,059
AND THE WORK THAT THEY DO.

2005
01:11:04,059 --> 01:11:05,427
AND I KNOW THE RANKING MEMBER

2006
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:07,162

2007
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:14,670
IF YOU PLAYED A ROLE IN THE BUSH

2008
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:15,304
ADMINISTRATION INTERROGATION

2009
01:11:15,304 --> 01:11:17,172
POLICIES, I THINK THEY WOULD

2010
01:11:17,172 --> 01:11:17,606
HAVE DISCOVERED IT.

2011
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:19,208
NUMEROUS PEOPLE ARE IN THE

2012
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:21,143
REPORT BUT NOT YOU AND THAT

2013
01:11:21,143 --> 01:11:21,676

WITH THAT SAID I WANT TO ASK YOU

YEAR OUT OF 37.

2174
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:04,880
AND SHE WROTE A STORY ABOUT THAT

2175
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:10,252
AND THAT SEEMED VERY ODD AND

2176
01:18:10,252 --> 01:18:11,286
UNACCEPTABLE AND I STARTED

2177
01:18:11,286 --> 01:18:12,453
THINKING ABOUT WHAT I COULD DO.

2178
01:18:12,453 --> 01:18:13,989
FIRST OF ALL WHY IS THAT

2179
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:15,757
HAPPENING AND WHAT COULD I DO

2180
01:18:15,757 --> 01:18:17,292

FULLY REPRESENTED IN THOSE.

2189
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:40,682
I MADE SURE WHEN I WAS TALKING

2190
01:18:40,682 --> 01:18:43,218
TO PROFESSORS AT LAW SCHOOLS, I

2191
01:18:43,218 --> 01:18:47,789

2199
01:19:11,613 --> 01:19:17,519
THAT WAS THE START OF MY EFFORTS

2200
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:19,020
TO MAKE SURE WOMEN WERE NOT

2201
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:21,189
BEING EXCLUDED AND I REALLY

2202
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:24,292
WORKED ON WHY IS THIS HAPPENING

2203
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:25,560
SO YALE LAW WOMEN STUDIED ABOUT

2204
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,329
FIVE YEARS AGO ABOUT

2205
01:19:27,329 --> 01:19:29,197
PARTICIPATION IN CLASS, THE

2206
01:19:29,197 --> 01:19:31,233
DIFFERENCES ON WHO GETS CALLED

2207
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:34,469
IN ON CLASS AND THERE IS SLIGHT

2208
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:35,069
DIFFERENCES THERE.

2209
01:19:35,069 --> 01:19:38,006
MEN AND WOMEN WHO THEN GET

2210
01:19:38,006 --> 01:19:39,741
SELECTED AS RESEARCH ASSISTANTS,

2211
01:19:39,741 --> 01:19:41,843
SLIGHT DIFFERENCES THERE, AND IT

2212
01:19:41,843 --> 01:19:44,279
JUST KEEPS BUILDING UNTIL YOU

2213
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:46,448
GET A DISPARITY IN THE CLERK

2214
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:47,182
NETWORK.

2215
01:19:47,182 --> 01:19:48,516
AND THERE IS A PIPELINE PROBLEM.

2216
01:19:48,516 --> 01:19:49,918
I'VE SAID I'M BREAKING THROUGH

2217
01:19:49,918 --> 01:19:50,518
THAT PROBLEM.

2218
01:19:50,518 --> 01:19:53,722
I'M NOT -- I'M NOT LISTENING TO

2219
01:19:53,722 --> 01:19:54,322
THAT.

2220
01:19:54,322 --> 01:19:56,358
AND SO I'VE BEEN VERY AGGRESSIVE

2221
01:19:56,358 --> 01:19:58,493
ABOUT HEURING THE BEST AND

2222
01:19:58,493 --> 01:19:59,227
UNDERSTANDING THE BEST INCLUDE

2223
01:19:59,227 --> 01:20:01,529
WOMEN -- HIRING THE BEST AND THE

2224
01:20:01,529 --> 01:20:04,666
BEST INCLUDE WOMEN AND AS YOU

2225
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:07,035
SAY, SENATOR, A MAJORITY OF MY

2226
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:07,568
CLERKS HAVE BEEN WOMEN.

2227
01:20:07,568 --> 01:20:10,171
25 -- I BELIEVE 21 OF THEM HAVE

2228
01:20:10,171 --> 01:20:12,841
GONE ON TO CLERK AT THE SUPREME

2229
01:20:12,841 --> 01:20:14,042
COURT AND THEY'RE AN AWESOME

2230
01:20:14,042 --> 01:20:16,611
GROUP AND IF CONFIRMED TO THE

2231
01:20:16,611 --> 01:20:18,880
SUPREME COURT, I WILL CONTINUE

2232
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:19,881
TO DO THIS.

2233
01:20:19,881 --> 01:20:22,851
WHAT IT TAKES -- AND I THINK --

2234
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:24,185
MY MOM SHOWED ME THIS, PRESIDENT

2235
01:20:24,185 --> 01:20:25,687
BUSH SHOWED ME THIS A LITTLE.

2236
01:20:25,687 --> 01:20:27,188
WHAT IT TAKES IS JUST NOT

2237
01:20:27,188 --> 01:20:30,158
ACCEPTING THE SAME OLD ANSWER,

2238
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:31,326
OH, THERE IS A DISPARITY.

2239
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:34,496
WELL, WHY AND THEN DO SOMETHING

2240
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:34,762
ABOUT IT.

2241
01:20:34,762 --> 01:20:36,398
AND I TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHY

2242
01:20:36,398 --> 01:20:38,800
AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT MINORITY

2243
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:41,369
CLERKS, TOO, BUT ON WOMEN, WHY

2244
01:20:41,369 --> 01:20:44,673
WERE THOSE DISPARITIES EXISTING

2245
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:45,140
AS DESCRIBED BY LINDA

2246
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:45,440
GREENHOUSE.

2247
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,942
AND I TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHY

2248
01:20:46,942 --> 01:20:48,610
AND I DID SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

2249
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:50,311
I'M VERY PROUD OF THAT BECAUSE I

2250
01:20:50,311 --> 01:20:52,547
DO BELIEVE THAT ALL PEOPLE

2251
01:20:52,547 --> 01:20:54,783
SHOULD BE TREATED EQUALLY AND

2252
01:20:54,783 --> 01:20:58,220
THE LAW CLERK POSITION, WHICH

2253
01:20:58,220 --> 01:20:59,988
MAY SOUND MINISTERIAL, INTO SOME

2254
01:20:59,988 --> 01:21:01,623
EXTENT, THE JOB IS HELPING THE

2255
01:21:01,623 --> 01:21:03,959
JOB AND CERTAINLY OUT OF LAW

2256
01:21:03,959 --> 01:21:05,894
SCHOOL, BUT THOSE POSITIONS ARE

2257
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:07,229
VERY IMPORTANT LAUNCHING PADS

2258
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:08,262
FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF

2259
01:21:08,262 --> 01:21:08,496
LEADERS.

2260
01:21:08,496 --> 01:21:10,332
THE PEOPLE WILL BE SITTING IN

2261
01:21:10,332 --> 01:21:10,699
THESE SEATS.

2262
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:12,533
PEOPLE WILL BE SITTING IN MY

2263
01:21:12,533 --> 01:21:12,734
SEAT.

2264
01:21:12,734 --> 01:21:15,503
LOTS OF THEM ARE GOING TO COME

2265
01:21:15,503 --> 01:21:21,910
IF LAW CLERKS SO IF WE'RE NOT

2266
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:23,578
BEING INCLUSIVE NOW, THAT'LL

2267
01:21:23,578 --> 01:21:25,213
SHOW UP LATER.

2268
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:26,848
IT'S BEEN A CRITICAL PART I'M

2269
01:21:26,848 --> 01:21:30,318
ALL FOCUSED AT ALL TIMES, IS A

2270
01:21:30,318 --> 01:21:31,286
QUALITY IN THE CLERKSHIP PROCESS

2271
01:21:31,286 --> 01:21:35,023
AND MAKING SURE WOMEN ARE

2272
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:35,723
GETTING THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES

2273
01:21:35,723 --> 01:21:36,758
THAT MEN ARE.

2274
01:21:36,825 --> 01:21:40,061
>> THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION.

2275
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:43,898
>> AND THANK YOU FOR THE ANSWER.

2276
01:21:43,898 --> 01:21:49,537
I THINK IT DISTINGUISHES YOU.

2277
01:21:49,537 --> 01:21:53,608
LATE LAST YEAR, ALLEGATIONS

2278
01:21:53,608 --> 01:21:56,544
AGAINST THE FORMER 9th CIRCUIT

2279
01:21:56,544 --> 01:21:59,214
JUDGE, WOMEN DETAILED AN ARTICLE

2280
01:21:59,214 --> 01:22:01,483
DETAILING DISTURBING CONDUCT BY

2281
01:22:01,483 --> 01:22:02,117
THE JUDGE.

2282
01:22:02,117 --> 01:22:06,621
YOU CLERKED FOR HIM FOR ONE YEAR

2283
01:22:06,621 --> 01:22:06,954
IN 1991-1992.

2284
01:22:06,954 --> 01:22:08,556
SOME OF YOUR OPPONENTS HAVE

2285
01:22:08,556 --> 01:22:10,725
SUGGESTED YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN

2286
01:22:10,725 --> 01:22:13,527
ABOUT THESE ALLEGATIONS.

2287
01:22:13,527 --> 01:22:15,063
THIS SEEMS TO BE AN EFFORT GUILT

2288
01:22:15,063 --> 01:22:17,399
BY ASSOCIATION, WHICH IS NOT THE

2289
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:18,666
WAYS THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD

2290
01:22:18,666 --> 01:22:19,233
OPERATE AT ANY WAY.

2291
01:22:19,233 --> 01:22:22,103
WITH THAT IN MIND I WANT TO GIVE

2292
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:25,907
YOU A CHANCE TO ANSWER A FEW

2293
01:22:25,907 --> 01:22:28,276
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE JUDGE SO

2294
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:29,811
WE'RE OPERATING ON THE SAME

2295
01:22:29,811 --> 01:22:30,244
FOUNDATION EFFECTS.

2296
01:22:30,244 --> 01:22:33,048
FIRST, HOW LONG YOU HAVE KNOWN

2297
01:22:33,048 --> 01:22:33,915
JUDGE KEZINSKY?

2298
01:22:33,982 --> 01:22:42,757
>> I CLERKED FOR HIM 1991-'92.

2299
01:22:42,757 --> 01:22:43,925
SECOND I UNDER FROM MEDIA

2300
01:22:43,925 --> 01:22:46,227
REPORTS THE JUDGE OPERATED AN

2301
01:22:46,227 --> 01:22:48,830
E-MAIL LIST WHERE HE WOULD SEND

2302
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:49,330
INAPPROPRIATE MATERIAL.

2303
01:22:49,330 --> 01:22:49,964
WERE YOU ON THIS E-MAIL LIST?

2304
01:22:50,031 --> 01:22:51,031
>> I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING

2305
01:22:51,031 --> 01:22:52,100
LIKE THAT, SENATOR.

2306
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:55,236
>> HOW OFTEN DID YOU TALK WITH

2307
01:22:55,236 --> 01:22:57,972
THE JUDGE ON THE PHONE?

2308
01:22:58,039 --> 01:22:58,373
>> NOT OFTEN.

2309
01:22:58,373 --> 01:22:58,773
NOT OFTEN, SIR.

2310
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:03,244
>> HOW OFTEN DID YOU SEE HIM IN

2311
01:23:03,244 --> 01:23:03,511
PERSON?

2312
01:23:03,577 --> 01:23:04,546
>> AGAIN, NOT OFTEN.

2313
01:23:04,546 --> 01:23:06,614
MAYBE WHEN THERE WAS A LEGAL

2314
01:23:06,614 --> 01:23:07,215
CONVENTION OR --

2315
01:23:07,215 --> 01:23:08,649
>> THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE

2316
01:23:08,649 --> 01:23:09,884
DON'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND.

2317
01:23:09,951 --> 01:23:14,555
>> I WAS NOT WORKING -- HE WAS

2318
01:23:14,555 --> 01:23:16,491
IN THE PASADENA COURTHOUSE IN

2319
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:17,726
CALIFORNIA WITH -- A SMALL

2320
01:23:17,726 --> 01:23:19,127
COURTHOUSE WITH TEN OTHER COURT

OF APPEALS JUDGES IN THAT

2322
01:23:21,129 --> 01:23:21,429
COURTHOUSE.

2323
01:23:21,429 --> 01:23:22,697
I OF COURSE WAS WORKING IN

2324
01:23:22,697 --> 01:23:23,364
WASHINGTON, D.C.

2325
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:27,001
>> WHEN YOU DID SEE AND TALK

2326
01:23:27,001 --> 01:23:29,938
WITH JUDGE KEZINSKY, WHAT TYPE

2327
01:23:29,938 --> 01:23:30,905
OF THINGS DID YOU TALK ABOUT?

2328
01:23:30,972 --> 01:23:34,142
>> WE WERE AMONG THE 12

2329
01:23:34,142 --> 01:23:35,910
COAUTHORS OF THE BRIAN GARNER

2330
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:37,245
LED BOOK ON JUDICIAL PRECEDENT,

2331
01:23:37,245 --> 01:23:39,614
SO FOR LEVEL YEARS THAT WAS A

2332
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:41,282
PROJECT ALL OF US WERE -- THE 12

2333
01:23:41,282 --> 01:23:46,187
OF US I GUESS IT WAS IN TOTAL

2334
01:23:46,187 --> 01:23:47,322
WERE WORKING ON THAT.

2335
01:23:47,322 --> 01:23:50,525
DIANE WOOD CHIEF JUDGE OF THE

2336
01:23:50,525 --> 01:23:52,293
SEVENTH CIRCUIT AND JUSTICE

2337
01:23:52,293 --> 01:23:53,061
GORSUCH WAS A COAUTHOR SO WE

2338
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:56,564
WORKED WITH THAT AS A GROUP AND

2339
01:23:56,564 --> 01:23:58,867
JUSTICE KENNEDY FOR THE LAST

2340
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:01,336
30 YEARS, HAD JUDGE KEZINSKY RUN

2341
01:24:01,336 --> 01:24:03,304
HIS -- RUN JUSTICE KENNEDY'S LAW

2342
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:07,308
CLERK HIRING PROCESS AND IN THE

2343
01:24:07,308 --> 01:24:09,511
COURSE OF THAT PROCESS, I WOULD

2344
01:24:09,511 --> 01:24:10,879
HAVE COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE

2345
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:11,112
JUDGE.

2346
01:24:11,179 --> 01:24:12,814
>> OKAY.

2347
01:24:12,814 --> 01:24:17,652
DID YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

2348
01:24:17,652 --> 01:24:18,085
THESE ALLEGATIONS?

2349
01:24:18,152 --> 01:24:18,486
>> NOTHING.

2350
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:19,120
>> OKAY.

2351
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:22,490
BEFORE THEY BECAME PUBLIC LAST

2352
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:22,957
YEAR?

2353
01:24:23,024 --> 01:24:23,357
>> NO.

2354
01:24:23,357 --> 01:24:25,527
WHEN THEY BECAME PUBLIC, NO, THE

2355
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:27,829
FIRST THOUGHT I HAD WAS NO WOMAN

2356
01:24:27,829 --> 01:24:32,200
SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO SEXUAL

2357
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:34,335
HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE

2358
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:36,504
EVER, INCLUDING IN JUDICIARY,

2359
01:24:36,504 --> 01:24:38,039
ESPECIALLY IN THE JUDICIARY.

2360
01:24:38,039 --> 01:24:39,240
AND WHEN I HEARD -- WHEN IT

2361
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:42,510
BECAME PUBLIC, I THINK IT WAS IN

2362
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:43,511
DECEMBER, IT WAS A GUT PUNCH.

2363
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:44,946
IT WAS A GUT PUNCH FOR ME.

2364
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:46,814
>> IT WAS MORE ME, TOO.

2365
01:24:46,881 --> 01:24:54,322
>> IT WAS A GUN PUNCH FOR THE

2366
01:24:54,322 --> 01:25:00,261
JUDICIARY AND I WAS SHOCKED AND

2367
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:00,828
DISAPPOINTED, ANGRY, SWIRLED

2368
01:25:00,828 --> 01:25:01,162
EMOTIONS.

2369
01:25:01,162 --> 01:25:02,497
NO WOMAN SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO

2370
01:25:02,497 --> 01:25:04,833
SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE

2371
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:07,235
WORKPLACE AND I APPLAUD CHIEF

2372
01:25:07,235 --> 01:25:10,071
JUSTICE ROBERTS APPOINTED

2373
01:25:10,071 --> 01:25:13,140
COMMITTEE OF JUDGES TO ESTABLISH

2374
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:13,541
BETTER PROCEDURES.

2375
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:14,809
CHIEF JUDGE SCARWIN DID THE SAME

2376
01:25:14,809 --> 01:25:16,677
THING FOR OUR COURT AND THOSE

2377
01:25:16,677 --> 01:25:17,345
ARE FIRST STEPS.

2378
01:25:17,345 --> 01:25:21,382
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE FINAL

2379
01:25:21,382 --> 01:25:22,350
STEPS BY ANY STRETCH.

2380
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:28,356
AND WHAT -- THIS IS PART OF A

2381
01:25:28,356 --> 01:25:29,056
MUCH LARGER NATIONAL PROBLEM OF

2382
01:25:29,056 --> 01:25:31,826
ABUSE AND HARASSMENT AND ONE OF

2383
01:25:31,826 --> 01:25:35,263
THE THINGS WE'VE LEARNED IS WE

2384
01:25:35,263 --> 01:25:36,697
NEED BETTER REPORTING

2385
01:25:36,697 --> 01:25:38,533
MECHANISMS, WOMEN IN PARTICULAR

2386
01:25:38,533 --> 01:25:41,002
IN THE WORKPLACE, NEED TO KNOW

2387
01:25:41,002 --> 01:25:44,038
IF THEY'RE THE VICTIM OF

2388
01:25:44,038 --> 01:25:46,474
HARASSMENT, WHERE TO REPORT IT,

2389
01:25:46,474 --> 01:25:49,810
IMMEDIATELY WHO TO REPORT IT TO.

2390
01:25:49,810 --> 01:25:51,112
THEY NEED TO BE KNOWN -- KNOW

2391
01:25:51,112 --> 01:25:52,814
THEY'LL BE SAFE IF THEY REPORT

2392
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:52,980
IT.

2393
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:54,148
THEY NEED TO HAVE A SAFE WORKING

2394
01:25:54,148 --> 01:25:56,251
ENVIRONMENT AND BE SAFE IF THEY

2395
01:25:56,251 --> 01:25:56,517
REPORT IT.

2396
01:25:56,517 --> 01:25:58,086
THEY WON'T BE RETALIATED AGAINST

2397
01:25:58,086 --> 01:25:59,287
AND THEY'LL BE PROTECTED IF THEY

2398
01:25:59,287 --> 01:26:02,457
REPORT IT AND THAT'S PART OF THE

2399
01:26:02,457 --> 01:26:04,592
STEPS -- OR ONE OF THE STEPS

2400
01:26:04,592 --> 01:26:05,927
THAT'S I THINK BEING IMPROVED AS

2401
01:26:05,927 --> 01:26:11,332
A RESULT OF THE WORKING GROUP,

2402
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:13,868
OR COMMITTEE, THAT CHIEF

2403
01:26:13,868 --> 01:26:16,704
JUSTICES APPOINTED AND I'M

2404
01:26:16,704 --> 01:26:18,906
INTERESTED IN DOING EVERYTHING I

2405
01:26:18,906 --> 01:26:23,111
CAN TO ASSIST THOSE EFFORTS TO

2406
01:26:23,111 --> 01:26:25,380
MAKE THOSE WORKPLACES SAFE.

2407
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:29,083
AGAIN IT'S PART OF A BROADER

2408
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:30,285
NATIONAL PROBLEM, WHETHER IT'S

2409
01:26:30,285 --> 01:26:32,987

BUSINESSPEOPLE, OR NEWS PEOPLE

2412
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:41,696
THERE IS A BROAD NATIONAL

2413
01:26:41,696 --> 01:26:44,766
PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE

2414
01:26:44,766 --> 01:26:49,604
ADDRESSED INCLUDING IN THE

2415
01:26:49,604 --> 01:26:50,538
JUDICIARY.

2416
01:26:50,538 --> 01:26:55,076
I APPLAUD CHIEF JUSTICE FOR

2417
01:26:55,076 --> 01:26:55,376
DOING SO.

2418
01:26:55,443 --> 01:26:55,843
[ CROWD YELLING ]

2419
01:26:55,843 --> 01:26:55,977
.

2420
01:27:14,162 --> 01:27:18,132
>> IF THE LAW IS AMBIGUOUS. 

2421
01:27:18,132 --> 01:27:24,205
SOME OF YOUR WRITINGS EXPRESS 

2422
01:27:24,205 --> 01:27:30,645
SKEPTICISM. BY AVOIDING THE 

2423
01:27:30,645 --> 01:27:32,213
POLITICAL PROCESS -- I CAN 

2424
01:27:32,213 --> 01:27:33,647
UNDERSTAND WHY THIS WOULD BE 

2425
01:27:33,647 --> 01:27:36,884
APPEALING TO AN ADMINISTRATION. 

2426
01:27:36,884 --> 01:27:38,486
BUT I ALSO THINK IT IS A THREAT 

2427
01:27:38,486 --> 01:27:40,088
TO THE SEPARATION OF POWERS. 

2428
01:27:40,088 --> 01:27:44,459
IT TRANSFERS POWER FROM 

2429
01:27:44,459 --> 01:27:47,328
CONGRESS TO THE EXECUTIVE 

2430
01:27:47,328 --> 01:27:48,096
BRANCH. 

2431
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:49,897
THAT'S WHY I'VE ASKED TO 

2432
01:27:49,897 --> 01:27:50,832
REVERSE THAT DOCTRINE. 

2433
01:27:50,832 --> 01:27:55,770
MANY MEMBERS HAVE COSPONSORED 

2434
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:56,170
THIS LEGISLATION. 

2435
01:27:56,170 --> 01:27:57,171
AND AS SOMEONE WHO HAS WRITTEN 

2436
01:27:57,171 --> 01:27:59,841
ABOUT THE SEPARATION OF POWERS, 

2437
01:27:59,841 --> 01:28:01,475
CAN YOU TELL US WHY THE 

2438
01:28:01,475 --> 01:28:09,217
SEPARATION IS SO IMPORTANT AND 

2439
01:28:09,217 --> 01:28:11,185
HOW IT PROTECTS INDIVIDUAL 

2440
01:28:11,185 --> 01:28:11,452
FREEDOM? 

2441
01:28:11,452 --> 01:28:14,255
>> IT PROTECTS INDIVIDUAL 

2442
01:28:14,255 --> 01:28:15,256
LIBERTY. 

2443
01:28:15,256 --> 01:28:18,459
BECAUSE IT RESPONSE TO THE 

2444
01:28:18,459 --> 01:28:21,963
CONCERN THE FRAMERS HAVE THAT 

2445
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:27,268
SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR SAID. 

2446
01:28:27,268 --> 01:28:35,209
IT WILL BE THE DEFINITION OF 

2447
01:28:35,209 --> 01:28:42,983
TYRANNY YOU CAN'T ENFORCE THE 

2448
01:28:42,983 --> 01:28:43,684
LAWS. 

2449
01:28:43,684 --> 01:28:47,155
AND THEN EVEN IF THE LAW IS 

2450
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:49,524
ENFORCED AND A CITIZEN MAY SAY, 

2451
01:28:49,524 --> 01:28:51,058
I WANT SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T PASS 

2452
01:28:51,058 --> 01:28:55,329
A LAW OR ENFORCE IT TO DECIDE 

2453
01:28:55,329 --> 01:28:57,031
IF I VIOLATED THE LAW OR IF IT 

2454
01:28:57,031 --> 01:28:57,565
IS CONSTITUTIONAL. 

2455
01:28:57,565 --> 01:28:59,133
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE AN 

2456
01:28:59,133 --> 01:29:01,369
INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY TO 

2457
01:29:01,369 --> 01:29:03,171
GUARANTEE RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES. 

2458
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:07,074
THE THREE BRANCHES THERE TWO 

2459
01:29:07,074 --> 01:29:07,875
SEPARATE THINGS BECAUSE IT ALL 

2460
01:29:07,875 --> 01:29:13,681
TILTS TOWARDS LIBERTY. 

2461
01:29:13,681 --> 01:29:15,183
IT IS HARD TO PASS A LAW, AS 

2462
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:16,117
YOU KNOW, IN CONGRESS. 

2463
01:29:16,117 --> 01:29:17,785
EVEN IF IT DOES GET PAST A 

2464
01:29:17,785 --> 01:29:24,291
SEPARATE -- PASSED A SEPARATE 

2465
01:29:24,291 --> 01:29:28,730
BODY DOES THAT. 

2466
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:29,830
AND THEN EVEN IF THAT HAPPENS, 

2467
01:29:29,830 --> 01:29:31,265
YOU GO TO COURT AND SAY I 

2468
01:29:31,265 --> 01:29:32,500
DIDN'T VIOLATE THAT LAW AS I'M 

2469
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,268
ACCUSED OR THAT LAW IS 

2470
01:29:34,268 --> 01:29:37,738
UNCONSTITUTIONAL OR THEY ARE 

2471
01:29:37,738 --> 01:29:38,940
INTERPRETING THAT LAW IN A WAY 

2472
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:40,274
THAT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE 

2473
01:29:40,274 --> 01:29:41,576
WAY THE LAW SAYS. 

2474
01:29:41,576 --> 01:29:43,511
THE COURT DECIDES THAT. 

2475
01:29:43,511 --> 01:29:44,445
IT'S NOT THE MEMBERS OF 

2476
01:29:44,445 --> 01:29:47,882
CONGRESS OR THE EXECUTIVE 

2477
01:29:47,882 --> 01:29:48,483
DECIDING THAT. 

2478
01:29:48,483 --> 01:29:49,851
THAT'S HOW THE SEPARATION OF 

2479
01:29:49,851 --> 01:29:52,720
POWERS TILT TOWARDS LIBERTY IN 

2480
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:53,588
ALL RESPECTS. 

2481
01:29:53,588 --> 01:29:55,155
AS TO YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION, 

2482
01:29:55,155 --> 01:29:58,893
SENATOR, ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE 

2483
01:29:58,893 --> 01:30:02,296
SEEN IN MY EXPERIENCE IS A 

2484
01:30:02,296 --> 01:30:07,034
NATURAL TENDENCY, ONE THAT 

2485
01:30:07,034 --> 01:30:08,436
JUDGES NEED TO BE AWARE OF AND 

2486
01:30:08,436 --> 01:30:08,736
RESPOND TO. 

2487
01:30:08,736 --> 01:30:10,738
HERE'S THE NATURAL TENDENCY. 

2488
01:30:10,738 --> 01:30:11,806
CONGRESS PASSES LAWS. 

2489
01:30:11,806 --> 01:30:16,077
BUT THEN THEY CAN'T UPDATE THE 

2490
01:30:16,077 --> 01:30:17,144
LAWS. 

2491
01:30:17,144 --> 01:30:18,378
MAYBE IT IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL 

2492
01:30:18,378 --> 01:30:20,715
LAW OR MAYBE SOME KIND OF LAW 

2493
01:30:20,715 --> 01:30:24,152
DEALING WITH NATIONAL SECURITY. 

2494
01:30:24,152 --> 01:30:25,186
LET'S TAKE THOSE TWO EXAMPLES 

2495
01:30:25,186 --> 01:30:25,686
TO ILLUSTRATE. 

2496
01:30:25,686 --> 01:30:28,389
AND THEN, AN AGENCY WANTS TO DO 

2497
01:30:28,389 --> 01:30:33,528
SOME NEW POLICY AND PROPOSES A 

2498
01:30:33,528 --> 01:30:36,964
NEW POLICY TO CONGRESS. 

2499
01:30:36,964 --> 01:30:37,999
BUT CONGRESS DOESN'T PASS THE 

2500
01:30:37,999 --> 01:30:38,432
NEW POLICY. 

2501
01:30:38,432 --> 01:30:40,835
WHAT OFTEN HAPPENS OR TOO OFTEN 

2502
01:30:40,835 --> 01:30:42,403
I'VE SEEN, THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH 

2503
01:30:42,403 --> 01:30:47,308
THEN RESULTS RELIES ON THE OLD 

2504
01:30:47,308 --> 01:30:48,242
LAW. 

2505
01:30:48,242 --> 01:30:50,044
THE OLD LAW IS AMBIGUOUS. 

2506
01:30:50,044 --> 01:30:51,912
WE CAN FIT THIS NEW POLICY INTO 

2507
01:30:51,912 --> 01:30:56,751
THE OLD LAW AS JUSTIFICATION 

2508
01:30:56,751 --> 01:30:57,652
FOR DOING THIS NEW THING. 

2509
01:30:57,652 --> 01:30:58,986
I HAVE SEEN THIS IN NATIONAL 

2510
01:30:58,986 --> 01:31:00,087
SECURITY CASES, YOU SEE IT ALL 

2511
01:31:00,087 --> 01:31:00,721
OVER THE PLACE. 

2512
01:31:00,721 --> 01:31:02,557
IT IS A NATURAL PHENOMENON. 

2513
01:31:02,557 --> 01:31:04,225
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WANTS TO 

2514
01:31:04,225 --> 01:31:08,563
IMPLEMENT WHAT IT THINKS IS 

2515
01:31:08,563 --> 01:31:09,096
GOOD POLICY. 

2516
01:31:09,096 --> 01:31:10,698
NOW IN THOSE CASES COME TO 

2517
01:31:10,698 --> 01:31:12,133
COURT, IT IS OUR JOB TO FIGURE 

2518
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:16,037
OUT IF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS 

2519
01:31:16,037 --> 01:31:16,971
ACTED WITHIN THE AUTHORITY 

2520
01:31:16,971 --> 01:31:20,608
GIVEN TO IT WITHIN CONGRESS. 

2521
01:31:20,608 --> 01:31:21,942
HAVE YOU GIVEN THEM THE 

2522
01:31:21,942 --> 01:31:24,979
AUTHORITY? 

2523
01:31:24,979 --> 01:31:26,013
IT IS ROOTED IN RESPECT FOR 

2524
01:31:26,013 --> 01:31:26,280
CONGRESS. 

2525
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:28,182
HAVE YOU PASSED THE LAW TO GIVE 

2526
01:31:28,182 --> 01:31:29,650
THE AUTHORITY? 

2527
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:31,285
I HAVE HEARD IT SAID I AM A 

2528
01:31:31,285 --> 01:31:33,120
SKEPTIC OF REGULATION. 

2529
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,522
I AM NOT A SKEPTIC OF 

2530
01:31:34,522 --> 01:31:35,590
REGULATION, AT ALL. 

2531
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:37,391
I'M A SKEPTIC OF UNAUTHORIZED 

2532
01:31:37,391 --> 01:31:39,860
REGULATION. 

2533
01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:41,094
REGULATION THAT IS OUTSIDE THE 

2534
01:31:41,094 --> 01:31:46,100
BONDS OF LOSS BY CONGRESS -- 

2535
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:50,938
LAWS BY CONGRESS. 

2536
01:31:50,938 --> 01:31:52,206
>> OKAY. 

2537
01:31:52,206 --> 01:31:53,540
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT 

2538
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:55,242
QUALITIES I LOOK FOR IN A 

2539
01:31:55,242 --> 01:31:56,777
NOMINEE IS THE ABILITY TO 

2540
01:31:56,777 --> 01:32:01,349
IMPARTIALLY INTERPRET THE LAW. 

2541
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:02,783
AND ALSO APPLY IT TO THE CASE 

2542
01:32:02,783 --> 01:32:03,484
BEFORE THE COURT. 

2543
01:32:03,484 --> 01:32:05,419
NOW THIS CAN OFTEN BE THE MOST 

2544
01:32:05,419 --> 01:32:07,221
DIFFICULT PART OF A JOB. 

2545
01:32:07,221 --> 01:32:08,889
IT MAY REQUIRE THE JUDGE TO 

2546
01:32:08,889 --> 01:32:10,725
RULE AGAINST A LITIGANT THAT 

2547
01:32:10,725 --> 01:32:12,693
COULD BE SYMPATHETIC OR AGAINST 

2548
01:32:12,693 --> 01:32:16,464
A POLICY THAT THE JUDGE MAY 

2549
01:32:16,464 --> 01:32:21,068
PERSONALLY AGREE WITH. 

2550
01:32:21,068 --> 01:32:22,403
SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER COMMENDED 

2551
01:32:22,403 --> 01:32:26,540
HER FOR HEWING CAREFULLY TO THE 

2552
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:30,311
TEXT OF STATUTES EVEN WHEN IT 

2553
01:32:30,311 --> 01:32:31,979
RESULTS IN RULINGS THAT GO 

2554
01:32:31,979 --> 01:32:37,518
AGAINST SYMPATHETIC LITIGANTS. 

2555
01:32:37,518 --> 01:32:38,819
DO YOU BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT 

2556
01:32:38,819 --> 01:32:40,254
FOR A JUDGE TO INTERPRET AND 

2557
01:32:40,254 --> 01:32:41,489
APPLY THE LAWS THAT CONGRESS 

2558
01:32:41,489 --> 01:32:42,290
HAS PASSED RATHER THAN SEEKING 

2559
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:47,294
TO MAKE A CHANGE? 

2560
01:32:47,294 --> 01:32:48,529
IF THE JUDGE DOESN'T LIKE WITH 

2561
01:32:48,529 --> 01:32:49,296
THE CONGRESS HAS DONE? 

2562
01:32:49,296 --> 01:32:50,598
IF SO, WHY OR WHY NOT? 

2563
01:32:50,598 --> 01:32:52,133
>> I AGREE COMPLETELY, SENATOR. 

2564
01:32:52,133 --> 01:32:54,168
THAT'S A FOUNDATION IS THE 

2565
01:32:54,168 --> 01:32:55,836
PROPER JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY. 

2566
01:32:55,836 --> 01:32:56,637
>> OKAY. 

2567
01:32:56,637 --> 01:33:01,475
>> THE SYSTEM YOU DESCRIBED, WE 

2568
01:33:01,475 --> 01:33:02,877
HAVE TO STICK TO THE LAWS 

2569
01:33:02,877 --> 01:33:03,310
PASSED BY CONGRESS. 

2570
01:33:03,310 --> 01:33:05,980
YOU MAKE THE POLICY. 

2571
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:08,449
WE'LL FOLLOW THE POLICY 

2572
01:33:08,449 --> 01:33:09,483
DIRECTION THAT YOU PUT INTO THE 

2573
01:33:09,483 --> 01:33:12,253
LOSS THAT ARE ENACTED, PAST BY 

2574
01:33:12,253 --> 01:33:13,454
THE HOUSE AND SENATE AND SIGNED 

2575
01:33:13,454 --> 01:33:13,887
BY THE PRESIDENT. 

2576
01:33:13,887 --> 01:33:17,892
WE DON'T RELATE -- REWRITE 

2577
01:33:17,892 --> 01:33:19,927
THOSE LAWS. 

2578
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:23,564
>> OKAY. SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES 

2579
01:33:23,564 --> 01:33:25,132
HAVE CRITICIZED YOU FOR RULING 

2580
01:33:25,132 --> 01:33:27,267
TOO OFTEN AGAINST ENVIRONMENTAL 

2581
01:33:27,267 --> 01:33:28,736
INTEREST. 

2582
01:33:28,736 --> 01:33:31,205
IT SEEMS MANY OF THESE 

2583
01:33:31,205 --> 01:33:32,239
CIRCUMSTANCES BOIL DOWN TO THE 

2584
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:33,874
FACT THAT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES 

2585
01:33:33,874 --> 01:33:35,209
DON'T LIKE THE LAWS THAT 

2586
01:33:35,209 --> 01:33:37,611
CONGRESS HAS PASSED AND ARE 

2587
01:33:37,611 --> 01:33:38,346
FRUSTRATED THEY HAVEN'T BEEN 

2588
01:33:38,346 --> 01:33:39,446
ABLE TO GET THEIR OWN POLICIES 

2589
01:33:39,446 --> 01:33:40,881
SIGNED INTO LAW. 

2590
01:33:40,881 --> 01:33:42,817
I'VE LOOK THROUGH YOUR RECORD. 

2591
01:33:42,817 --> 01:33:44,452
AND I FOUND THAT YOU HAVE NOT 

2592
01:33:44,452 --> 01:33:47,188
HESITATED AT ALL TO UPHOLD 

2593
01:33:47,188 --> 01:33:48,889
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS WHEN 

2594
01:33:48,889 --> 01:33:55,229
THEY WERE ACTUALLY AUTHORIZED 

2595
01:33:55,229 --> 01:33:57,064
BY STATUTE. 

2596
01:33:57,064 --> 01:33:58,165
COULD YOU GIVE US A FEW 

2597
01:33:58,165 --> 01:33:59,200
EXAMPLES OF CASES WHERE YOU 

2598
01:33:59,200 --> 01:33:59,934
HAVE UPHELD ENVIRONMENTAL 

2599
01:33:59,934 --> 01:34:00,601
REGULATIONS BECAUSE YOU 

2600
01:34:00,601 --> 01:34:01,969
CONCLUDED THAT CONGRESS HAS 

2601
01:34:01,969 --> 01:34:02,369
AUTHORIZED THEM? 

2602
01:34:02,369 --> 01:34:06,673
>> LIMIT IT TO AS MANY AS YOU 

2603
01:34:06,673 --> 01:34:11,545
CAN BECAUSE OF TIME. 

2604
01:34:11,545 --> 01:34:12,580
>> SENATOR, AS I SAID 

2605
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:14,448
YESTERDAY, I'M APRIL LAW JUDGE. 

2606
01:34:14,448 --> 01:34:17,017
IN ENVIRONMENTAL CASES -- APRIL 

2607
01:34:17,017 --> 01:34:17,785
LAW JUDGE. 

2608
01:34:17,785 --> 01:34:22,223
IN MANY CASES I HAVE VOTED FOR 

2609
01:34:22,223 --> 01:34:25,292
ENVIRONMENTAL INTEREST. 

2610
01:34:25,292 --> 01:34:27,595
I UPHELD A CALIFORNIA 

2611
01:34:27,595 --> 01:34:29,630
REGULATION FOR MATURITY OVER A 

2612
01:34:29,630 --> 01:34:32,500
DISSENT, STRICTER AIR QUALITY 

2613
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:34,869
STANDARDS IN THE NATIONAL 

2614
01:34:34,869 --> 01:34:37,738
ASSOCIATIONS CASE. 

2615
01:34:37,738 --> 01:34:40,374
EPA RULES FOR PARTICULATE MATTER

2616
01:34:40,374 --> 01:34:45,212
. PERMIT PROCESSOR FOR SURFACE 

2617
01:34:45,212 --> 01:34:49,750
COAL MINING. THE ENERGY CASE, 

2618
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:51,318
REJECTING A PREMATURE CHALLENGE 

2619
01:34:51,318 --> 01:34:54,988
TO A CLEAN POWERPLANT 

2620
01:34:54,988 --> 01:34:56,423
REGULATION. 

2621
01:34:56,423 --> 01:35:02,997
THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE 

2622
01:35:02,997 --> 01:35:06,634
CASE AGAINST THE EPA. 

2623
01:35:06,634 --> 01:35:08,569
THAT WAS A BIG-MONEY CASE WHERE 

2624
01:35:08,569 --> 01:35:11,305
THE INDUSTRY WANTED AN 

2625
01:35:11,305 --> 01:35:16,043
CONFRONTATIVE DEFENSE TO BE 

2626
01:35:16,043 --> 01:35:16,309
CREATED. 

2627
01:35:16,309 --> 01:35:17,178
THE DEFENSE WAS NOT IN THE 

2628
01:35:17,178 --> 01:35:20,414
STATUTES PASSED BY CONGRESS. 

2629
01:35:20,414 --> 01:35:21,615
THE INDUSTRY CAME IN WITH THEIR 

2630
01:35:21,615 --> 01:35:22,650
LAWYERS AND SAID JUST RIGHT JOB 

2631
01:35:22,650 --> 01:35:24,218
THE DEFENSE INTO THE LAW. 

2632
01:35:24,218 --> 01:35:29,790
-- WRITE THAT INTO THE LAW. 

2633
01:35:29,790 --> 01:35:29,990
NO. 

2634
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:31,125
THAT'S NOT IN THE LAW. 

2635
01:35:31,125 --> 01:35:34,461
WE FOLLOW THE LAW REGARDLESS. 

2636
01:35:34,461 --> 01:35:35,763
THERE ARE LARGE NUMBER OF CASES 

2637
01:35:35,763 --> 01:35:37,965
WHERE I'VE RULED IN FAVOR OF 

2638
01:35:37,965 --> 01:35:39,400
ENVIRONMENTALIST INTERESTS 

2639
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:42,203
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE LAW 

2640
01:35:42,203 --> 01:35:43,671
REQUIRED IN THAT CASE. 

2641
01:35:43,671 --> 01:35:44,971
>> JUDGE, I PERSONALLY -- 

2642
01:35:44,971 --> 01:35:47,140
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR. 

2643
01:35:47,140 --> 01:35:57,585
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

2644
01:35:57,585 --> 01:35:58,285
>> THANK YOU. 

2645
01:35:58,285 --> 01:35:59,619
>> WE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS. 

2646
01:35:59,619 --> 01:36:01,021
YOU HAVE DONE A LOT OF 

2647
01:36:01,021 --> 01:36:02,155
PREPARATION WITH A COUPLE 

2648
01:36:02,155 --> 01:36:03,924
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES ABOUT THE 

2649
01:36:03,924 --> 01:36:04,925
QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT BE ASKED. 

2650
01:36:04,925 --> 01:36:07,961
BUT LET ME ASK YOU, SOMETHING 

2651
01:36:07,961 --> 01:36:10,364
THAT NORMALLY ISN'T AN ISSUE 

2652
01:36:10,364 --> 01:36:12,767
DURING THE SUPREME COURT 

2653
01:36:12,767 --> 01:36:13,267
HEARINGS. 

2654
01:36:13,267 --> 01:36:15,169
YOU TESTIFIED BEFORE THIS 

2655
01:36:15,169 --> 01:36:19,940
COMMITTEE IN BOTH 2004 AND 2006 

2656
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:21,742
AS PART OF YOUR NOMINATION TO 

2657
01:36:21,742 --> 01:36:28,482
THE D.C. CIRCUIT COURT. 

2658
01:36:28,482 --> 01:36:29,383
AND YOU WERE NICE ENOUGH TO 

2659
01:36:29,383 --> 01:36:35,356
COME BY MY OFFICE AND CHAT WITH 

2660
01:36:35,356 --> 01:36:35,723
ME LAST MONTH. 

2661
01:36:35,723 --> 01:36:36,256
I ASKED YOU IF YOU CHANGE 

2662
01:36:36,256 --> 01:36:40,294
ANYTHING IN YOUR PRIOR TESTIMONY

2663
01:36:40,294 --> 01:36:40,861
. YOU SAID NO. 

2664
01:36:40,861 --> 01:36:41,996
IS THAT STILL YOUR POSITION? 

2665
01:36:41,996 --> 01:36:44,031
>> IT IS, SENATOR. 

2666
01:36:44,031 --> 01:36:45,232
I TOLD THE TRUTH. 

2667
01:36:45,232 --> 01:36:51,505
>> NO, NO, NO. 

2668
01:36:51,505 --> 01:36:52,640
I'M JUST ASKING IF YOU WOULD 

2669
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:53,140
CHANGE ANYTHING? 

2670
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:54,675
>> I WOULD LIKE TO EXPAND IF I 

2671
01:36:54,675 --> 01:36:54,875
CAN. 

2672
01:36:54,875 --> 01:36:56,277
>> I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A 

2673
01:36:56,277 --> 01:36:56,510
CHANCE. 

2674
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:57,311
GO AHEAD. 

2675
01:36:57,311 --> 01:37:00,848
>> I JUST WANTED TO EXPLAIN THAT

2676
01:37:00,848 --> 01:37:03,217
AT THE LAST HEARING IN 2006 IN 

2677
01:37:03,217 --> 01:37:07,054
PARTICULAR, YOU WERE CONCERNED, 

2678
01:37:07,054 --> 01:37:08,289
UNDERSTANDABLY, THERE HAD BEEN 

2679
01:37:08,289 --> 01:37:09,723
TWO NOMINEES WHO HAD BEEN 

2680
01:37:09,723 --> 01:37:13,327
INVOLVED IN THE LEGAL MEMOS AND 

2681
01:37:13,327 --> 01:37:15,428
DISCUSSIONS AROUND CRAFTING THE 

2682
01:37:15,428 --> 01:37:19,266
ENHANCED DETENTION POLICIES. 

2683
01:37:19,266 --> 01:37:22,303
YOU ARE CONCERNED IF I ALSO WAS 

2684
01:37:22,303 --> 01:37:22,736
INVOLVED IN THOSE. 

2685
01:37:22,736 --> 01:37:26,740
AND I MADE CLEAR IN RESPONSE TO 

2686
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:29,710
THOSE QUESTIONS THAT WAS NOT IN 

2687
01:37:29,710 --> 01:37:30,411
THAT PROGRAM. 

2688
01:37:30,411 --> 01:37:31,011
THAT WAS 100% ACCURATE. 

2689
01:37:31,011 --> 01:37:33,247
IT IS STILL ACCURATE TODAY. 

2690
01:37:33,247 --> 01:37:35,783
I THINK THE REPORT ESTABLISHED 

2691
01:37:35,783 --> 01:37:38,886
THAT I WAS NOT INVOLVED IN 

2692
01:37:38,886 --> 01:37:39,954
THOSE PROGRAMS. 

2693
01:37:39,954 --> 01:37:41,588
THERE WERE TWO NOMINEES. 

2694
01:37:41,588 --> 01:37:45,793
>> I'M GOING TO GO INTO THAT IN 

2695
01:37:45,793 --> 01:37:46,193
A BIT. 

2696
01:37:46,193 --> 01:37:48,262
I DON'T WANT TO GO OVER MY TIME 

2697
01:37:48,262 --> 01:37:50,865
AS THE PRECEDING SENATOR DID. 

2698
01:37:50,865 --> 01:37:52,933
I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR AND 

2699
01:37:52,933 --> 01:37:55,536
REASSURE YOU. 

2700
01:37:55,536 --> 01:37:57,705
>> I'M GOING TO GO INTO THAT. 

2701
01:37:57,705 --> 01:38:00,975
>> LET ME. 

2702
01:38:00,975 --> 01:38:02,743
>> I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE TIME 

2703
01:38:02,743 --> 01:38:04,111
AWAY. 

2704
01:38:04,111 --> 01:38:05,512
>> LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING. 

2705
01:38:05,512 --> 01:38:07,314
IF IT QUESTION IS ASKED WITHIN 

2706
01:38:07,314 --> 01:38:10,584
THE 30 MINUTES, HE CAN FINISH 

2707
01:38:10,584 --> 01:38:13,587
THE QUESTION AND IT CAN BE 

2708
01:38:13,587 --> 01:38:13,853
ANSWERED. 

2709
01:38:13,853 --> 01:38:19,493
SO, HE DID NOT GO OVER HIS TIME.

2710
01:38:19,493 --> 01:38:21,028
>> SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO HIT 

2711
01:38:21,028 --> 01:38:21,628
A SENSITIVE AREA. 

2712
01:38:21,628 --> 01:38:22,863
LET ME ASK YOU THIS. 

2713
01:38:22,863 --> 01:38:26,467
BETWEEN 2001 -- I'M NEW HERE. 

2714
01:38:26,467 --> 01:38:31,571
[ LAUGHTER ] BETWEEN 2001 AND 

2715
01:38:31,571 --> 01:38:34,808
2003, TWO REPUBLICAN STAFFERS 

2716
01:38:34,808 --> 01:38:37,444
ON THIS COMMITTEE HACKED INTO 

2717
01:38:37,444 --> 01:38:41,315
THE PRIVATE COMPUTER FILES OF 

2718
01:38:41,315 --> 01:38:43,283
SIX SENATORS INCLUDING MINE. 

2719
01:38:43,283 --> 01:38:44,651
THESE REPUBLICAN STAFFERS 

2720
01:38:44,651 --> 01:38:51,458
STALLED -- STOLE FILES AND USE 

2721
01:38:51,458 --> 01:38:53,694
THEM TO ASSIST IN GETTING 

2722
01:38:53,694 --> 01:39:01,267
PRESIDENT BUSH'S MOST -- 

2723
01:39:01,267 --> 01:39:03,237
CONFIRMED. 

2724
01:39:03,237 --> 01:39:05,172
IT BECAME PUBLIC IN LATE 2003. 

2725
01:39:05,172 --> 01:39:07,908
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL PRINTED 

2726
01:39:07,908 --> 01:39:09,443
SOME OF THE STOLEN MATERIALS. 

2727
01:39:09,443 --> 01:39:11,445
THE RINGLEADER BEHIND THIS THEFT

2728
01:39:11,445 --> 01:39:17,151
WAS A REPUBLICAN STAFFER WHO 

2729
01:39:17,151 --> 01:39:18,285
WOULD WORK FOR ONE OF THE 

2730
01:39:18,285 --> 01:39:23,157
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. 

2731
01:39:23,157 --> 01:39:26,493
IT WAS CONSIDERED AS A DIGITAL 

2732
01:39:26,493 --> 01:39:30,697
WATERGATE AND A THEFT NOT 

2733
01:39:30,697 --> 01:39:34,101
UNLIKE WHAT THE RUSSIANS DID. 

2734
01:39:34,101 --> 01:39:36,136
DURING ALL THIS YOU WORKED HAND 

2735
01:39:36,136 --> 01:39:42,276
IN HAND IN THE WHITE HOUSE WITH 

2736
01:39:42,276 --> 01:39:44,411
MANNY MIRANDA.  

2737
01:39:44,411 --> 01:39:48,148
NOT SURPRISINGLY, YOU WERE 

2738
01:39:48,148 --> 01:39:49,349
ASKED EXTENSIVELY ABOUT YOUR 

2739
01:39:49,349 --> 01:39:52,285
KNOWLEDGE OF THIS THEFT DURING 

2740
01:39:52,285 --> 01:39:56,323
BOTH YOUR 2004 AND 2006 

2741
01:39:56,323 --> 01:39:57,958
HEARINGS. 

2742
01:39:57,958 --> 01:40:00,694
I DON'T USE THE WORD 

2743
01:40:00,694 --> 01:40:01,562
EXTENSIVELY LIGHTLY. 

2744
01:40:01,562 --> 01:40:05,165
YOU ARE ASKED OVER 100 QUESTIONS

2745
01:40:05,165 --> 01:40:06,467
FROM SENATORS. 

2746
01:40:06,467 --> 01:40:12,706
AND YOU TESTIFIED REPEATEDLY 

2747
01:40:12,706 --> 01:40:13,707
THAT YOU NEVER RECEIVED ANY 

2748
01:40:13,707 --> 01:40:14,341
STOLEN MATERIALS. 

2749
01:40:14,341 --> 01:40:17,244
YOU KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT UNTIL 

2750
01:40:17,244 --> 01:40:20,581
IT WAS PUBLIC. 

2751
01:40:20,581 --> 01:40:21,648
YOU TESTIFIED IF YOU HAD 

2752
01:40:21,648 --> 01:40:22,349
SUSPECTED ANYTHING, YOU WOULD 

2753
01:40:22,349 --> 01:40:25,419
HAVE REPORTED IT TO THE COUNCIL.

2754
01:40:25,419 --> 01:40:27,287
THEY WOULD'VE RAISE THAT WITH 

2755
01:40:27,287 --> 01:40:28,722
SENATOR HATCH. 

2756
01:40:28,722 --> 01:40:31,125
AT THE TIME, WE LEFT IT THERE. 

2757
01:40:31,125 --> 01:40:32,525
WE DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER. 

2758
01:40:32,525 --> 01:40:35,295
TODAY, WITH A VERY LIMITED 

2759
01:40:35,295 --> 01:40:40,667
AMOUNT OF YOUR RECORD, AND IT 

2760
01:40:40,667 --> 01:40:42,803
IS LIMITED, FOR THE FIRST TIME, 

2761
01:40:42,803 --> 01:40:44,171
WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LEARN 

2762
01:40:44,171 --> 01:40:45,372
ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH 

2763
01:40:45,372 --> 01:40:46,440
MR. MIRANDA AND YOUR KNOWLEDGE 

2764
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:49,476
OF THESE EVENTS. 

2765
01:40:49,476 --> 01:40:53,146
SO MY QUESTION IS THIS, DID MR. 

2766
01:40:53,146 --> 01:40:57,918
MIRANDA EVER PROVIDE YOU WITH 

2767
01:40:57,918 --> 01:40:58,952
HIGHLY SPECIFIC INFORMATION 

2768
01:40:58,952 --> 01:41:01,622
REGARDING WHAT I OR OTHER 

2769
01:41:01,622 --> 01:41:04,291
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS ARE 

2770
01:41:04,291 --> 01:41:09,096
PLANNING TO ASK TO CERTAIN 

2771
01:41:09,096 --> 01:41:09,362
NOMINEES? 

2772
01:41:09,362 --> 01:41:12,065
>> SENATOR, LET ME CONTEXTUALIZE

2773
01:41:12,065 --> 01:41:13,233
AS I'M LOOKING AT WHAT YOU'RE 

2774
01:41:13,233 --> 01:41:14,768
ú 

2775
01:41:14,768 --> 01:41:19,840
-- PUTTING UP HERE FIRST. 

2776
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,575
>> THE QUESTION IS -- 

2777
01:41:21,575 --> 01:41:24,645
>> WHAT IS UP THERE, IS 100% 

2778
01:41:24,645 --> 01:41:28,081
ACCURATE. 

2779
01:41:28,081 --> 01:41:30,684
AS TO MY MEMORY. 

2780
01:41:30,684 --> 01:41:31,018
>> OKAY. 

2781
01:41:31,018 --> 01:41:32,352
LET ME ASK YOU THIS. 

2782
01:41:32,352 --> 01:41:33,920
>> I NEVER KNEW OR SUSPECTED. 

2783
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:35,189
TRUE. 

2784
01:41:35,189 --> 01:41:36,522
NEVER SUSPECTED ANYTHING. 

2785
01:41:36,522 --> 01:41:37,658
TRUE. 

2786
01:41:37,658 --> 01:41:41,595
HAD I SUSPECTED THINKING 

2787
01:41:41,595 --> 01:41:43,063
ANYTHING, I WOULD'VE TALK TO 

2788
01:41:43,063 --> 01:41:45,065
THE JUDGE. 

2789
01:41:45,065 --> 01:41:45,766
THAT'S ALL 100% TRUE. 

2790
01:41:45,766 --> 01:41:47,534
>> AND THAT'S WHAT I ALREADY 

2791
01:41:47,534 --> 01:41:48,502
SAID. 

2792
01:41:48,502 --> 01:41:51,805
BUT DID MR. MIRANDA EVER 

2793
01:41:51,805 --> 01:41:54,208
PROVIDE YOU WITH HIGHLY 

2794
01:41:54,208 --> 01:41:56,910
SPECIFIC INFORMATION REGARDING 

2795
01:41:56,910 --> 01:41:59,079
WHAT I OR OTHER DEMOCRATIC 

2796
01:41:59,079 --> 01:42:05,018
SENATORS ARE PLANNING IN THE 

2797
01:42:05,018 --> 01:42:06,586
FUTURE TO ASK CERTAIN NOMINEES? 

2798
01:42:06,586 --> 01:42:09,756
>> ONE OF THE THINGS WE WOULD 

2799
01:42:09,756 --> 01:42:12,592
DO AS A WHITE HOUSE IS ON 

2800
01:42:12,592 --> 01:42:15,129
NOMINATIONS -- AND COMING TO 

2801
01:42:15,129 --> 01:42:16,663
YOUR ANSWER BUT I WANT TO 

2802
01:42:16,663 --> 01:42:19,800
EXPLAIN, IS TO MEET A.. 

2803
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:23,503
AND THIS HAPPENS ON -- MEET UP 

2804
01:42:23,503 --> 01:42:23,703
HERE. 

2805
01:42:23,703 --> 01:42:25,873
AND THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. 

2806
01:42:25,873 --> 01:42:30,210
THEY ARE COMING UP. HOW ARE WE 

2807
01:42:30,210 --> 01:42:31,244
GOING TO GET THEM THROUGH. 

2808
01:42:31,244 --> 01:42:35,315
HERE'S A HEARING COMING UP. 

2809
01:42:35,315 --> 01:42:36,416
AND DURING THOSE MEETINGS, OF 

2810
01:42:36,416 --> 01:42:38,252
COURSE, IT WOULD BE DISCUSSED. 

2811
01:42:38,252 --> 01:42:39,353
HERE IS WHAT SENATOR LEAHY IS 

2812
01:42:39,353 --> 01:42:42,856
GOING TO BE  INTERESTED IN. 

2813
01:42:42,856 --> 01:42:49,463
THAT'S VERY, -- VERY COMMON. 

2814
01:42:49,463 --> 01:42:50,364
I THINK THIS IS WHAT SENATOR 

2815
01:42:50,364 --> 01:42:51,598
GRAHAM WILL BE INTERESTED IN. 

2816
01:42:51,598 --> 01:42:53,132
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO IN MEETINGS 

2817
01:42:53,132 --> 01:42:57,638
WITH -- HIGHLY SPECIFIC WOULD 

2818
01:42:57,638 --> 01:42:59,072
-- I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU'RE 

2819
01:42:59,072 --> 01:43:00,574
GETTING AT. 

2820
01:43:00,574 --> 01:43:02,509
>> I HAVE BEEN HERE OVER 40 

2821
01:43:02,509 --> 01:43:02,742
YEARS. 

2822
01:43:02,742 --> 01:43:06,380
I KNOW WHAT BOTH 

2823
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:06,880
ADMINISTRATIONS DO IN 

2824
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:07,180
PREPARING. 

2825
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:08,448
I'M NOT ASKING ABOUT THAT. 

2826
01:43:08,448 --> 01:43:11,051
I'M ASKING YOU WHY BEFORE THIS 

2827
01:43:11,051 --> 01:43:13,487
DID MR. MIRANDA SEND YOU AN 

2828
01:43:13,487 --> 01:43:17,190

2829

2002, ASKING YOU AND ANOTHER 

2830
01:43:21,194 --> 01:43:25,699
BUSH OFFICIAL WHY THE LEAHY 

2831
01:43:25,699 --> 01:43:26,500
PEOPLE WERE LOOKING INTO 

2832
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:28,902
FINANCIAL TIES  BETWEEN TWO 

2833
01:43:28,902 --> 01:43:31,738
SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS AND 

2834
01:43:31,738 --> 01:43:40,514
PRISCILLA OWN -- OWEN. 

2835
01:43:40,514 --> 01:43:42,548
SHE HAD RECEIVED A LOT OF 

2836
01:43:42,548 --> 01:43:45,552
CONTRIBUTIONS. 

2837
01:43:45,552 --> 01:43:50,490
DID MR. MIRANDA SEND YOU AN 

2838
01:43:50,490 --> 01:43:55,762
EMAIL ASKING YOU WHY THE LEAHY 

2839
01:43:55,762 --> 01:43:57,231
WERE LOOKING INTO HER FINANCIAL 

2840
01:43:57,231 --> 01:43:58,932
TIES?  

2841
01:43:58,932 --> 01:44:01,067
>> IS THAT WHAT THIS EMAIL IS? 

2842
01:44:01,067 --> 01:44:03,804
>> I'M JUST ASKING YOU. 

2843
01:44:03,804 --> 01:44:07,941
>> CAN I TAKE A MINUTE TO READ 

2844
01:44:07,941 --> 01:44:08,141
THIS? 

2845
01:44:08,141 --> 01:44:09,309
>> OF COURSE. 

2846
01:44:09,309 --> 01:44:10,777
>> OKAY. 

2847
01:44:14,581 --> 01:44:17,684
>> AND THIS WAS FOUR DAYS 

2848
01:44:17,684 --> 01:44:20,520
BEFORE THE HEARING ON JULY 23. 

2849
01:44:32,632 --> 01:44:35,969
>> DID I SEND ANY OF THE EMAILS 

2850
01:44:35,969 --> 01:44:36,603
ON THIS CHAIN? 

2851
01:44:36,603 --> 01:44:41,641
I DON'T THINK SO. 

2852
01:44:41,641 --> 01:44:48,181
I THINK I AM CC'ED. 

2853
01:44:48,181 --> 01:44:55,255
IN ANY EVENT, IF YOU SAID WHY 

2854
01:44:55,255 --> 01:44:56,590
ARE THE LEAHY PEOPLE LOOKING 

2855
01:44:56,590 --> 01:45:00,494
INTO THIS,  FROM MANNY MIRANDA  

2856
01:45:00,494 --> 01:45:04,731
-- I DON'T REALLY HAVE A

THIS, SENATOR. 

2859
01:45:08,301 --> 01:45:10,137
IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AT ALL 

2860
01:45:10,137 --> 01:45:11,805
UNUSUAL FOR -- AND THIS HAPPENS 

2861
01:45:11,805 --> 01:45:13,240
ALL THE TIME, I THINK. 

2862
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:14,541
THE LEAHY PEOPLE LOOKING INTO 

2863
01:45:14,541 --> 01:45:15,976
THIS  AND THE HATCH PEOPLE ARE 

2864
01:45:15,976 --> 01:45:16,376
LOOK INTO THAT. 

2865
01:45:16,376 --> 01:45:17,277
I THINK. 

2866
01:45:17,277 --> 01:45:22,082
>> YOU SAY ALL THE TIME BUT TWO 

2867
01:45:22,082 --> 01:45:23,483
DAYS BEFORE THE HEARING THEY

TOLD YOU THE DEMOCRATS WERE 

2869
01:45:24,951 --> 01:45:27,721
PASSING AROUND A STORY SAYING 

2870
01:45:27,721 --> 01:45:30,023
IT IS INTEL. 

2871
01:45:30,023 --> 01:45:31,458
SUGGESTING THAT LEAHY  WILL 

2872
01:45:31,458 --> 01:45:32,959
FOCUS ON ALL THINGS MONEY. 

2873
01:45:32,959 --> 01:45:37,130
WELL, THAT APPEARS TO COME FROM 

2874
01:45:37,130 --> 01:45:42,135
A STOLEN EMAIL TO ME, STOLEN BY 

2875
01:45:42,135 --> 01:45:44,404

2876
01:45:44,404 --> 01:45:48,074
NIGHT BEFORE AND THEN GIVEN TO 

2877

GETTING STOLEN EMAILS? 

2880
01:45:55,882 --> 01:45:58,218
>> NOT AT ALL, SENATOR. 

2881
01:45:58,218 --> 01:46:00,053

IN THIS PROCESS, IT IS, TO HEAR

NIGHT BEFORE. 

2903

HAVE THAT IN LESS HE STOLE IT. 

2905
01:46:46,700 --> 01:46:47,801

01:47:40,786 --> 01:47:41,321
DASCHLE. 

2923
01:47:41,321 --> 01:47:45,091
THE LETTER WAS CLEARLY A DRAFT. 

2924
01:47:45,091 --> 01:47:47,027
IT HAD TYPOS. 

2925
01:47:47,027 --> 01:47:49,062
AND IT WAS NOT SIGNED. 

2926
01:47:49,062 --> 01:47:51,331
SOMEBODY EVENTUALLY -- WE NEVER 

2927
01:47:51,331 --> 01:47:53,467
PUT IT OUT BUT SOMEBODY 

2928
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:55,301
EVENTUALLY LEAKED IT TO FOX 

2929
01:47:55,301 --> 01:47:55,869
NEWS. 

2930
01:47:55,869 --> 01:47:59,806
I'M NOT SURE WHO, I COULD GUESS.

2931
01:47:59,806 --> 01:48:04,377
IT WAS A PRIVATE LETTER. 

2932
01:48:04,377 --> 01:48:05,779
I WAS SHOCKED TO LEARN THAT IT 

2933
01:48:05,779 --> 01:48:06,780
EXISTED AT THE TIME. 

2934
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:09,749
IT HAD BEEN LEAKED. 

2935
01:48:09,749 --> 01:48:10,450
HERE'S THE THING. 

2936
01:48:10,450 --> 01:48:12,252
YOU HAD THE FULL TEXT IN YOUR 

2937
01:48:12,252 --> 01:48:14,688
INBOX BEFORE ANYTHING HAD BEEN 

2938
01:48:14,688 --> 01:48:16,790
SAID ABOUT IT PUBLICLY. 

2939
01:48:16,790 --> 01:48:20,760
DID YOU FIND IT AT ALL UNUSUAL 

2940
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:22,629
TO RECEIVE A DRAFT LETTER FROM 

2941
01:48:22,629 --> 01:48:24,197
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS TO EACH 

2942
01:48:24,197 --> 01:48:26,500
OTHER BEFORE ANY MENTION OF IT 

2943
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:28,101
WAS MADE PUBLIC? 

2944
01:48:28,101 --> 01:48:32,572
>> THE ONLY THING I SAID ON THE 

2945
01:48:32,572 --> 01:48:33,406
EMAIL EXCHANGE IF I'M LOOKING 

2946
01:48:33,406 --> 01:48:34,975
AT QUICKLY, SENATOR, WAS WHO 

2947
01:48:34,975 --> 01:48:36,443
SIGNED THIS. 

2948
01:48:36,443 --> 01:48:37,477
WHICH WOULD IMPLY THAT I 

2949
01:48:37,477 --> 01:48:41,848
THOUGHT IT WAS A SIGNED LETTER. 

2950
01:48:41,848 --> 01:48:46,319
>> WERE YOU SURPRISED TO GET IT?

2951
01:48:46,319 --> 01:48:47,220
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A DRAFT. 

2952
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:48,355
IT HAS TYPOS AND EVERYTHING 

2953
01:48:48,355 --> 01:48:48,555
ELSE. 

2954
01:48:48,555 --> 01:48:50,423
WERE YOU SURPRISED THAT THE 

2955
01:48:50,423 --> 01:48:53,660
DRAFT LETTER CIRCULATED AMONG 

2956
01:48:53,660 --> 01:48:56,496
DEMOCRATS AND ENDED UP IN YOUR 

2957
01:48:56,496 --> 01:48:58,365
INBOX? 

2958
01:48:58,365 --> 01:49:02,502
>> BUT I -- I THINK THE PREMISE 

2959
01:49:02,502 --> 01:49:03,670
OF YOUR QUESTION IS NOT 

2960
01:49:03,670 --> 01:49:06,873
ACCURATELY DESCRIBING MY 

2961
01:49:06,873 --> 01:49:08,842
APPARENT RECOLLECTION OR 

2962
01:49:08,842 --> 01:49:10,577
UNDERSTANDING AT THE TIME. 

2963
01:49:10,577 --> 01:49:12,078
I WOULDN'T HAVE SAID WHO SIGNED 

2964
01:49:12,078 --> 01:49:16,082
THIS IF I THOUGHT IT WAS A 

2965
01:49:16,082 --> 01:49:16,315
DRAFT. 

2966
01:49:16,315 --> 01:49:19,519
MY EMAIL SAYS WHO SIGNED THIS. 

2967
01:49:19,519 --> 01:49:20,854
>> SO YOU DIDN'T REALIZE WHAT 

2968
01:49:20,854 --> 01:49:22,522
YOU HAD WAS A STOLEN LETTER 

2969
01:49:22,522 --> 01:49:27,794
SIGNED BY ME? 

2970
01:49:27,794 --> 01:49:29,796
YOU HAD A LETTER THAT HAD BEEN 

2971
01:49:29,796 --> 01:49:31,131
NOT SENT TO ANYBODY NOT BEEN 

2972
01:49:31,131 --> 01:49:31,998
MADE PUBLIC? 

2973
01:49:31,998 --> 01:49:35,201
>> ALL I SEE THAT I SAID WAS 

2974
01:49:35,201 --> 01:49:37,804
WHO SIGNED THIS. 

2975
01:49:37,804 --> 01:49:39,839
THAT'S ALL I SEE. 

2976
01:49:39,839 --> 01:49:41,474
>> LET ME ASK YOU SOME MORE. 

2977
01:49:41,474 --> 01:49:44,477
SO MUCH OF THIS CAME FROM MR. 

2978
01:49:44,477 --> 01:49:49,115
MIRANDA. 

2979
01:49:49,115 --> 01:49:53,119
HE WAS A REPUBLICAN STAFFER WHO 

2980
01:49:53,119 --> 01:49:54,721
WAS STEALING THINGS AS WE DON'T 

2981
01:49:54,721 --> 01:49:55,488
KNOW. 

2982
01:49:55,488 --> 01:49:57,957
DID HE EVER ASK TO MEET 

2983
01:49:57,957 --> 01:50:06,600
PRIVATELY WITH YOU AT AN OFF 

2984
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:07,300
SITE LOCATION OTHER THAN THE 

2985
01:50:07,300 --> 01:50:08,501
WHITE HOUSE OR CAPITOL HILL? 

2986
01:50:08,501 --> 01:50:09,936
>> I THINK SOMETIMES, SENATOR, 

2987
01:50:09,936 --> 01:50:11,271
THE MEETINGS WITH SENATE 

2988
01:50:11,271 --> 01:50:14,574
STAFFERS AND -- 

2989
01:50:14,574 --> 01:50:15,675
>> I'M JUST ASKING ABOUT ONE 

2990
01:50:15,675 --> 01:50:16,743
PARTICULAR ONE. 

2991
01:50:16,743 --> 01:50:17,076
MR. MIRANDA. 

2992
01:50:17,076 --> 01:50:19,846
>> USUALLY IT WOULD BE AT THE 

2993
01:50:19,846 --> 01:50:21,181
WHITE HOUSE OR THE SENATE BUT 

2994
01:50:21,181 --> 01:50:22,482
SOMETIMES I THINK WE WOULD MEET 

2995
01:50:22,482 --> 01:50:25,952
-- OR AT THE DOJ. BUT SOMETIMES 

2996
01:50:25,952 --> 01:50:27,220
IT COULD BE SOMEWHERE ELSE. 

2997
01:50:27,220 --> 01:50:29,622
>> DID HE HAS TO MEET WITH YOU 

2998
01:50:29,622 --> 01:50:30,857
PRIVATELY SO HE COULD GIVE YOU 

2999
01:50:30,857 --> 01:50:31,758
INFORMATION PRIVATELY SO HE 

3000
01:50:31,758 --> 01:50:32,491
COULD GIVE YOU INFORMATION 

3001
01:50:32,491 --> 01:50:35,829
ABOUT SENATOR BIDEN OR SENATOR 

3002
01:50:35,829 --> 01:50:36,129
FEINSTEIN? 

3003
01:50:36,129 --> 01:50:40,400
>> I'M NOT REMEMBER  -- 

3004
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:41,201
REMEMBERING ANYTHING SPECIFIC 

3005
01:50:41,201 --> 01:50:42,936
BUT IT IS POSSIBLE. 

3006
01:50:42,936 --> 01:50:45,739
IT IS VERY COMMON WHEN YOU ARE 

3007
01:50:45,739 --> 01:50:46,872
IN THE SELECTION PROCESS TO 

3008
01:50:46,872 --> 01:50:51,144
DETERMINE WHAT ARE ALL THE 

3009
01:50:51,144 --> 01:50:53,046
SENATORS INTERESTED IN FOR THE 

3010
01:50:53,046 --> 01:50:55,548
UPCOMING NOMINEE OR HEARING? 

3011
01:50:55,548 --> 01:51:01,354
THAT IS THE COIN OF THE REALM. 

3012
01:51:01,354 --> 01:51:06,392
SENATOR X IS INTERESTED IN 

3013
01:51:06,392 --> 01:51:07,127
FOCUSING ON THIS LAW. 

3014
01:51:07,127 --> 01:51:09,395
SENATOR Y IS GOING TO ASK ABOUT 

3015
01:51:09,395 --> 01:51:10,764
ENVIRONMENTAL LAW. 

3016
01:51:10,764 --> 01:51:12,532
THE SENATORS CONCERNED ABOUT 

3017
01:51:12,532 --> 01:51:15,635
YOUR PAST WORK FOR THIS CLIENT. 

3018
01:51:15,635 --> 01:51:17,203
AND THAT'S VERY COMMON. 

3019
01:51:17,203 --> 01:51:20,740
>> DID HE EVER ASK TO HAVE YOU 

3020
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:24,043
MEET HIM NOT AT THE WHITE 

3021
01:51:24,043 --> 01:51:25,278
HOUSE, NOT AT THE CAPITAL, IT 

3022
01:51:25,278 --> 01:51:26,112
IS HOME? 

3023
01:51:26,112 --> 01:51:28,448
>> I DON'T REMEMBER THAT. 

3024
01:51:28,448 --> 01:51:31,151
>> OKAY. 

3025
01:51:31,151 --> 01:51:32,986
>> DID HE EVER ASKED TO MEET 

3026
01:51:32,986 --> 01:51:35,288
YOU OUTSIDE OF THE WHITE HOUSE 

3027
01:51:35,288 --> 01:51:38,091
OR THE CAPITAL? 

3028
01:51:38,091 --> 01:51:40,927
>> I CAN'T RULE THAT OUT. 

3029
01:51:40,927 --> 01:51:42,362
BUT AGAIN, THAT WOULD NOT HAVE 

3030
01:51:42,362 --> 01:51:42,762
BEEN TYPICAL. 

3031
01:51:42,762 --> 01:51:47,534
>> DID HE EVER HAND YOU MATERIAL

3032
01:51:47,534 --> 01:51:48,935
SEPARATELY FROM WHAT WOULD BE 

3033
01:51:48,935 --> 01:51:55,108
EMAILED BACK AND FORTH? 

3034
01:51:55,108 --> 01:51:56,342
>> IF YOU'RE REFERRING TO 

3035
01:51:56,342 --> 01:51:57,243
SOMETHING IN PARTICULAR, I 

3036
01:51:57,243 --> 01:51:58,378
COULD ANSWER THAT BUT -- 

3037
01:51:58,378 --> 01:52:00,180
>> DID YOU EVER RECEIVE 

3038
01:52:00,180 --> 01:52:02,348
INFORMATION VIA MR. MIRANDA, 

3039
01:52:02,348 --> 01:52:08,021
INFORMATION MARKED CONFIDENTIAL,

3040
01:52:08,021 --> 01:52:09,389
THAT INFORMED YOU THAT MY STAFF 

3041
01:52:09,389 --> 01:52:10,823
WAS SHARING THINGS WITH OTHER 

3042
01:52:10,823 --> 01:52:12,525
DEMOCRATS? 

3043
01:52:12,525 --> 01:52:13,827
>> I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO 

3044
01:52:13,827 --> 01:52:14,861
THAT, SENATOR. 

3045
01:52:14,861 --> 01:52:16,695
BUT AGAIN, IT IS NOT ALWAYS THE 

3046
01:52:16,695 --> 01:52:24,070
CASE THAT THE PEOPLE WERE 

3047
01:52:24,070 --> 01:52:24,771
NECESSARILY WORKING AT ODDS. 

3048
01:52:24,771 --> 01:52:26,473
IT SEEMED LIKE A LOT OF TIMES 

3049
01:52:26,473 --> 01:52:29,475
THE STAFF WAS COOPERATING, AT 

3050
01:52:29,475 --> 01:52:32,579
TIMES, NOT AT OTHER TIMES 

3051
01:52:32,579 --> 01:52:34,214
OBVIOUSLY. 

3052
01:52:34,214 --> 01:52:36,182
BUT AT TIMES OVER NOMINATIONS. 

3053
01:52:36,182 --> 01:52:38,084
IT WOULDN'T HAVE RAISED 

3054
01:52:38,084 --> 01:52:39,185
ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR IN MY 

3055
01:52:39,185 --> 01:52:42,789
MIND IF WE LEARNED SENATOR 

3056
01:52:42,789 --> 01:52:44,591
LEAHY IS CONCERNED ABOUT THIS. 

3057
01:52:44,591 --> 01:52:46,759
>>  DID MY STAFF EVER SEND YOU 

3058
01:52:46,759 --> 01:52:47,927
CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL FROM 

3059
01:52:47,927 --> 01:52:49,996
SENATOR HATCH THAT WAS STOLEN 

3060
01:52:49,996 --> 01:52:51,231
FROM HIS EMAILS? 

3061
01:52:51,231 --> 01:52:57,871
>> NOT THE LAST PART BUT -- I 

3062
01:52:57,871 --> 01:52:58,805
CERTAINLY DID TALK TO YOUR 

3063
01:52:58,805 --> 01:53:00,106
STAFF WHEN I WAS WORKING ON THE 

3064
01:53:00,106 --> 01:53:03,877
AIRLINE BILL ON THE AIRLINE 

3065
01:53:03,877 --> 01:53:04,377
BILL. 

3066
01:53:04,377 --> 01:53:08,047
I REMEMBER BEING HERE ALL NIGHT 

3067
01:53:08,047 --> 01:53:09,149
ONE NIGHT WITH YOUR STAFF. 

3068
01:53:09,149 --> 01:53:10,683
I'M SURE WE DID TALK THAT NIGHT 

3069
01:53:10,683 --> 01:53:11,283
ABOUT WHAT OTHER SENATORS 

3070
01:53:11,283 --> 01:53:11,684
THOUGHT. 

3071
01:53:11,684 --> 01:53:16,723
THAT WAS THE BILL AS YOU RECALL,

3072
01:53:16,723 --> 01:53:21,661
SPEAKER HAS WAS INVOLVED. I 

3073
01:53:21,661 --> 01:53:26,266
WORKED HARD WITH YOUR STAFF ON 

3074
01:53:26,266 --> 01:53:26,866
THAT. 

3075
01:53:26,866 --> 01:53:28,167
IT WAS NOT UNCOMMON AT ALL TO 

3076
01:53:28,167 --> 01:53:31,804
BE TALKING WITH OUR TEAM WITH 

3077
01:53:31,804 --> 01:53:32,906
WHAT SENATORS ON BOTH SIDES 

3078
01:53:32,906 --> 01:53:33,139
THINK. 

3079
01:53:33,139 --> 01:53:35,475
IT DIDN'T STRIKE ME THAT IT WAS 

3080
01:53:35,475 --> 01:53:37,076
ALWAYS ARMED CAMPS. 

3081
01:53:37,076 --> 01:53:40,246
>> BUT NO -- OFTENTIMES IT WAS 

3082
01:53:40,246 --> 01:53:40,446
NOT. 

3083
01:53:40,446 --> 01:53:42,448
BUT HERE YOU ARE GETTING 

3084
01:53:42,448 --> 01:53:44,751
OBVIOUSLY, VERY PRIVATE 

3085
01:53:44,751 --> 01:53:48,888
DEMOCRATIC EMAILS. 

3086
01:53:48,888 --> 01:53:50,290
YOU WEREN'T CONCERNED ABOUT HOW 

3087
01:53:50,290 --> 01:53:52,759
MR. MIRANDA GOT THEM? 

3088
01:53:52,759 --> 01:53:54,427
>> I'M NOT SURE ABOUT YOUR 

3089
01:53:54,427 --> 01:54:05,004
PREMISE. 

3090
01:54:05,004 --> 01:54:05,638
>> WERE YOU ALL CONCERNED ABOUT 

3091
01:54:05,638 --> 01:54:06,172
WHERE HE GOT SOME OF THE 

3092
01:54:06,172 --> 01:54:06,772
MATERIAL HE WAS SHOWING YOU? 

3093
01:54:06,772 --> 01:54:07,273
>> I DON'T RECALL THAT. 

3094
01:54:07,273 --> 01:54:07,974
BUT ON THE PREMISE OF YOUR LAST 

3095
01:54:07,974 --> 01:54:08,641
QUESTION, I WANT TO STEP BACK 

3096
01:54:08,641 --> 01:54:08,908
TO THAT. 

3097
01:54:08,908 --> 01:54:10,143
I'M NOT SURE I AGREE WITH THE 

3098
01:54:10,143 --> 01:54:10,410
PREMISE. 

3099
01:54:10,410 --> 01:54:11,611
>> IF YOU'RE GETTING SOMETHING 

3100
01:54:11,611 --> 01:54:14,480
THAT IS MARKED CONFIDENTIAL, 

3101
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:16,783
WENCH YOU ASSUME THAT IS NOT 

3102
01:54:16,783 --> 01:54:17,617
SOMETHING BEING SHARED BACK AND 

3103
01:54:17,617 --> 01:54:17,917
FORTH? 

3104
01:54:17,917 --> 01:54:20,553
>> UNLESS IT WAS SHARED. 

3105
01:54:20,553 --> 01:54:21,688
THIS IS THE THING. 

3106
01:54:21,688 --> 01:54:24,257
IF A STAFFER SAYS HERO -- HERE 

3107
01:54:24,257 --> 01:54:26,993
IS WHAT WE ARE SENDING AND YOU 

3108
01:54:26,993 --> 01:54:28,094
SHOULD BE AWARE OF THIS BECAUSE 

3109
01:54:28,094 --> 01:54:30,330
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE -- WE ARE 

3110
01:54:30,330 --> 01:54:32,265
GOING TO BE REALLY OPPOSED TO 

3111
01:54:32,265 --> 01:54:32,598
THIS NOMINEE. 

3112
01:54:32,598 --> 01:54:34,701
TO BE CLEAR, IT SEEMED 

3113
01:54:34,701 --> 01:54:36,235
SOMETIMES THERE WERE NOMINEES 

3114
01:54:36,235 --> 01:54:38,738
YOU'RE VERY OPPOSED TO AND 

3115
01:54:38,738 --> 01:54:40,006
SOMETIMES YOU'RE SUPPORTIVE OF 

3116
01:54:40,006 --> 01:54:42,475
THEM AND SOMETIMES IN BETWEEN. 

3117
01:54:42,475 --> 01:54:45,144
AND THERE WOULD BE MESSAGES 

3118
01:54:45,144 --> 01:54:46,279
PASSED BACK AND FORTH AND 

3119
01:54:46,279 --> 01:54:47,881
SHARING OF INFORMATION, VERY 

3120
01:54:47,881 --> 01:54:49,115
COOPERATIVE. 

3121
01:54:49,115 --> 01:54:54,487
AS I RECALL. WHEN YOU HAD 

3122
01:54:54,487 --> 01:54:55,188
PROBLEMS WITH NOMINEES, I 

3123
01:54:55,188 --> 01:54:55,655
RECALL TRANSPARENCY. 

3124
01:54:55,655 --> 01:54:57,056
AND WHEN YOU WERE SUPPORTIVE, 

3125
01:54:57,056 --> 01:55:01,361
YOU ARE AT THE MAIN NINTH, -- 

3126
01:55:01,361 --> 01:55:06,632
MAY 9, 2001 EVENT. AND YOU WORK 

3127
01:55:06,632 --> 01:55:09,669
SUPPORTIVE OF MANY OF THEM. 

3128
01:55:09,669 --> 01:55:15,141
>> BUT -- I VOTED FOR A LOT OF 

3129
01:55:15,141 --> 01:55:17,310
REPUBLICAN NOMINEES. 

3130
01:55:17,310 --> 01:55:19,212
BOTH TO THE SUPREME COURT AND 

3131
01:55:19,212 --> 01:55:20,480
DISTRICT COURTS. 

3132
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:22,015
>> YES. 

3133
01:55:22,015 --> 01:55:26,319
>> BUT WHAT I IMPOSED WITH 

3134
01:55:26,319 --> 01:55:28,454
JUDGE OWEN  AND RAISING 

3135
01:55:28,454 --> 01:55:30,390
QUESTIONS ABOUT FUNDING THAT 

3136
01:55:30,390 --> 01:55:31,290
SHE WAS GETTING FROM PEOPLE 

3137
01:55:31,290 --> 01:55:37,363
THAT WERE BEFORE HER COURT, THAT

3138
01:55:37,363 --> 01:55:39,399
MIGHT HAVE RAISED A RED FLAG 

3139
01:55:39,399 --> 01:55:40,967
THAT I MIGHT'VE HAD CONCERNS 

3140
01:55:40,967 --> 01:55:42,035
ABOUT HER. 

3141
01:55:42,035 --> 01:55:43,136
NOW WHEN YOU WORKED AT THE 

3142
01:55:43,136 --> 01:55:44,037
WHITE HOUSE, DID ANYONE EVER 

3143
01:55:44,037 --> 01:55:47,273
TELL YOU THEY HAD A MOLE THAT 

3144
01:55:47,273 --> 01:55:48,674
PROVIDED THEM WITH SECRET 

3145
01:55:48,674 --> 01:55:50,076
INFORMATION RELATED TO 

3146
01:55:50,076 --> 01:55:50,576
NOMINATIONS? 

3147
01:55:50,576 --> 01:55:54,247
>> I DON'T RECALL THE REFERENCE 

3148
01:55:54,247 --> 01:55:56,482
TO A MOLE WHICH SOUNDS HIGHLY 

3149
01:55:56,482 --> 01:55:58,818
SPECIFIC BUT CERTAINLY IT IS 

3150
01:55:58,818 --> 01:56:03,556
COMMON, AGAIN, AND THE PEOPLE 

3151
01:56:03,556 --> 01:56:04,490
BEHIND YOU CAN PROBABLY REFER 

3152
01:56:04,490 --> 01:56:06,826
TO THIS -- BUT IT IT IS, AND I 

3153
01:56:06,826 --> 01:56:08,594
THINK, FOR EVERYBODY TO TALK TO 

3154
01:56:08,594 --> 01:56:10,163
EACH OTHER AND SHARE 

3155
01:56:10,163 --> 01:56:10,496
INFORMATION. 

3156
01:56:10,496 --> 01:56:13,633
AT LEAST THIS WAS MY EXPERIENCE.

3157
01:56:13,633 --> 01:56:15,068
THIS WAS ALMOST 20 YEARS AGO. 

3158
01:56:15,068 --> 01:56:15,968
YOU WOULD TALK TO PEOPLE. 

3159
01:56:15,968 --> 01:56:17,170
>> YOU NEVER RECEIVED AN EMAIL 

3160
01:56:17,170 --> 01:56:19,539
FROM A STAFF MEMBER WITH 

3161
01:56:19,539 --> 01:56:21,374
INFORMATION CLAIMING TO COME 

3162
01:56:21,374 --> 01:56:28,514
FROM SPYING ON DEMOCRATICS? 

3163
01:56:28,514 --> 01:56:30,183
>> I'M NOT GOING TO RULE 

3164
01:56:30,183 --> 01:56:31,050
ANYTHING OUT, SENATOR. 

3165
01:56:31,050 --> 01:56:32,885
BUT IF I DID, I WOULDN'T HAVE 

3166
01:56:32,885 --> 01:56:36,422
THOUGHT THAT THE LITERAL [ 

3167
01:56:36,422 --> 01:56:38,458
LAUGHTER ] MEANING OF THAT. 

3168
01:56:38,458 --> 01:56:40,493
>> WOULDN'T IT HAVE SURPRISE 

3169
01:56:40,493 --> 01:56:45,098
YOU THAT YOU GOT AN EMAIL 

3170
01:56:45,098 --> 01:56:46,232
SAYING YOU GOT THAT FROM 

3171
01:56:46,232 --> 01:56:46,733
SOMEBODY SPYING -- 

3172
01:56:46,733 --> 01:56:48,901
>> IS THERE SUCH AN EMAIL, SIR? 

3173
01:56:48,901 --> 01:56:51,904
>> WE HAVE TO ASKED THE 

3174
01:56:51,904 --> 01:56:53,539
CHAIRMAN WHAT HE HAS IN HIS 

3175
01:56:53,539 --> 01:56:55,475
CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL. 

3176
01:56:55,475 --> 01:57:00,813
>> BUT HERE IS THE -- IF YOU'RE 

3177
01:57:00,813 --> 01:57:01,714
REFERRING TO SOMETHING IN 

3178
01:57:01,714 --> 01:57:03,049
PARTICULAR, HERE'S WHAT I KNOW 

3179
01:57:03,049 --> 01:57:03,316
-- 

3180
01:57:03,316 --> 01:57:04,984
>> JUST STOP A MINUTE. 

3181
01:57:04,984 --> 01:57:06,318
REFERENCED TWICE IN YOUR 30 

3182
01:57:06,318 --> 01:57:07,620
MINUTES. 

3183
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:09,354
AND DON'T TAKE THIS OFF OF HIS 

3184
01:57:09,354 --> 01:57:10,523
TIME. 

3185
01:57:10,523 --> 01:57:11,224
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE 

3186
01:57:11,224 --> 01:57:13,659
PERIOD OF TIME THAT HIS -- THAT 

3187
01:57:13,659 --> 01:57:15,093
MATERIAL IS AVAILABLE TO 

3188
01:57:15,093 --> 01:57:17,263
EVERYBODY. 

3189
01:57:17,263 --> 01:57:22,235
>> SO, THAT MATERIAL ABOUT HIM 

3190
01:57:22,235 --> 01:57:24,303
THAT IS MARKED COMMITTEE 

3191
01:57:24,303 --> 01:57:26,004
CONFIDENTIAL IS NOW PUBLIC AND 

3192
01:57:26,004 --> 01:57:27,240
AVAILABLE? 

3193
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:31,811
IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING? 

3194
01:57:31,811 --> 01:57:32,812
THAT'S WHAT THE CHAIRMAN IS 

3195
01:57:32,812 --> 01:57:34,147
SAYING AND WE HAVE A WHOLE NEW 

3196
01:57:34,147 --> 01:57:34,947
SERIES OF QUESTIONS. 

3197
01:57:34,947 --> 01:57:35,214
>> NO. 

3198
01:57:35,214 --> 01:57:36,516
NOT COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL BUT 

3199
01:57:36,516 --> 01:57:39,285
JUST -- YOU HAVE ACCESS TO IT. 

3200
01:57:39,285 --> 01:57:41,754
NOT -- 

3201
01:57:41,754 --> 01:57:43,723
>> I DON'T HAVE 80% OF THE 

3202
01:57:43,723 --> 01:57:44,590
MATERIAL WE HAVE GOTTEN FROM 

3203
01:57:44,590 --> 01:57:45,024
THE LIBRARY. 

3204
01:57:45,024 --> 01:57:46,959
IT IS ON THE WEBSITE OF THE 

3205
01:57:46,959 --> 01:57:48,794
COMMITTEE SO THE PUBLIC'S 

3206
01:57:48,794 --> 01:57:49,795
ACCESS TO IT. 

3207
01:57:49,795 --> 01:57:50,630
PROCEED. 

3208
01:57:50,630 --> 01:57:58,604
>> I WANT -- I WANT -- I WANT 

3209
01:57:58,604 --> 01:57:59,639
JUDGE KAVANAUGH TO HAVE ACCESS 

3210
01:57:59,639 --> 01:58:00,740
TO WE CAN ASK OF THESE 

3211
01:58:00,740 --> 01:58:01,574
QUESTIONS UNDER OATH.  

3212
01:58:01,574 --> 01:58:06,546
SO I WOULD ASK THE -- AND WILL 

3213
01:58:06,546 --> 01:58:07,647
HAVE ANOTHER ROUND BUT I WOULD 

3214
01:58:07,647 --> 01:58:09,081
ASK THE CHAIRMAN TO LOOK AT 

3215
01:58:09,081 --> 01:58:10,582
SOME OF THESE THAT ARE MARKED 

3216
01:58:10,582 --> 01:58:11,284
COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL WHICH 

3217
01:58:11,284 --> 01:58:15,955
LIMITS THE ABILITY TO ASK YOU 

3218
01:58:15,955 --> 01:58:16,822
SPECIFICALLY IN HAND YOU THE 

3219
01:58:16,822 --> 01:58:17,222
SPECIFIC EMAILS. 

3220
01:58:17,222 --> 01:58:20,226
BUT I WOULD STATE WHAT HAS BEEN 

3221
01:58:20,226 --> 01:58:21,694
PUBLIC -- 

3222
01:58:21,694 --> 01:58:23,529
>> LET ME ANSWER THAT FOR YOU. 

3223
01:58:23,529 --> 01:58:26,799
THERE IS ONLY ONE DEMOCRATIC 

3224
01:58:26,799 --> 01:58:27,600
SENATOR WHO WAS ASKED FOR 

3225
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:29,001
ACCESS TO THAT. 

3226
01:58:29,001 --> 01:58:30,870
IF YOU ARE INTERESTED, YOU 

3227
01:58:30,870 --> 01:58:32,572
COULD'VE BEEN ASKING EVER SINCE 

3228
01:58:32,572 --> 01:58:35,074
AUGUST 25. 

3229
01:58:35,074 --> 01:58:36,309
>> WE'VE BEEN ASKING TO HAVE 

3230
01:58:36,309 --> 01:58:40,947
THAT MADE PUBLIC. AND I'M NOT 

3231
01:58:40,947 --> 01:58:44,617
AS INTERESTED IF I SEE THOSE IN 

3232
01:58:44,617 --> 01:58:45,952
A CLOSED ROOM WHERE I CAN'T 

3233
01:58:45,952 --> 01:58:46,652
TALK ABOUT IT. 

3234
01:58:46,652 --> 01:58:49,288
I WANT JUDGE KAVANAUGH  TO SEE 

3235
01:58:49,288 --> 01:58:53,392
THE EMAILS WHICH CAME FROM MR. 

3236
01:58:53,392 --> 01:58:56,596
MIRANDA AND -- 

3237
01:58:56,596 --> 01:58:59,699
>> GIVE US A CITATION OF THE 

3238
01:58:59,699 --> 01:59:00,800
DOCUMENTS AND WE WILL BE AT 

3239
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:01,300
THEM FOR YOU. 

3240
01:59:01,300 --> 01:59:04,870
>> THAT TESTIMONY UP THERE IS 

3241
01:59:04,870 --> 01:59:05,738
TRUE. 

3242
01:59:05,738 --> 01:59:07,206
100%. 

3243
01:59:07,206 --> 01:59:08,975
>> CAN SOMEBODY READ THAT? 

3244
01:59:08,975 --> 01:59:11,143
I CAN'T SEE IT. 

3245
01:59:11,143 --> 01:59:11,343
WHAT? 

3246
01:59:11,343 --> 01:59:14,680
>> OF COURSE, IT WOULD BE 

3247
01:59:14,680 --> 01:59:21,687
HELPFUL IF WE ALLOWED THE 

3248
01:59:21,687 --> 01:59:22,488
NATIONAL ARCHIVES TO COMPLETE 

3249
01:59:22,488 --> 01:59:22,922
THE REVIEW. 

3250
01:59:22,922 --> 01:59:24,257
>> I JUST WANT TO REASSURE YOU, 

3251
01:59:24,257 --> 01:59:25,491
SENATOR, THAT WHAT YOU HAVE ON 

3252
01:59:25,491 --> 01:59:27,426
THE BOARD IS 100% ACCURATE. 

3253
01:59:27,426 --> 01:59:30,763
>> CAN SOMEBODY MOVE IT SO WE 

3254
01:59:30,763 --> 01:59:32,031
CAN SEE IT HERE? 

3255
01:59:32,031 --> 01:59:33,866
>> WELL, I'M CONCERNED. 

3256
01:59:33,866 --> 01:59:36,002
BECAUSE THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT 

3257
01:59:36,002 --> 01:59:37,937
MR. MIRANDA PROVIDED YOU WITH 

3258
01:59:37,937 --> 01:59:39,305
MATERIALS THAT WERE STOLEN FROM 

3259
01:59:39,305 --> 01:59:40,873
ME. 

3260
01:59:40,873 --> 01:59:44,076
AND THAT WOULD CONTRADICT YOUR 

3261
01:59:44,076 --> 01:59:45,945
PRIOR TESTIMONY. 

3262
01:59:45,945 --> 01:59:47,313
>> HOLD THAT. 

3263
01:59:47,313 --> 01:59:49,915
>> IT IS TOO CLEAR FROM PUBLIC 

3264
01:59:49,915 --> 01:59:56,856
EMAILS -- YOU HAD REASON TO 

3265
01:59:56,856 --> 01:59:59,191
BELIEVE THOSE MATERIALS WERE 

3266
01:59:59,191 --> 02:00:02,595
OBTAINED INAPPROPRIATELY AT THE 

3267
02:00:02,595 --> 02:00:04,163
TIME. 

3268
02:00:04,163 --> 02:00:05,198
MR. CHAIRMAN, THERE ARE AT 

3269
02:00:05,198 --> 02:00:06,098
LEAST SIX DOCUMENTS THAT YOU 

3270
02:00:06,098 --> 02:00:07,833
CONSIDER CONFIDENTIAL BETTER 

3271
02:00:07,833 --> 02:00:10,169
DIRECTLY RELATED TO THIS. 

3272
02:00:10,169 --> 02:00:11,304
JUST LIKE THE THREE DOCUMENTS 

3273
02:00:11,304 --> 02:00:13,139
THAT I SHARED THAT ARE ALREADY 

3274
02:00:13,139 --> 02:00:13,372
PUBLIC. 

3275
02:00:13,372 --> 02:00:15,775
THESE OTHER SIX CONTAIN NO 

3276
02:00:15,775 --> 02:00:18,811
PERSONAL INFORMATION, NO 

3277
02:00:18,811 --> 02:00:21,047
PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS, AND 

3278
02:00:21,047 --> 02:00:21,914
RESTRICTED MATERIAL. 

3279
02:00:21,914 --> 02:00:23,149
THERE IS SIMPLY NO REASON THAT 

3280
02:00:23,149 --> 02:00:25,518
CAN BE MADE PUBLIC. I HOPE THEY 

3281
02:00:25,518 --> 02:00:29,121
WILL BE BEFORE THIS NEXT ROUND. 

3282
02:00:29,121 --> 02:00:34,227
YOU KNOW, IT IS DIFFICULT TO 

3283
02:00:34,227 --> 02:00:36,329
ASK A QUESTION I HAVE TO ASK A 

3284
02:00:36,329 --> 02:00:40,633
REPUBLICAN TO ALLOW ME TO ASK 

3285
02:00:40,633 --> 02:00:41,233
THE QUESTION. 

3286
02:00:41,233 --> 02:00:43,269
I CERTAINLY NEVER DID THAT. 

3287
02:00:43,269 --> 02:00:45,004
I NEVER DID THAT WHEN I WAS 

3288
02:00:45,004 --> 02:00:46,072
CHAIRMAN. 

3289
02:00:46,072 --> 02:00:49,542
NOW, I HAD ASKED YOU IN 2006 IF 

3290
02:00:49,542 --> 02:00:50,676
YOU HAD SEEN ANY DOCUMENTS 

3291
02:00:50,676 --> 02:00:57,149
RELATED TO PRESIDENT BUSH'S WIRE

3292
02:00:57,149 --> 02:00:58,584
TAPPING PROGRAM OR IF YOU HAD 

3293
02:00:58,584 --> 02:00:59,285
HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT IT. 

3294
02:00:59,285 --> 02:01:00,319
YOU ANSWERED THAT YOU LEARNED 

3295
02:01:00,319 --> 02:01:02,888
ABOUT IT WITH THE REST OF US IN 

3296
02:01:02,888 --> 02:01:05,424
DECEMBER 2005 WHEN IT WAS 

3297
02:01:05,424 --> 02:01:07,660
REPORTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES. 

3298
02:01:07,660 --> 02:01:08,961
I KNOW IT HAS BEEN 12 YEARS. 

3299
02:01:08,961 --> 02:01:11,664
SO HERE IS A VIDEO OF YOUR 

3300
02:01:11,664 --> 02:01:13,733
SWORN TESTIMONY. 

3301
02:01:21,373 --> 02:01:23,208
IT SHOULD BE ON THE TV SCREENS. 

3302
02:01:23,208 --> 02:01:26,345
THE DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE 

3303
02:01:26,345 --> 02:01:28,814
PRESIDENT'S WARRANT TAPPING 

3304
02:01:28,814 --> 02:01:31,183
PROGRAM -- 

3305
02:01:31,183 --> 02:01:32,685
>> SENATOR, I LEARNED OF THAT 

3306
02:01:32,685 --> 02:01:33,819
PROGRAM WHEN THERE WAS A NEW 

3307
02:01:33,819 --> 02:01:38,290
YORK TIMES STORY THAT CAME OVER 

3308
02:01:38,290 --> 02:01:39,925
THE WIRE, I THINK IT WAS A 

3309
02:01:39,925 --> 02:01:41,360
THURSDAY NIGHT IN DECEMBER OF 

3310
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:42,228
LAST YEAR. 

3311
02:01:42,228 --> 02:01:44,397
THE YOU HAD NOT SEEN ANYTHING? 

3312
02:01:44,397 --> 02:01:47,266
HAD YOU HEARD ANYTHING PRIOR TO 

3313
02:01:47,266 --> 02:01:48,234
THE ARTICLE? 

3314
02:01:48,234 --> 02:01:49,402
>> NO. 

3315
02:01:49,402 --> 02:01:51,604
>> NOTHING AT ALL? 

3316
02:01:51,604 --> 02:02:02,581
>> NOTHING AT ALL. 

3317
02:02:02,581 --> 02:02:04,516
>> AS FAR AS I KNOW, IN 15 

3318
02:02:04,516 --> 02:02:07,286
HEARINGS -- I'M GOING TO READ 

3319
02:02:07,286 --> 02:02:10,723
SOMETHING BUT PREFACE IT WITH 

3320
02:02:10,723 --> 02:02:11,023
THIS. 

3321
02:02:11,023 --> 02:02:12,658
AS FAR AS I KNOW IN THE 15 

3322
02:02:12,658 --> 02:02:13,759
HEARINGS I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN, 

3323
02:02:13,759 --> 02:02:15,628
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN SUCH A 

3324
02:02:15,628 --> 02:02:17,029
VIDEO SHOWN. 

3325
02:02:17,029 --> 02:02:20,566
SO SINCE THIS IS PRESIDENTIAL I 

3326
02:02:20,566 --> 02:02:23,502
WANT TO READ THIS. 

3327
02:02:23,502 --> 02:02:25,371
THE USE OF A VIDEO EDIT 

3328
02:02:25,371 --> 02:02:26,238
CONFIRMATION IS HIGHLY 

3329
02:02:26,238 --> 02:02:27,373
IRREGULAR BUT I SEE NO REASON 

3330
02:02:27,373 --> 02:02:28,674
WHY MY COLLEAGUES CAN'T USE A 

3331
02:02:28,674 --> 02:02:30,843
VIDEO THAT WAS PROVIDED BY THE 

3332
02:02:30,843 --> 02:02:33,145
NOMINEE HIMSELF IN RESPONSE TO 

3333
02:02:33,145 --> 02:02:35,581
THE SENATE QUESTIONNAIRE. 

3334
02:02:35,581 --> 02:02:36,782
I HAVE BEEN ASSURED THAT THE 

3335
02:02:36,782 --> 02:02:38,651
VIDEO IS FROM JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 

3336
02:02:38,651 --> 02:02:42,254
SUMMATION. PASTE IN THIS, WE 

3337
02:02:42,254 --> 02:02:45,558
HAVE ALLOWED THIS VIDEO TO BE 

3338
02:02:45,558 --> 02:02:45,791
SHOWN. 

3339
02:02:45,791 --> 02:02:46,959
I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT I 

3340
02:02:46,959 --> 02:02:49,128
EXPECT THAT VIDEO TO BE USED 

3341
02:02:49,128 --> 02:02:49,361
FAIRLY. 

3342
02:02:49,361 --> 02:02:50,429
THE CLIPS SHOULD NOT BE 

3343
02:02:50,429 --> 02:02:52,798
PRESENTED IN A WAY THAT DEPRIVES

3344
02:02:52,798 --> 02:02:56,302
RELATIVE CONTEXT. 

3345
02:02:56,302 --> 02:02:56,936
THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH 

3346
02:02:56,936 --> 02:02:59,872
REQUIREMENTS IN FEDERAL COURT. 

3347
02:02:59,872 --> 02:03:00,773
THAT'S WHY INSIST THAT JUDGE 

3348
02:03:00,773 --> 02:03:02,942
KAVANAUGH  HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY 

3349
02:03:02,942 --> 02:03:05,978
TO REQUEST IF ANY ADDITIONAL 

3350
02:03:05,978 --> 02:03:10,249
VIDEO BE PLAYED IF IT PROVIDES 

3351
02:03:10,249 --> 02:03:10,916
APPROPRIATE CONTEXT. 

3352
02:03:10,916 --> 02:03:14,220
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT MORE 

3353
02:03:14,220 --> 02:03:15,988
CONTEXT IS NEEDED TO ADDRESS 

3354
02:03:15,988 --> 02:03:20,492
THE QUESTION, JUDGE KAVANAUGH? 

3355
02:03:20,492 --> 02:03:22,328
>> I DON'T THINK I'VE HEARD THE 

3356
02:03:22,328 --> 02:03:23,128
QUESTION YET BUT I'LL LET YOU 

3357
02:03:23,128 --> 02:03:24,363
KNOW  WHEN I'VE HEARD IT. 

3358
02:03:24,363 --> 02:03:27,199
>> LET ME ASK YOU THIS, I WILL 

3359
02:03:27,199 --> 02:03:30,703
REPEAT THE QUESTION AS BEFORE. 

3360
02:03:30,703 --> 02:03:31,837
YOU SAID YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS 

3361
02:03:31,837 --> 02:03:36,976
WITH THE REST OF US IN DECEMBER 

3362
02:03:36,976 --> 02:03:39,979
OF 2005. 

3363
02:03:39,979 --> 02:03:41,180
YOU SAID THAT YOU HAD NO 

3364
02:03:41,180 --> 02:03:41,780
KNOWLEDGE OF ANYTHING RELATED 

3365
02:03:41,780 --> 02:03:43,549
TO THIS UNTIL THE NEW YORK 

3366
02:03:43,549 --> 02:03:48,320

3368

17, WHICH WAS BEFORE THE -- 

3369
02:03:56,027 --> 02:03:58,264
SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE THE 

3370
02:03:58,264 --> 02:04:01,700
ARTICLE BY THE NEW YORK TIMES, 

3371
02:04:01,700 --> 02:04:04,503
JOHN SHOWED YOU A MEMO ON 

3372
02:04:04,503 --> 02:04:06,605
SURVEILLANCE THAT HELPED FORM 

3373
02:04:06,605 --> 02:04:11,977
THE OPINIONS. 

3374
02:04:11,977 --> 02:04:13,812
WHEN YOU WERE IN THE WHITE 

3375
02:04:13,812 --> 02:04:16,282
HOUSE, IN 2001, DID YOU EVER 

3376
02:04:16,282 --> 02:04:18,951
WORK WITH JOHN ON THE 

3377
02:04:18,951 --> 02:04:20,519
IMPLICATIONS OF A WARRANTLESS 

3378
02:04:20,519 --> 02:04:25,691
SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM. 

3379
02:04:25,691 --> 02:04:27,460
>> WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A LOT 

3380
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:28,393
OF DIFFERENT THINGS. 

3381
02:04:28,393 --> 02:04:31,497
>> THAT IS TALKING ABOUT A LOT 

3382
02:04:31,497 --> 02:04:31,997
OF DIFFERENT THINGS. 

3383
02:04:31,997 --> 02:04:33,632
SO WHAT YOU ARE ASKING ABOUT 

3384
02:04:33,632 --> 02:04:35,334
RIGHT THERE, THAT WAS THE 

3385
02:04:35,334 --> 02:04:38,070
SPECIFIC TERRORIST SURVEILLANCE 

3386
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:38,671
PROGRAM. 

3387
02:04:38,671 --> 02:04:40,906
>> WHICH IS A WARRANTLESS 

3388
02:04:40,906 --> 02:04:41,806
SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM. 

3389
02:04:41,806 --> 02:04:45,711
>> ALONG WITH MANY OTHERS. 

3390
02:04:45,711 --> 02:04:47,146
AND YOU WERE ASKING ME ABOUT 

3391
02:04:47,146 --> 02:04:54,320
THE TSP. THAT STORY WAS BROKEN. 

3392
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:55,621
THE TESTIMONY IS 100% ACCURATE. 

3393
02:04:55,621 --> 02:04:57,723
THAT STORE WAS BROKEN IN THE 

3394
02:04:57,723 --> 02:04:58,290
NEW YORK TIMES. 

3395
02:04:58,290 --> 02:04:59,858
I WAS NOT READ INTO THAT 

3396
02:04:59,858 --> 02:05:02,461
PROGRAM. 

3397
02:05:02,461 --> 02:05:03,829
I ACTUALLY STILL REMEMBER MY 

3398
02:05:03,829 --> 02:05:06,365
EXACT REACTION WHEN I READ THAT 

3399
02:05:06,365 --> 02:05:08,500
STORY. 

3400
02:05:08,500 --> 02:05:12,071
AND THEN THE PRESIDENT DID A 

3401
02:05:12,071 --> 02:05:13,005
LIVE RADIO ADDRESS TO EXPLAIN 

3402
02:05:13,005 --> 02:05:14,106
TO THE COUNTRY WHAT THAT 

3403
02:05:14,106 --> 02:05:14,640
PROGRAM WAS ABOUT. 

3404
02:05:14,640 --> 02:05:18,077
THERE WAS A HUGE CONTROVERSY 

3405
02:05:18,077 --> 02:05:19,078
AND SO EVERYONE WAS THEN 

3406
02:05:19,078 --> 02:05:20,579
WORKING ON GETTING A SPEECH 

3407
02:05:20,579 --> 02:05:21,714
TOGETHER. 

3408
02:05:21,714 --> 02:05:23,048
YOU ASKED IF I HAD LEARNED 

3409
02:05:23,048 --> 02:05:23,849
ABOUT IT BEFORE THEN. 

3410
02:05:23,849 --> 02:05:28,220
AND I SAID NO AND THAT IS 

3411
02:05:28,220 --> 02:05:28,621
ACCURATE. 

3412
02:05:28,621 --> 02:05:29,855
>> OKAY, WHEN YOU WERE IN THE 

3413
02:05:29,855 --> 02:05:31,090
WHITE HOUSE DID YOU EVER WORK 

3414
02:05:31,090 --> 02:05:32,691
WITH JOHN ON THE IMPLICATIONS 

3415
02:05:32,691 --> 02:05:37,096
OF ANY WARRANTLESS SURVEILLANCE 

3416
02:05:37,096 --> 02:05:37,396
PROGRAM? 

3417
02:05:37,396 --> 02:05:41,567
>> I CAN'T RULE THAT DASHED IN 

3418
02:05:41,567 --> 02:05:42,601
THE WAKE OF SEPTEMBER 11, IT 

3419
02:05:42,601 --> 02:05:46,905
WAS ALL HANDS ON DECK AND WE 

3420
02:05:46,905 --> 02:05:47,840
WERE FARMING OUT ASSIGNMENTS. 

3421
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:50,543
BUT WE WERE ALL INVOLVED. ON 

3422
02:05:50,543 --> 02:05:55,047
SEPTEMBER 12 -- LET'S BACK UP, 

3423
02:05:55,047 --> 02:05:56,281
ON SEPTEMBER 12 WOMAN CAME INTO 

3424
02:05:56,281 --> 02:05:59,718
THE WHITE HOUSE, -- WHEN WE 

3425
02:05:59,718 --> 02:06:01,553
CAME INTO THE WHITE HOUSE, IT 

3426
02:06:01,553 --> 02:06:02,755
WAS WE HAVE TO WORK ON 

3427
02:06:02,755 --> 02:06:03,055
EVERYTHING. 

3428
02:06:03,055 --> 02:06:06,058
OVER TIME, PEOPLE FIGURED OUT 

3429
02:06:06,058 --> 02:06:07,760
WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO WORK 

3430
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:08,093
ON. 

3431
02:06:08,093 --> 02:06:09,328
THE AIRLINE BUILT THAT WAS UP 

3432
02:06:09,328 --> 02:06:12,931
YOUR WHEN PRESENT -- PRESIDENT 

3433
02:06:12,931 --> 02:06:14,767
BUSH SPOKE TO CONGRESS. 

3434
02:06:14,767 --> 02:06:16,568
THEN WE ARE IN THAT MEETING 

3435
02:06:16,568 --> 02:06:19,004
ROOM TOGETHER WORKING ON THE 

3436
02:06:19,004 --> 02:06:21,440
AIRLINE BUILT BUT THERE WERE 

3437
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:23,208
ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS GOING 

3438
02:06:23,208 --> 02:06:23,442
ON. 

3439
02:06:23,442 --> 02:06:26,111
THE PATRIOT ACT WAS GOING ON. 

3440
02:06:26,111 --> 02:06:27,946
>> I WAS INVOLVED IN ALL OF 

3441
02:06:27,946 --> 02:06:30,482
THOSE. 

3442
02:06:30,482 --> 02:06:31,817
BUT WHAT I WANT TO KNOW, DID 

3443
02:06:31,817 --> 02:06:32,618
YOU EVER RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT 

3444
02:06:32,618 --> 02:06:33,585
WARRANTLESS SURVEILLANCE? 

3445
02:06:33,585 --> 02:06:37,823
>> I CAN'T RULE ANYTHING OUT. 

3446
02:06:37,823 --> 02:06:39,158
THERE WAS SO MUCH GOING ON IN 

3447
02:06:39,158 --> 02:06:40,626
THE WAKE OF SEPTEMBER 11th, 

3448
02:06:40,626 --> 02:06:43,829
SENATOR. 

3449
02:06:43,829 --> 02:06:45,063
IN THE WHITE HOUSE IN 

3450
02:06:45,063 --> 02:06:47,900
PARTICULAR, AND IN THE COUNSEL 

3451
02:06:47,900 --> 02:06:48,300
OFFICE. 

3452
02:06:48,300 --> 02:06:49,702
WE HAD EIGHT LAWYERS, EIGHT OR 

3453
02:06:49,702 --> 02:06:53,238
NINE AS I RECALL. 

3454
02:06:53,238 --> 02:06:54,540
AND THERE WERE SO MANY ISSUES 

3455
02:06:54,540 --> 02:06:55,974
TO CONSIDER FOR THE PRESIDENT 

3456
02:06:55,974 --> 02:06:59,611
AND THE LEGAL TEAM. 

3457
02:06:59,611 --> 02:07:00,746
AND LIKE I SAID, FOR PRESIDENT 

3458
02:07:00,746 --> 02:07:02,580
BUSH,  EVERYDAY WAS SEPTEMBER 

3459
02:07:02,580 --> 02:07:05,117
12. 

3460
02:07:05,117 --> 02:07:07,186
FOR THE LEGAL TEAM -- 

3461
02:07:07,186 --> 02:07:09,588
>> FOR A LOT OF US IT WAS. 

3462
02:07:09,588 --> 02:07:10,288
>> YES. 

3463
02:07:10,288 --> 02:07:20,699
>> ON AUGUST 16 OF THIS YEAR, 

3464
02:07:20,699 --> 02:07:23,001
ASKING OR MAKING DOCUMENTS 

3465
02:07:23,001 --> 02:07:32,011
RELATED TO THIS ISSUE PUBLIC -- 

3466
02:07:32,011 --> 02:07:33,145
WITHOUT THEM BEING PUBLIC, IT 

3467
02:07:33,145 --> 02:07:34,680
IS NOT FAIR TO ME AND NOT FAIR 

3468
02:07:34,680 --> 02:07:35,881
TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH THAT I 

3469
02:07:35,881 --> 02:07:38,550
CANNOT HAND HIM  THE ACTUAL 

3470
02:07:38,550 --> 02:07:41,253
DOCUMENTS WHICH I THINK WOULD 

3471
02:07:41,253 --> 02:07:45,324
REFRESH HIS MEMORY AND I WOULD 

3472
02:07:45,324 --> 02:07:48,327
ASK, AGAIN, TO LOOK AT THAT 

3473
02:07:48,327 --> 02:07:49,228
BEFORE MY NEXT TERM. 

3474
02:07:49,228 --> 02:07:55,334
CAN WE MAKE THOSE PUBLIC? 

3475
02:07:55,334 --> 02:07:57,369
>> YOU TELL US WHAT DOCUMENTS 

3476
02:07:57,369 --> 02:07:58,837
YOU WANT AND I WILL MAKE THEM 

3477
02:07:58,837 --> 02:08:00,572
AVAILABLE TO YOU BUT I CAN'T 

3478
02:08:00,572 --> 02:08:02,040
SAY THAT THEY CAN BE MADE 

3479
02:08:02,040 --> 02:08:04,109
PUBLIC. 

3480
02:08:04,109 --> 02:08:09,248
JUST AS I SAID LAST YEAR DURING 

3481
02:08:09,248 --> 02:08:18,791
JUDGE GORSUCH'S CONFIRMATION. 

3482
02:08:18,791 --> 02:08:20,359
ALL I ASKED WAS MY COLLEAGUES 

3483
02:08:20,359 --> 02:08:21,326
TO IDENTIFY THE DOCUMENTS THEY 

3484
02:08:21,326 --> 02:08:22,761
INTENDED TO USE AND I WOULD 

3485
02:08:22,761 --> 02:08:24,195
WORK TO GET THE DEPARTMENT OF 

3486
02:08:24,195 --> 02:08:26,365
JUSTICE AND FORMER PRESIDENT 

3487
02:08:26,365 --> 02:08:29,467
BUSH  TO AGREE TO WAIVE HER 

3488
02:08:29,467 --> 02:08:30,369
RESTRICTIONS. 

3489
02:08:30,369 --> 02:08:31,570
SENATOR FEINSTEIN SECURED THE 

3490
02:08:31,570 --> 02:08:33,872
PUBLIC  RELEASE OF 19 DOCUMENTS 

3491
02:08:33,872 --> 02:08:36,040
LAST YEAR UNDER THIS PROCESS. 

3492
02:08:36,040 --> 02:08:38,844
AND SENATOR KLOBUCHAR SECURED  

3493
02:08:38,844 --> 02:08:40,112
THE RELEASE OF FOUR DOCUMENTS 

3494
02:08:40,112 --> 02:08:42,915
THIS YEAR. 

3495
02:08:42,915 --> 02:08:44,149
IF OTHER DOCUMENTS SHOULD HAVE 

3496
02:08:44,149 --> 02:08:45,250
BEEN MADE PUBLIC, THEY NEVER 

3497
02:08:45,250 --> 02:08:46,785
TOLD ME ABOUT THEM. 

3498
02:08:46,785 --> 02:08:49,621
SO LET US KNOW. 

3499
02:08:49,621 --> 02:08:51,190
LET US KNOW WHAT YOU WANT AND 

3500
02:08:51,190 --> 02:08:55,260
THEN YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND WE'LL 

3501
02:08:55,260 --> 02:08:56,261
GET THEM FOR YOU. 

3502
02:08:56,261 --> 02:08:58,230
>> I WANT THE SAME THING AND 

3503
02:08:58,230 --> 02:08:59,832
REQUESTED IN AUGUST. 

3504
02:08:59,832 --> 02:09:02,166
IT IS DIRECTLY REALLY VALID -- 

3505
02:09:02,166 --> 02:09:05,304
RELEVANT TO HIS TESTIMONY. 

3506
02:09:05,304 --> 02:09:08,607
DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO THE 

3507
02:09:08,607 --> 02:09:09,742
QUESTIONS I'VE BEEN ASKING 

3508
02:09:09,742 --> 02:09:10,042
HERE. 

3509
02:09:10,042 --> 02:09:11,876
DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO HIS OWN 

3510
02:09:11,876 --> 02:09:16,148
EMAILS WITH JOHN. 

3511
02:09:16,148 --> 02:09:18,784
BEFORE MY NEXT TURN WE COULD 

3512
02:09:18,784 --> 02:09:20,352
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. 

3513
02:09:20,352 --> 02:09:28,694
>> OKAY. 

3514
02:09:28,694 --> 02:09:32,831
>> NOW MAY -- YOU SAID 

3515
02:09:32,831 --> 02:09:38,103
EVERYBODY AGREES BECAUSE -- 

3516
02:09:38,103 --> 02:09:39,571
EVERY VIOLATOR OF EVERY FEDERAL 

3517
02:09:39,571 --> 02:09:46,912
LAW, COULD A PRESIDENT ISSUE A 

3518
02:09:46,912 --> 02:09:47,946
PARDON IN EXCHANGE FOR A BRIBE? 

3519
02:09:47,946 --> 02:09:48,913
YES OR NO? 

3520
02:09:48,913 --> 02:09:51,316
>> SENATOR, I THINK THAT 

3521
02:09:51,316 --> 02:09:54,119
QUESTION HAS BEEN LITIGATED 

3522
02:09:54,119 --> 02:09:59,758
BEFORE AND I DON'T WANT TO 

3523
02:09:59,758 --> 02:10:01,160
COMMENT ABOUT -- 

3524
02:10:01,160 --> 02:10:03,028
>> LET ME ASK YOU THIS. 

3525
02:10:03,028 --> 02:10:05,330
>> PARDON. 

3526
02:10:05,330 --> 02:10:06,131
THERE ARE COUPLE OF THINGS 

3527
02:10:06,131 --> 02:10:07,966
INVOLVED IN THAT QUESTIONS -- 

3528
02:10:07,966 --> 02:10:11,403
QUESTION WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF 

3529
02:10:11,403 --> 02:10:11,803
THE PARDON? 

3530
02:10:11,803 --> 02:10:13,605
CAN YOU BE SEPARATELY CHARGED 

3531
02:10:13,605 --> 02:10:17,876
WITH THE BRIBERY CRIME? THOSE 

3532
02:10:17,876 --> 02:10:20,712
ARE TWO DISTINCT QUESTIONS. 

3533
02:10:20,712 --> 02:10:22,347
YOU WANT TO KEEP THEM SEPARATE 

3534
02:10:22,347 --> 02:10:24,549
IN THINKING ABOUT HOW THE 

3535
02:10:24,549 --> 02:10:25,751
HYPOTHETICAL -- 

3536
02:10:25,751 --> 02:10:31,456
>> IN THAT, -- CHAIRMAN, I HAVE 

3537
02:10:31,456 --> 02:10:32,958
TO INTERRUPT. 

3538
02:10:32,958 --> 02:10:34,760
I JUST WANT TO FINISH THIS. 

3539
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:36,828
>> BUT I MADE SURE IF THE TIMER 

3540
02:10:36,828 --> 02:10:40,165
DIDN'T -- GIVE HIM ONE MORE 

3541
02:10:40,165 --> 02:10:40,465
MINUTE. 

3542
02:10:40,465 --> 02:10:41,433
>> THANK YOU. 

3543
02:10:41,433 --> 02:10:44,469
>> GOD BLESS YOU. 

3544
02:10:44,469 --> 02:10:51,810
[ LAUGHTER ] PRESIDENT TRUMP 

3545
02:10:51,810 --> 02:10:53,312
CLAIMS HE HAS A RIGHT TO PARDON 

3546
02:10:53,312 --> 02:10:53,578
HIMSELF. 

3547
02:10:53,578 --> 02:10:54,245
DOES HE? 

3548
02:10:54,245 --> 02:10:58,116
>> THE QUESTION OF SELF PARDONS 

3549
02:10:58,116 --> 02:10:59,351
IS SOMETHING I'VE NEVER 

3550
02:10:59,351 --> 02:11:00,752
ANALYZED. 

3551
02:11:00,752 --> 02:11:02,588
IT IS A QUESTION THAT I HAVE 

3552
02:11:02,588 --> 02:11:04,422
NOT WRITTEN ABOUT. 

3553
02:11:04,422 --> 02:11:05,857
IT'S A QUESTION THAT IS 

3554
02:11:05,857 --> 02:11:07,826
HYPOTHETICAL. 

3555
02:11:07,826 --> 02:11:11,529
I CAN'T BEGIN TO ANSWER IN THE 

3556
02:11:11,529 --> 02:11:15,000
BEST CONTEXT. 

3557
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:16,969
AND THE OTHER HALF IS THE 

3558
02:11:16,969 --> 02:11:17,636
OBVIOUS ONE. 

3559
02:11:17,636 --> 02:11:20,539
DOES THE PRESIDENT HAVE THE 

3560
02:11:20,539 --> 02:11:24,710
ABILITY TO PARDON SOMEBODY IN 

3561
02:11:24,710 --> 02:11:26,078
EXCHANGE FOR A PROMISE FROM 

3562
02:11:26,078 --> 02:11:33,251
THAT PERSON THAT THEY WOULDN'T 

3563
02:11:33,251 --> 02:11:33,751
TESTIFY AGAINST HIM? 

3564
02:11:33,751 --> 02:11:34,953
>> SENATOR, I'M NOT GOING TO 

3565
02:11:34,953 --> 02:11:35,586
ANSWER HYPOTHETICAL QUESTIONS 

3566
02:11:35,586 --> 02:11:36,088
OF THAT SORT. 

3567
02:11:36,088 --> 02:11:37,756
AND THERE IS A GOOD REASON FOR 

3568
02:11:37,756 --> 02:11:38,056
IT. 

3569
02:11:38,056 --> 02:11:41,460
WHEN JUDGES DON'T -- WHEN WE 

3570
02:11:41,460 --> 02:11:44,029
DECIDE, WE GET BRIEFS AND 

3571
02:11:44,029 --> 02:11:44,663
ARGUMENTS FROM THE PARTIES. 

3572
02:11:44,663 --> 02:11:45,664
WE HAVE A RECORD. 

3573
02:11:45,664 --> 02:11:48,500
WE HAVE AN APPENDIX WITH THE 

3574
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:48,900
INFORMATION. 

3575
02:11:48,900 --> 02:11:51,369
WE HAVE BRIEFS. 

3576
02:11:51,369 --> 02:11:53,038
I NEVER DECIDE ANYTHING ALONE. 

3577
02:11:53,038 --> 02:11:54,673
I'M IN A PANEL OF THREE. 

3578
02:11:54,673 --> 02:11:56,808
AND IF I AM CONFIRMED, I WOULD 

3579
02:11:56,808 --> 02:11:58,176
BE ON A TEAM OF NINE. 

3580
02:11:58,176 --> 02:12:00,879
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

3581
02:12:00,879 --> 02:12:02,848
I HOPE THAT REMAINS A 

3582
02:12:02,848 --> 02:12:05,250
HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION. 

3583
02:12:05,250 --> 02:12:09,955
SINCE I'M GOING TO -- 

3584
02:12:09,955 --> 02:12:12,057
>> I'M DONE. 

3585
02:12:12,057 --> 02:12:13,692
>> SENATOR GRAHAM. 

3586
02:12:13,692 --> 02:12:17,963
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

3587
02:12:17,963 --> 02:12:20,732
JULY 21, 1993. 

3588
02:12:20,732 --> 02:12:21,032
>> YES. 

3589
02:12:21,032 --> 02:12:23,468
>> I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT YOU 

3590
02:12:23,468 --> 02:12:26,705
TO LAY OUT A TEST HERE IN THE 

3591
02:12:26,705 --> 02:12:28,473
ABSTRACT WHICH MIGHT DETERMINE 

3592
02:12:28,473 --> 02:12:29,908
WHAT YOUR VOTE OR YOUR TEST TO 

3593
02:12:29,908 --> 02:12:31,543
BE IN A CASE YOU HAVE YET TO 

3594
02:12:31,543 --> 02:12:33,679
SEE THAT MAY COME BEFORE THE 

3595
02:12:33,679 --> 02:12:34,046
SUPREME COURT. 

3596
02:12:34,046 --> 02:12:42,421
THAT WAS WISE COUNSEL IN THE 

3597
02:12:42,421 --> 02:12:43,455
CONFIRMATION. 

3598
02:12:43,455 --> 02:12:48,393
VERY DIRECTLY, DID YOU EVER 

3599
02:12:48,393 --> 02:12:50,963
KNOWINGLY PARTICIPATE IN 

3600
02:12:50,963 --> 02:12:53,932
STEALING ANYTHING FROM SENATOR 

3601
02:12:53,932 --> 02:12:54,733
LEAHY OR ANY OTHER SENATOR? 

3602
02:12:54,733 --> 02:12:58,370
>> NO.  

3603
02:12:58,370 --> 02:12:59,571
>> DID YOU EVER KNOW THAT YOU 

3604
02:12:59,571 --> 02:13:00,572
WERE DEALING WITH ANYTHING THAT 

3605
02:13:00,572 --> 02:13:01,306
WAS STOLEN PROPERTY? 

3606
02:13:01,306 --> 02:13:01,707
>> NO. 

3607
02:13:01,707 --> 02:13:06,178
>> AS TO THE TERRORIST 

3608
02:13:06,178 --> 02:13:07,112
SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM, DID YOU 

3609
02:13:07,112 --> 02:13:07,813
HELP CREATE THIS PROGRAM? 

3610
02:13:07,813 --> 02:13:08,113
>> NO. 

3611
02:13:08,113 --> 02:13:09,314
DID YOU GIVE LEGAL ADVICE ABOUT 

3612
02:13:09,314 --> 02:13:10,082
IT? 

3613
02:13:10,082 --> 02:13:11,149
>> NO. 

3614
02:13:11,149 --> 02:13:14,619
>> THANK YOU. 

3615
02:13:14,619 --> 02:13:16,421
>> WE ARE REFERRING TO THE SAME 

3616
02:13:16,421 --> 02:13:17,222
PROGRAM? 

3617
02:13:17,222 --> 02:13:18,090
>> YES. 

3618
02:13:18,090 --> 02:13:20,325
ONE THE ARTICLE WAS ABOUT. 

3619
02:13:20,325 --> 02:13:24,796
AND SO A BIT OF A RUN THROUGH 

3620
02:13:24,796 --> 02:13:25,397
HERE. 

3621
02:13:25,397 --> 02:13:26,631
YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO GET 55 

3622
02:13:26,631 --> 02:13:26,864
VOTES. 

3623
02:13:26,864 --> 02:13:30,869
I DON'T KNOW, 54 OR 56 OR 57. 

3624
02:13:30,869 --> 02:13:34,239
THERE ARE 11 UNDECIDED SENATORS 

3625
02:13:34,239 --> 02:13:35,841
BEFORE THE HEARING. 

3626
02:13:35,841 --> 02:13:37,642
THREE OF THEM ARE REPUBLICANS. 

3627
02:13:37,642 --> 02:13:38,609
I LIKE YOUR CHANCES. 

3628
02:13:38,609 --> 02:13:45,684
EIGHT ARE DEMOCRAT. I JUST WANT 

3629
02:13:45,684 --> 02:13:46,885
YOU AND YOUR FAMILY TO KNOW 

3630
02:13:46,885 --> 02:13:47,719
THAT IN OTHER TIMES SOMEONE 

3631
02:13:47,719 --> 02:13:50,489
LIKE YOU WOULD PROBABLY GET 90 

3632
02:13:50,489 --> 02:13:54,126
VOTES. I WANT YOUR DAUGHTERS TO 

3633
02:13:54,126 --> 02:13:55,660
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY IS 

3634
02:13:55,660 --> 02:13:57,229
UNIQUE TO THE TIMES THAT WE 

3635
02:13:57,229 --> 02:13:58,930
LIVE IN. 

3636
02:13:58,930 --> 02:14:00,332
AND I WANT TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE 

3637
02:14:00,332 --> 02:14:01,766
TO SAY SOME THINGS TO THE 

3638
02:14:01,766 --> 02:14:03,034
PEOPLE THAT OF ATTENDED THIS 

3639
02:14:03,034 --> 02:14:04,302
HEARING. 

3640
02:14:04,302 --> 02:14:06,004
THERE IS A FATHER OF A PARKLAND 

3641
02:14:06,004 --> 02:14:09,341
STUDENT WHO WAS KILLED, I THINK 

3642
02:14:09,341 --> 02:14:10,675
THERE IS A MOTHER OF A CHILD 

3643
02:14:10,675 --> 02:14:12,444
WHO HAS TERRIBLE HEALTHCARE 

3644
02:14:12,444 --> 02:14:14,713
PROBLEMS, AND MANY OTHER PEOPLE 

3645
02:14:14,713 --> 02:14:18,984
HERE WITH PERSONAL SITUATIONS. 

3646
02:14:18,984 --> 02:14:20,619

REAL WORLD EFFECTS OF OUR

02:14:30,628 --> 02:14:34,666
DECISIONS. 

3652
02:14:34,666 --> 02:14:36,501
IN MY JOB AS A JUDGE FOR THE 

3653
02:14:36,501 --> 02:14:37,903
LAST 12 YEARS, I HAVE GONE OUT 

3654
02:14:37,903 --> 02:14:40,472
OF MY WAY IN MY OPINIONS AND AT 

3655
02:14:40,472 --> 02:14:43,375
ORAL ARGUMENTS TO MAKE CLEAR TO 

3656
02:14:43,375 --> 02:14:45,577
EVERYONE BEFORE ME THAT I 

3657
02:14:45,577 --> 02:14:48,847
UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION, THE 

3658
02:14:48,847 --> 02:14:50,982
CIRCUMSTANCES, THE FACTS. FOR 

3659
02:14:50,982 --> 02:14:54,119
EXAMPLE AS I WAS STAYING -- 

3660
02:14:54,119 --> 02:14:55,287
SAYING TO SENATOR FEINSTEIN  

3661
02:14:55,287 --> 02:15:03,628
EARLIER, AND I WANT TO REASSURE 

3662
02:15:03,628 --> 02:15:07,165
EVERYONE THAT I BASE MY 

3663
02:15:07,165 --> 02:15:08,900
DECISIONS ON THE LAW. 

3664
02:15:08,900 --> 02:15:10,835
BUT I DO SO WITH AN AWARENESS 

3665
02:15:10,835 --> 02:15:12,704
OF THE FACTS AND AN AWARENESS 

3666
02:15:12,704 --> 02:15:15,706
OF THE REAL WORLD CONSEQUENCES 

3667
02:15:15,706 --> 02:15:18,710
AND HAVE NOT LIVED IN A BUBBLE. 

3668
02:15:18,710 --> 02:15:19,744
AND I UNDERSTAND HOW 

3669
02:15:19,744 --> 02:15:22,981
PASSIONATELY PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT 

3670
02:15:22,981 --> 02:15:23,582
PARTICULAR ISSUES. 

3671
02:15:23,582 --> 02:15:24,949
AND I UNDERSTAND HOW PERSONALLY 

3672
02:15:24,949 --> 02:15:28,887
PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED BY ISSUES. 

3673
02:15:28,887 --> 02:15:32,724
AND I UNDERSTAND THE 

3674
02:15:32,724 --> 02:15:38,230
DIFFICULTIES THAT PEOPLE HAVE 

3675
02:15:38,230 --> 02:15:38,730
IN AMERICA. 

3676
02:15:38,730 --> 02:15:42,467
I UNDERSTAND, FOR EXAMPLE, -- 

3677
02:15:42,467 --> 02:15:44,803
TO START, I UNDERSTAND THE 

3678
02:15:44,803 --> 02:15:46,171
SITUATION OF HOMELESS PEOPLE. 

3679
02:15:46,171 --> 02:15:48,874
I SEE THEM ON A REGULAR BASHAN 

3680
02:15:48,874 --> 02:15:49,774
WHEN I AM SERVING MEALS. 

3681
02:15:49,774 --> 02:15:51,143
HE TELL ME ABOUT THAT. 

3682
02:15:51,143 --> 02:15:52,477
WHAT INDIRECTION YOU HAVE WITH 

3683
02:15:52,477 --> 02:15:54,445
HOMELESS PEOPLE? 

3684
02:15:54,445 --> 02:15:56,715
>> SENATOR, I REGULARLY SERVE 

3685
02:15:56,715 --> 02:15:58,650
MEALS WITH FATHER JOHN WHO IS 

3686
02:15:58,650 --> 02:16:02,387
THE HEAD OF CATHOLIC CHARITIES 

3687
02:16:02,387 --> 02:16:04,356
D.C. I'VE KNOWN HIM SINCE I WAS 

3688
02:16:04,356 --> 02:16:05,056
9 YEARS OLD. 

3689
02:16:05,056 --> 02:16:06,258
I WAS AN ALTAR BOY. 

3690
02:16:06,258 --> 02:16:12,764
AND WHAT YOU LEARN WHEN -- I 

3691
02:16:12,764 --> 02:16:15,233
TRY TO FOLLOW THE LESSON OF 

3692
02:16:15,233 --> 02:16:17,168
SERVING THE LEASE FORTUNATE 

3693
02:16:17,168 --> 02:16:18,837
AMONG US. 

3694
02:16:18,837 --> 02:16:22,274
I WAS HUNGRY, YOU GAVE ME FOOD. 

3695
02:16:22,274 --> 02:16:23,307
STRANGER, YOU WELCOME ME. 

3696
02:16:23,307 --> 02:16:26,144
SICK, AND YOU CARED FOR ME. 

3697
02:16:26,144 --> 02:16:31,516
SIX GROUPS THAT -- IS NOT 

3698
02:16:31,516 --> 02:16:33,251
EXCLUSIVE BUT THAT IS A GREAT 

3699
02:16:33,251 --> 02:16:34,686
PLACE TO START WITH YOUR 

3700
02:16:34,686 --> 02:16:35,085
PRIVATE TIME. 

3701
02:16:35,085 --> 02:16:38,623
>> DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENCE 

3702
02:16:38,623 --> 02:16:41,026
BETWEEN BRETT KAVANAUGH THE MAN 

3703
02:16:41,026 --> 02:16:42,761
AND  BRETT KAVANAUGH THE JUDGE. 

3704
02:16:42,761 --> 02:16:46,331
>> AS A MAN, I'M TRYING TO DO 

3705
02:16:46,331 --> 02:16:49,634
WHAT I CAN AND COMMUNITY 

3706
02:16:49,634 --> 02:16:51,335
SERVICE AS A DAD, A COACH, A 

3707
02:16:51,335 --> 02:16:57,642
HUSBAND, A VOLUNTEER. THE ONE 

3708
02:16:57,642 --> 02:17:00,412
THING YOU KNOW, WE ARE ALL GOD'S

3709
02:17:00,412 --> 02:17:01,446
CHILDREN. 

3710
02:17:01,446 --> 02:17:04,749
PEOPLE OF GOTTEN THERE BECAUSE 

3711
02:17:04,749 --> 02:17:06,250
MAYBE THEY HAVE A MENTAL 

3712
02:17:06,250 --> 02:17:08,620
ILLNESS, MAYBE THEY HAD A 

3713
02:17:08,620 --> 02:17:12,991
TERRIBLE FAMILY SITUATION, 

3714
02:17:12,991 --> 02:17:14,893
MAYBE THEY LOST A JOB AND HAD 

3715
02:17:14,893 --> 02:17:15,326
NO FAMILY. 

3716
02:17:15,326 --> 02:17:16,960
BUT EVERY PERSON YOU SERVE A 

3717
02:17:16,960 --> 02:17:19,964
MEAL TO IS JUST AS GOOD AS ME 

3718
02:17:19,964 --> 02:17:22,600
OR BETTER, FRANKLY, BECAUSE 

3719
02:17:22,600 --> 02:17:26,171
THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH THINGS 

3720
02:17:26,171 --> 02:17:28,906
JUST TO GET A MEAL ON A DAILY 

3721
02:17:28,906 --> 02:17:29,307
BASIS. 

3722
02:17:29,307 --> 02:17:31,308
AND YOU TALK TO THEM. 

3723
02:17:31,308 --> 02:17:32,277
THAT'S THE OTHER THING. 

3724
02:17:32,277 --> 02:17:33,077
WHEN YOU'RE WALKING BY THE 

3725
02:17:33,077 --> 02:17:35,179
STREET, YOU SEE PEOPLE -- AND I 

3726
02:17:35,179 --> 02:17:37,648
UNDERSTAND. 

3727
02:17:37,648 --> 02:17:38,683
I'M SURE I'VE DONE THIS. 

3728
02:17:38,683 --> 02:17:40,018
I DON'T WANT TO SOUND BETTER 

3729
02:17:40,018 --> 02:17:40,684
THAN SOMEONE DESCRIBING THIS 

3730
02:17:40,684 --> 02:17:42,320
BUT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY LOOK 

3731
02:17:42,320 --> 02:17:44,589
AND YOU DON'T SAY, HOW IS IT 

3732
02:17:44,589 --> 02:17:46,023
GOING. 

3733
02:17:46,023 --> 02:17:47,657
BUT WHEN YOU SERVE MEALS TO 

3734
02:17:47,657 --> 02:17:49,661
THEM, YOU TALK TO PEOPLE THAT 

3735
02:17:49,661 --> 02:17:49,994
ARE HOMELESS. 

3736
02:17:49,994 --> 02:17:53,832
AND THEY ARE JUST AS HUMAN AND 

3737
02:17:53,832 --> 02:17:56,134
JUST AS GOOD OF PEOPLE AS ALL 

3738
02:17:56,134 --> 02:17:59,571
OF US. WE ARE ALL PART OF ONE 

3739
02:17:59,571 --> 02:18:00,004
COMMUNITY. 

3740
02:18:00,004 --> 02:18:03,141
AND SO, I THINK ABOUT THAT. 

3741
02:18:03,141 --> 02:18:07,111
I DON'T WANT TO SOUND LIKE -- I 

3742
02:18:07,111 --> 02:18:08,847
CAN ALWAYS DO MORE AND MORE AND 

3743
02:18:08,847 --> 02:18:09,880
DO BETTER. 

3744
02:18:09,880 --> 02:18:10,548
I FALL SHORT. 

3745
02:18:10,548 --> 02:18:12,183
FATHER JOHN HAS BEEN A BIG 

3746
02:18:12,183 --> 02:18:13,218
INFLUENCE. 

3747
02:18:13,218 --> 02:18:14,619
THAT'S AS A PERSON. 

3748
02:18:14,619 --> 02:18:20,358
I TRY TO DO THAT. 

3749
02:18:20,358 --> 02:18:21,659
THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT 

3750
02:18:21,659 --> 02:18:22,059
SITUATION. 

3751
02:18:22,059 --> 02:18:24,596
THOSE ARE LOW INCOME BOYS FROM 

3752
02:18:24,596 --> 02:18:26,364
LOW INCOME FAMILIES. 

3753
02:18:26,364 --> 02:18:29,800
IT IS A TUITION FREE SCHOOL. 

3754
02:18:29,800 --> 02:18:33,304
I STARTED TUTORING UP THERE 

3755
02:18:33,304 --> 02:18:34,839
BECAUSE I WANTED TO DO SOME 

3756
02:18:34,839 --> 02:18:35,206
MORE TUTORING. 

3757
02:18:35,206 --> 02:18:37,142
AND JUST BE INVOLVED MORE. 

3758
02:18:37,142 --> 02:18:41,846
JUDGING IS IMPORTANT BUT I WANT 

3759
02:18:41,846 --> 02:18:43,181
TO BE MORE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN 

3760
02:18:43,181 --> 02:18:43,548
THE COMMUNITY. 

3761
02:18:43,548 --> 02:18:44,582
THEY HAD TUTORING. 

3762
02:18:44,582 --> 02:18:45,282
YOU DO HOMEWORK. 

3763
02:18:45,282 --> 02:18:47,218
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO HOME AND 

3764
02:18:47,218 --> 02:18:49,554
HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO DO. 

3765
02:18:49,554 --> 02:18:51,222
YOU HAVE THREE MEALS A DO YOUR 

3766
02:18:51,222 --> 02:18:51,489
HOMEWORK. 

3767
02:18:51,489 --> 02:18:53,558
AND YOU SEE THESE GREAT KIDS 

3768
02:18:53,558 --> 02:18:55,226
AND THEY ARE IN A STRUCTURED 

3769
02:18:55,226 --> 02:18:56,294
ENVIRONMENT. 

3770
02:18:56,294 --> 02:18:57,728
AND JAMAICAN EFFECT ON THEIR 

3771
02:18:57,728 --> 02:18:57,962
LIVES. 

3772
02:18:57,962 --> 02:19:00,298
AND LIKE I SAID YESTERDAY -- 

3773
02:19:00,298 --> 02:19:02,834
AND YOU MAKE AN EFFECT ON THEIR 

3774
02:19:02,834 --> 02:19:03,501
LIVES. 

3775
02:19:03,501 --> 02:19:05,770
AND LIKE I SAID YESTERDAY, FOR 

3776
02:19:05,770 --> 02:19:08,706
ME TO PARTICIPATE YOU CAN'T 

3777
02:19:08,706 --> 02:19:09,773
CHANGE EVERYTHING AT ONCE. 

3778
02:19:09,773 --> 02:19:11,909
BUT JUST CHANGING ONE LIFE, ONE 

3779
02:19:11,909 --> 02:19:17,915
MEAL, ONE DAY AT THE SHELTER 

3780
02:19:17,915 --> 02:19:18,916
AND ONE KID THAT REMEMBER 

3781
02:19:18,916 --> 02:19:20,218
SOMETHING THAT YOU SAID IN A 

3782
02:19:20,218 --> 02:19:20,618
TUTORING PROGRAM. 

3783
02:19:20,618 --> 02:19:24,088
IF WE ALL DID THAT MORE, AND I 

3784
02:19:24,088 --> 02:19:25,557
FALL SHORT TOO, AND I WANT TO 

3785
02:19:25,557 --> 02:19:27,058
DO MORE ON THAT FRONT, BUT YOU 

3786
02:19:27,058 --> 02:19:29,160
CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN 

3787
02:19:29,160 --> 02:19:32,730
PEOPLE'S LIVES. 

3788
02:19:32,730 --> 02:19:34,398
JUDGING IS BASED ON THE LAW BUT 

3789
02:19:34,398 --> 02:19:38,903
HOW DOES THAT AFFECT ME AS A 

3790
02:19:38,903 --> 02:19:39,136
JUDGE? 

3791
02:19:39,136 --> 02:19:40,572
FIRST OF ALL, JUST STANDING IN 

3792
02:19:40,572 --> 02:19:41,371
THE SHOES OF OTHERS. 

3793
02:19:41,371 --> 02:19:42,373
WE CAN ALL BE THAT HOMELESS 

3794
02:19:42,373 --> 02:19:42,674
PERSON. 

3795
02:19:42,674 --> 02:19:45,743
WE CAN BE THAT KID WHO NEEDS 

3796
02:19:45,743 --> 02:19:51,216
MORE STRUCTURED EDUCATIONAL 

3797
02:19:51,216 --> 02:19:52,317
ENVIRONMENTS. 

3798
02:19:52,317 --> 02:19:54,185
ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS TAUGHT 

3799
02:19:54,185 --> 02:19:56,888
BY MY MOM AND I REMEMBER MY SIX 

3800
02:19:56,888 --> 02:19:58,189
GRADE ENGLISH TEACHER IN 

3801
02:19:58,189 --> 02:20:01,426
RELIGION TEACHER AND COACH, ONE 

3802
02:20:01,426 --> 02:20:06,164
OF HIS -- AND HE DROVE ME TO 

3803
02:20:06,164 --> 02:20:06,397
SCHOOL. 

3804
02:20:06,397 --> 02:20:08,399
AND HE IS NOW ON THE BOARD OF 

3805
02:20:08,399 --> 02:20:12,069
THE ACADEMY WITH ME. 

3806
02:20:12,069 --> 02:20:13,471
BUT ONE OF HIS LESSONS WAS TO 

3807
02:20:13,471 --> 02:20:14,873
STAND IN THE SHOES OF OTHERS. 

3808
02:20:14,873 --> 02:20:17,008
AND I STILL HAVE THE TO KILL A 

3809
02:20:17,008 --> 02:20:18,877
MOCKINGBIRD THAT WE USED IN 

3810
02:20:18,877 --> 02:20:20,412
SIXTH GRADE. 

3811
02:20:20,412 --> 02:20:23,615
>> IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT YOUR 

3812
02:20:23,615 --> 02:20:25,116
JOB IS A JUDGE IS TO NOT SO 

3813
02:20:25,116 --> 02:20:26,251
MUCH STAND IN THE SHOES OF 

3814
02:20:26,251 --> 02:20:30,321
SOMEBODY YOU'RE SYMPATHETIC TO 

3815
02:20:30,321 --> 02:20:32,823
BUT STAND IN THE SHOES OF THE 

3816
02:20:32,823 --> 02:20:33,024
LAW? 

3817
02:20:33,024 --> 02:20:33,691
>> YOU ARE IN THE SHOES OF THE 

3818
02:20:33,691 --> 02:20:35,226
LAW BUT WITH AWARENESS OF 

3819
02:20:35,226 --> 02:20:37,228
DECISIONS. 

3820
02:20:37,228 --> 02:20:37,661
THAT'S THE CRITICAL 

3821
02:20:37,661 --> 02:20:37,995
DISTINCTION. 

3822
02:20:37,995 --> 02:20:39,897
YOU CAN'T BE UNAWARE WHEN YOU 

3823
02:20:39,897 --> 02:20:41,699
WRITE AN OPINION. 

3824
02:20:41,699 --> 02:20:43,635
HOW IS IT GOING TO AFFECT PEOPLE

3825
02:20:43,635 --> 02:20:45,369
X AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND AND 

3826
02:20:45,369 --> 02:20:48,306
EXPLAIN -- IS EXPLAINING. AND 

3827
02:20:48,306 --> 02:20:50,475
THEN WHEN PEOPLE COME INTO THE 

3828
02:20:50,475 --> 02:20:51,809
COURTROOM AND HOW YOU TREAT 

3829
02:20:51,809 --> 02:20:53,678
LITIGANTS. 

3830
02:20:53,678 --> 02:20:55,914
WE HAVE ALL BEEN IN COURTROOMS 

3831
02:20:55,914 --> 02:20:57,348
WHERE THE JUDGE IS ACTING A 

3832
02:20:57,348 --> 02:21:00,117
LITTLE TOO FULL OF BEING A 

3833
02:21:00,117 --> 02:21:02,620
JUDGE. 

3834
02:21:02,620 --> 02:21:07,458
AND TO -- WELL, WE HAVE ALL 

3835
02:21:07,458 --> 02:21:10,361
BEEN THERE. 

3836
02:21:10,361 --> 02:21:11,763
I TRY NOT TO DO THAT. 

3837
02:21:11,763 --> 02:21:13,097
I CAN'T SAY IMPERFECT BUT I TRY 

3838
02:21:13,097 --> 02:21:14,432
TO MAKE SURE THEY KNOW I GET 

3839
02:21:14,432 --> 02:21:14,632
IT. 

3840
02:21:14,632 --> 02:21:15,934
IF IT IS THE CRIMINAL DEFENDANT 

3841
02:21:15,934 --> 02:21:19,070
CASE, WE HAD A PRO SE CASE. 

3842
02:21:19,070 --> 02:21:22,707
A CASE WHERE THE LITIGANT COMES 

3843
02:21:22,707 --> 02:21:24,709
AND ARGUES IN OUR COURT WHICH 

3844
02:21:24,709 --> 02:21:26,177
REALLY HAPPENS. 

3845
02:21:26,177 --> 02:21:29,314
HAD IT WAS A GUY WHO SAID HE 

3846
02:21:29,314 --> 02:21:30,848
HAD BEEN CALLED THE LETTER AND 

3847
02:21:30,848 --> 02:21:45,196
WORD -- N WORD BY A SUPERVISOR. 

3848
02:21:45,196 --> 02:21:46,864
AND I WROTE A SEPARATE OPINION 

3849
02:21:46,864 --> 02:21:49,233
EXPLAINING YES, THE SINGLE 

3850
02:21:49,233 --> 02:21:51,769
INSTANCE DOES CONSTITUTE A 

3851
02:21:51,769 --> 02:21:54,405
RACIALLY HOSTILE WORK 

3852
02:21:54,405 --> 02:21:54,806
ENVIRONMENT. 

3853
02:21:54,806 --> 02:21:57,875
AND I EXPLAINED IN DOING THAT 

3854
02:21:57,875 --> 02:21:59,310
THE HISTORY OF RACISM IN THIS 

3855
02:21:59,310 --> 02:22:02,746
COUNTRY AND HOW THAT WORD -- NO 

3856
02:22:02,746 --> 02:22:05,316
OTHER WORD SO POWERFULLY CALLS 

3857
02:22:05,316 --> 02:22:08,253
TO MIND THE LONG AND BRUTAL 

3858
02:22:08,253 --> 02:22:10,188
STRUGGLE AGAINST RACISM. 

3859
02:22:10,188 --> 02:22:16,027
I WRITE -- BUT I WANTED TO MAKE 

3860
02:22:16,027 --> 02:22:18,996
CLEAR BY BRING THIS EXAMPLE OF 

3861
02:22:18,996 --> 02:22:22,066
THIS I UNDERSTOOD HIS 

3862
02:22:22,066 --> 02:22:22,366
SITUATION. 

3863
02:22:22,366 --> 02:22:23,901
I TRIED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT 

3864
02:22:23,901 --> 02:22:25,570
WOULD BE LIKE. 

3865
02:22:25,570 --> 02:22:26,904
I DECIDED THE CASE BASED ON THE 

3866
02:22:26,904 --> 02:22:30,074
LAW BUT I UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE 

3867
02:22:30,074 --> 02:22:33,211
POINT WAS. 

3868
02:22:33,211 --> 02:22:35,179
I WAS TRY TO BE AWARE OF THE 

3869
02:22:35,179 --> 02:22:35,947
FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. 

3870
02:22:35,947 --> 02:22:38,883
>> DID YOU EVER MAKE IT LEGAL 

3871
02:22:38,883 --> 02:22:39,717
DECISION THAT WAS PERSONALLY 

3872
02:22:39,717 --> 02:22:40,752
UPSETTING TO YOU? 

3873
02:22:40,752 --> 02:22:42,353
>> I'M SURE I HAVE. 

3874
02:22:42,353 --> 02:22:43,221
THAT'S WHAT JUSTICE KENNEDY 

3875
02:22:43,221 --> 02:22:45,489
TALKED ABOUT IN TEXAS VERSUS 

3876
02:22:45,489 --> 02:22:49,394
JOHNSON. 

3877
02:22:49,394 --> 02:22:51,663
THAT'S THE FLAGBURNING CASE. 

3878
02:22:51,663 --> 02:22:54,965
AND JUSTICE KENNEDY IS IN THE 

3879
02:22:54,965 --> 02:22:58,503
MINORITY. 

3880
02:22:58,503 --> 02:23:03,207
AND IT SAYS THAT A LAW AGAINST 

3881
02:23:03,207 --> 02:23:03,975
FLAGBURNING IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL 

3882
02:23:03,975 --> 02:23:06,110
UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT. 

3883
02:23:06,110 --> 02:23:08,746
THAT TOUR JUSTICE KENNEDY -- IT 

3884
02:23:08,746 --> 02:23:10,948
REALLY BOTHERED HIM. 

3885
02:23:10,948 --> 02:23:14,218
HE STILL RULED THE WAY HE DID 

3886
02:23:14,218 --> 02:23:15,253
BECAUSE HE READ THE FIRST 

3887
02:23:15,253 --> 02:23:16,788
AMENDMENT TO COMPEL THAT RESULT.

3888
02:23:16,788 --> 02:23:19,323
AND THAT CONCURRENCE IS SUCH A 

3889
02:23:19,323 --> 02:23:22,694
GREAT MODEL FOR JUDGING, AND A 

3890
02:23:22,694 --> 02:23:25,663
GREAT MODEL OF INDEPENDENCE AND 

3891
02:23:25,663 --> 02:23:28,132
A GREAT POINT TO WE FOLLOW THE 

3892
02:23:28,132 --> 02:23:33,838
LAW BUT WE ARE AWARE. 

3893
02:23:33,838 --> 02:23:34,439
WE ARE AWARE. 

3894
02:23:34,439 --> 02:23:35,573
AND YOU'RE BETTER JUDGE IF YOU 

3895
02:23:35,573 --> 02:23:35,973
ARE WHERE. 

3896
02:23:35,973 --> 02:23:38,142
>> I JUST WANT TO SAY THIS, 

3897
02:23:38,142 --> 02:23:42,380
EVERYTHING HE SAID I THINK HAS 

3898
02:23:42,380 --> 02:23:43,481
BEEN VERIFIED BY THE PEOPLE WHO 

3899
02:23:43,481 --> 02:23:44,282
KNOW HIM THE BEST. 

3900
02:23:44,282 --> 02:23:45,717
I CAN'T SAY I'VE READ 307 OF 

3901
02:23:45,717 --> 02:23:46,317
YOUR OPINIONS. 

3902
02:23:46,317 --> 02:23:47,752
I CAN TELL YOU, I HAVE NOT. 

3903
02:23:47,752 --> 02:23:54,292
I DID NOT READ SOME OF THESE 

3904
02:23:54,292 --> 02:23:56,094
BUT WHAT I CHOSE TO DO IS LOOK 

3905
02:23:56,094 --> 02:23:57,729
AT THE PEOPLE WHO KNEW HIM THE 

3906
02:23:57,729 --> 02:23:57,929
BEST. 

3907
02:23:57,929 --> 02:23:59,497
AND I THINK BOB BENNETT WHO 

3908
02:23:59,497 --> 02:24:03,267
DEFENDED PRESIDENT CLINTON SAID 

3909
02:24:03,267 --> 02:24:08,473
THAT HE IS A JUDGES JUDGE. 

3910
02:24:08,473 --> 02:24:09,706
SOMEBODY DOING HIS BEST TO 

3911
02:24:09,706 --> 02:24:11,542
FOLLOW HIS LOT RATHER THAN HIS 

3912
02:24:11,542 --> 02:24:16,180
PREFERENCES. 

3913
02:24:16,180 --> 02:24:17,415
HE IS AN ALL-STAR IN HIS 

3914
02:24:17,415 --> 02:24:18,216
PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL LIFE. 

3915
02:24:18,216 --> 02:24:19,717
I'VE YET TO FIND ANYBODY THAT I 

3916
02:24:19,717 --> 02:24:20,451
FIND CREDIBLE, REALLY ANYBODY 

3917
02:24:20,451 --> 02:24:25,356
AT ALL THAT WAS ADJUST TO THE 

3918
02:24:25,356 --> 02:24:28,359
FACT THAT YOU ARE UNFAIR TO 

3919
02:24:28,359 --> 02:24:30,862
LITIGANTS. 

3920
02:24:30,862 --> 02:24:33,264
BUT YOU ARE A REPUBLICAN. 

3921
02:24:33,264 --> 02:24:34,365
IS THAT TRUE? 

3922
02:24:34,365 --> 02:24:37,768
>> I REGISTER -- 

3923
02:24:37,768 --> 02:24:40,304
>> WAS, OKAY. 

3924
02:24:40,304 --> 02:24:41,372
>> YES. 

3925
02:24:41,372 --> 02:24:42,807
>> I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU SAY 

3926
02:24:42,807 --> 02:24:43,074
THAT. 

3927
02:24:43,074 --> 02:24:44,442
IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. 

3928
02:24:44,442 --> 02:24:46,077
GIVEN WE WORK FOR. 

3929
02:24:46,077 --> 02:24:50,748
>> I WILL LET YOU FINISH YOUR 

3930
02:24:50,748 --> 02:24:51,115
QUESTION. 

3931
02:24:51,115 --> 02:24:52,950
YOU WORK FOR A LOT OF 

3932
02:24:52,950 --> 02:24:53,618
REPUBLICANS. 

3933
02:24:53,618 --> 02:24:53,851
>> YES. 

3934
02:24:53,851 --> 02:24:56,654
>> PRESIDENT BUSH, I WORKED 

3935
02:24:56,654 --> 02:24:57,355
FOR. 

3936
02:24:57,355 --> 02:24:57,622
YES. 

3937
02:24:57,622 --> 02:25:01,492
>> THAT IS ALL FINE. 

3938
02:25:01,492 --> 02:25:14,639
>> SO, I REMEMBER -- [ CROWD 

3939
02:25:14,639 --> 02:25:17,542
CHANTING ] SO I ASKED ABOUT A 

3940
02:25:17,542 --> 02:25:24,048
STATEMENT THAT GREG CRAIG MADE. 

3941
02:25:24,048 --> 02:25:25,349
DO YOU KNOW HIM BY ANY CHANCE? 

3942
02:25:25,349 --> 02:25:26,350
>> I HAVE MET HIM. 

3943
02:25:26,350 --> 02:25:27,485
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN MANY 

3944
02:25:27,485 --> 02:25:27,785
YEARS. 

3945
02:25:27,785 --> 02:25:29,453
>> HE WAS THE DEFENDER OF 

3946
02:25:29,453 --> 02:25:30,988
PRESIDENT CLINTON DURING THE 

3947
02:25:30,988 --> 02:25:34,692
IMPEACHMENT HEARING AND 

3948
02:25:34,692 --> 02:25:37,461
SOMEWHERE IN HERE, I HAVE HIS 

3949
02:25:37,461 --> 02:25:42,099
STATEMENT ABOUT KAGAN. 

3950
02:25:42,099 --> 02:25:43,367
>> NO. 

3951
02:25:43,367 --> 02:25:47,138
I'M LOOKING FOR THIS STATEMENT. 

3952
02:25:47,138 --> 02:25:47,605
HERE WE GO. 

3953
02:25:47,605 --> 02:25:53,244
HERE IS WHAT -- HE WAS A 

3954
02:25:53,244 --> 02:25:57,281
PROGRESSIVE IN THE MOLD OF 

3955
02:25:57,281 --> 02:26:00,985
OBAMA HIMSELF. 

3956
02:26:00,985 --> 02:26:02,220
IT COMES FROM THE PROGRESSIVE 

3957
02:26:02,220 --> 02:26:03,020
SIDE OF THE SPECTRUM ACCORDING 

3958
02:26:03,020 --> 02:26:05,322
TO RONALD KLEIN, THE FIRST WAS 

3959
02:26:05,322 --> 02:26:08,658
GREG CRICK. I HAD AN EXCHANGE 

3960
02:26:08,658 --> 02:26:11,963
WITH THE JUSTICE WHEN SHE WAS 

3961
02:26:11,963 --> 02:26:14,632
THE NOMINEE. 

3962
02:26:14,632 --> 02:26:20,705
I'M NOT TRYING TO TRICK YOU. HE 

3963
02:26:20,705 --> 02:26:22,006
SAID YOU ARE LARGELY 

3964
02:26:22,006 --> 02:26:23,307
PROGRESSIVE. 

3965
02:26:23,307 --> 02:26:27,411
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT. 

3966
02:26:27,411 --> 02:26:29,547
SENATOR GRAHAM, YOU KNOW I HAVE 

3967
02:26:29,547 --> 02:26:31,816
BEEN A DEMOCRAT ALL MY LIFE. 

3968
02:26:31,816 --> 02:26:37,455
I WORK FOR 2 DEMOCRATIC 

3969
02:26:37,455 --> 02:26:37,755
PRESIDENTS. 

3970
02:26:37,755 --> 02:26:39,056
THAT'S WHAT MY POLITICAL VIEWS 

3971
02:26:39,056 --> 02:26:39,624
ARE. 

3972
02:26:39,624 --> 02:26:41,092
WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOUR 

3973
02:26:41,092 --> 02:26:43,261
POLITICAL VIEWS PROGRESSIVE? 

3974
02:26:43,261 --> 02:26:46,130
MISS KAGAN, MY VIEWS ARE 

3975
02:26:46,130 --> 02:26:48,900
GENERALLY  PROGRESSIVE. WHICH 

3976
02:26:48,900 --> 02:26:51,402
IS TRUE. 

3977
02:26:51,402 --> 02:26:53,837
I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT SHE 

3978
02:26:53,837 --> 02:26:59,276
SAID BECAUSE I EXPECT PRESIDENT 

3979
02:26:59,276 --> 02:27:03,948
OBAMA TO GO TO SOMEONE LIKE 

3980
02:27:03,948 --> 02:27:04,982
KAGAN WHO IS PROGRESSIVE AND 

3981
02:27:04,982 --> 02:27:06,617
SHARES HIS GENERAL  VIEW OF 

3982
02:27:06,617 --> 02:27:11,522
JUDGING, AND HAVE -- HAPPENED 

3983
02:27:11,522 --> 02:27:14,759
TO BE HIGHLY QUALIFIED. 

3984
02:27:14,759 --> 02:27:18,262
HE WANTED SOMEONE WHOSE 

3985
02:27:18,262 --> 02:27:21,666
PHILOSOPHY OF JUDGING WAS HIS. 

3986
02:27:21,666 --> 02:27:26,237
WHICH IS APPLIED TO THE LAW AND 

3987
02:27:26,237 --> 02:27:43,221
CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES. 

3988
02:27:43,221 --> 02:27:52,363
>>I EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN. 

3989
02:27:52,363 --> 02:27:53,865
TO MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER 

3990
02:27:53,865 --> 02:27:57,234
SIDE, WHAT DO YOU REALLY EXPECT?

3991
02:27:57,234 --> 02:27:59,036
YOU SHOULD CELEBRATE EVEN 

3992
02:27:59,036 --> 02:28:03,074
THOUGH YOU DON'T VOTE FOR HIM 

3993
02:28:03,074 --> 02:28:04,308
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU 

3994
02:28:04,308 --> 02:28:05,409
WOULDN'T, THE QUALITY OF THE 

3995
02:28:05,409 --> 02:28:08,346
MAN CHOSEN BY PRESIDENT OBAMA. 

3996
02:28:08,346 --> 02:28:10,648
KAGAN AND SOTOMAYOR  CAME FROM 

3997
02:28:10,648 --> 02:28:12,984
THE PROGRESSIVE WING OF THE 

3998
02:28:12,984 --> 02:28:15,486
JUDGING WORLD AND OF LEGAL 

3999
02:28:15,486 --> 02:28:16,287
THOUGHT. 

4000
02:28:16,287 --> 02:28:22,159
THEY ARE HOLY -- HIGHLY 

4001
02:28:22,159 --> 02:28:24,929
QUALIFIED PEOPLE. 

4002
02:28:24,929 --> 02:28:27,231
LET'S SEE IF I CAN GET THE VOTE 

4003
02:28:27,231 --> 02:28:29,500
TOTALS. 

4004
02:28:29,500 --> 02:28:31,202
KAGAN GOT 63 VOTES AND  

4005
02:28:31,202 --> 02:28:33,437
STOUDEMIRE GOT 68. 

4006
02:28:33,437 --> 02:28:35,306
IT'S GOING TO BOTHER ME THAT 

4007
02:28:35,306 --> 02:28:36,741
YOU DON'T GET THOSE NUMBERS. 

4008
02:28:36,741 --> 02:28:38,743
WHAT BOTHERS ME IS THEY 

4009
02:28:38,743 --> 02:28:40,811
SHOULD'VE GOTTEN 90. THEY 

4010
02:28:40,811 --> 02:28:41,812
SHOULD'VE GOTTEN 95. 

4011
02:28:41,812 --> 02:28:47,718
ANTHONY KENNEDY GOT 97. 

4012
02:28:47,718 --> 02:28:51,022
ANTHONY SCALIA GOT 98. 

4013
02:28:51,022 --> 02:28:55,192
RUTH BADER GINSBURG GOT 96. 

4014
02:28:55,192 --> 02:28:56,027
SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED? 

4015
02:28:56,027 --> 02:28:59,763
BETWEEN THEN AND NOW, ADVISING 

4016
02:28:59,763 --> 02:29:01,365
CONSENT HAS TAKEN ON A 

4017
02:29:01,365 --> 02:29:02,433
DIFFERENT MEANING. 

4018
02:29:02,433 --> 02:29:04,368
IT USED TO BE THE UNDERSTANDING 

4019
02:29:04,368 --> 02:29:06,637
OF THIS BODY THAT ELECTIONS 

4020
02:29:06,637 --> 02:29:07,671
HAVE CONSEQUENCES AND YOU WOULD 

4021
02:29:07,671 --> 02:29:12,243
EXPECT THE PRESIDENT WHO WON 

4022
02:29:12,243 --> 02:29:13,143
THE ELECTION TO SELECT SOMEBODY 

4023
02:29:13,143 --> 02:29:15,312
OF THEIR PHILOSOPHY. 

4024
02:29:15,312 --> 02:29:18,950
I PROMISE YOU WHEN HE VOTED, HE 

4025
02:29:18,950 --> 02:29:20,518
DID NOT AGREE WITH HER LEGAL 

4026
02:29:20,518 --> 02:29:21,886
PHILOSOPHY. 

4027
02:29:21,886 --> 02:29:23,521
AND I DOUBT IF SENATOR LEE 

4028
02:29:23,521 --> 02:29:27,324
AGREED WITH JUSTICE SCALIA. 

4029
02:29:27,324 --> 02:29:29,193
SENATOR LEE HAS VOTED FOR A LOT 

4030
02:29:29,193 --> 02:29:29,727
OF REPUBLICANS. 

4031
02:29:29,727 --> 02:29:31,161
I HAVE VOTED FOR EVERYONE 

4032
02:29:31,161 --> 02:29:33,898
PRESENTED SINCE I HAVE BEEN HERE

4033
02:29:33,898 --> 02:29:35,699
BECAUSE I FIND THEM TO BE 

4034
02:29:35,699 --> 02:29:38,369
HIGHLY QUALIFIED, COMING FROM 

4035
02:29:38,369 --> 02:29:40,604
BACKGROUNDS I WOULD EXPECT THE 

4036
02:29:40,604 --> 02:29:48,312
PRESIDENT IN QUESTION TO CHOOSE 

4037
02:29:48,312 --> 02:29:48,512
FROM. 

4038
02:29:48,512 --> 02:29:49,380
SO AS TO YOUR QUALIFICATIONS, 

4039
02:29:49,380 --> 02:29:51,215
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN A JUDGE? 

4040
02:29:51,215 --> 02:29:54,285
>> I HAVE BEEN A JUDGE FOR 12 

4041
02:29:54,285 --> 02:29:54,518
YEARS. 

4042
02:29:54,518 --> 02:29:55,619
>> HOW MANY OPINIONS HAVE YOU 

4043
02:29:55,619 --> 02:29:56,020
WRITTEN? 

4044
02:29:56,020 --> 02:29:57,688
>> I HAVE WRITTEN OVER 300 

4045
02:29:57,688 --> 02:29:57,954
OPINIONS. 

4046
02:29:57,954 --> 02:29:58,789
>> OKAY. 

4047
02:29:58,789 --> 02:30:00,391
DO YOU THINK THERE IS A LOT WE 

4048
02:30:00,391 --> 02:30:01,525
CAN LEARN FROM THOSE OPINIONS 

4049
02:30:01,525 --> 02:30:02,893
IF WE LOOK AT THEM? 

4050
02:30:02,893 --> 02:30:05,696
>> YES. 

4051
02:30:05,696 --> 02:30:08,232
I'M VERY PROUD OF MY OPINIONS. 

4052
02:30:08,232 --> 02:30:09,667
AS I MENTIONED, I TELL PEOPLE 

4053
02:30:09,667 --> 02:30:10,901
DON'T JUST READ ABOUT THE 

4054
02:30:10,901 --> 02:30:13,904
OPINIONS, READ THE OPINIONS. 

4055
02:30:13,904 --> 02:30:14,505
I'M PROUD OF THEM. 

4056
02:30:14,505 --> 02:30:15,606
>> YOU WERE NOMINATED BY 

4057
02:30:15,606 --> 02:30:17,140
PRESIDENT TRUMP ON JULY 9. MY 

4058
02:30:17,140 --> 02:30:18,676
BIRTHDAY. 

4059
02:30:18,676 --> 02:30:20,111
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A GOOD 

4060
02:30:20,111 --> 02:30:26,283
BIRTHDAY PRESENT AT -- AND I 

4061
02:30:26,283 --> 02:30:27,952
MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH 

4062
02:30:27,952 --> 02:30:28,853
IT. 

4063
02:30:28,853 --> 02:30:32,189
BY 9:23, CHUCK SCHUMER SAYS I 

4064
02:30:32,189 --> 02:30:35,593
WILL OPPOSE JUDGE KAVANAUGH.  

4065
02:30:35,593 --> 02:30:40,031
BY 9:25, JUDGE KAVANAUGH  

4066
02:30:40,031 --> 02:30:44,201
REPRESENTS A FUNDAMENTAL THREAT 

4067
02:30:44,201 --> 02:30:44,601
OF AMERICANS. 

4068
02:30:44,601 --> 02:30:46,403
I WILL OPPOSE THE NOMINATION. 

4069
02:30:46,403 --> 02:30:50,608
ELIZABETH WORN AT 9:55, HIS 

4070
02:30:50,608 --> 02:30:54,744
RECORD IS CLEAR AND HOSTILE TO 

4071
02:30:54,744 --> 02:31:01,819
HEALTHCARE. 

4072
02:31:01,819 --> 02:31:02,753
HE THINKS PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 

4073
02:31:02,753 --> 02:31:03,254
ABOVE THE LAW. 

4074
02:31:03,254 --> 02:31:05,522
ON AND ON AND ON. 

4075
02:31:05,522 --> 02:31:09,360
BERNIE SANDERS AT 10:18. 

4076
02:31:09,360 --> 02:31:10,794
IF BRETT KAVANAUGH IS 

4077
02:31:10,794 --> 02:31:12,062
CONFIRMED,  IT WILL HAVE 

4078
02:31:12,062 --> 02:31:14,698
PROFOUNDLY NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON 

4079
02:31:14,698 --> 02:31:18,302
RIGHTS. 

4080
02:31:18,302 --> 02:31:20,771
ALL I CAN SAY WITHIN AN HOUR 

4081
02:31:20,771 --> 02:31:23,173
AND 18 MINUTES OF YOUR 

4082
02:31:23,173 --> 02:31:25,576
NOMINATION, YOU BECAME THE 

4083
02:31:25,576 --> 02:31:33,317
BIGGEST THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. 

4084
02:31:33,317 --> 02:31:34,919
IN THE EYES OF SOME OF THE MOST 

4085
02:31:34,919 --> 02:31:35,953
PARTISAN PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY, 

4086
02:31:35,953 --> 02:31:38,856
WHO WOULD HOLD KAGAN AND 

4087
02:31:38,856 --> 02:31:39,957
STOUDEMIRE UP AS HIGHLY 

4088
02:31:39,957 --> 02:31:41,157
QUALIFIED AND WOULD CHALLENGE 

4089
02:31:41,157 --> 02:31:45,529
ANY WHO VOTE AGAINST THEM. 

4090
02:31:45,529 --> 02:31:48,999
YOU LIVE IN UNUSUAL TIMES. 

4091
02:31:48,999 --> 02:31:50,334
YOU SHOULD GET MORE THAN 90 

4092
02:31:50,334 --> 02:31:52,036
VOTES BUT YOU WON'T. 

4093
02:31:52,036 --> 02:31:54,538
AND I'M SORRY IT HAS GOTTEN TO 

4094
02:31:54,538 --> 02:31:55,139
WHERE IT HAS. 

4095
02:31:55,139 --> 02:31:58,175
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO ABOUT YOU. 

4096
02:31:58,175 --> 02:32:02,746
IF YOU DON'T MIND, WHAT DID YOU 

4097
02:32:02,746 --> 02:32:08,352
TELL YOUR CHILDREN YESTERDAY? 

4098
02:32:08,352 --> 02:32:12,189
ABOUT THE HEARING? 

4099
02:32:12,189 --> 02:32:19,230
>> I WILL TELL THEM WHAT THEY 

4100
02:32:19,230 --> 02:32:20,664
TOLD ME. 

4101
02:32:20,664 --> 02:32:22,199
THEY GAVE ME A BIG HUG AND SAID 

4102
02:32:22,199 --> 02:32:22,700
GOOD JOB, DADDY. 

4103
02:32:22,700 --> 02:32:24,001
MARGARET BEFORE SHE WENT TO BED 

4104
02:32:24,001 --> 02:32:26,003
MADE A SPECIAL TRIP DOWN AND 

4105
02:32:26,003 --> 02:32:27,538
GAVE ME A SPECIAL HUG. 

4106
02:32:27,538 --> 02:32:30,974
I JUST WISH IF WE COULD HAVE A 

4107
02:32:30,974 --> 02:32:35,246
HEARING WHERE THE NOMINEES KIDS 

4108
02:32:35,246 --> 02:32:36,880
CAN SHOW UP. 

4109
02:32:36,880 --> 02:32:40,451
IS THAT ASKING TOO MUCH? 

4110
02:32:40,451 --> 02:32:42,185
SO WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY HAVE WE 

4111
02:32:42,185 --> 02:32:49,426
BECOME? NONE OF THIS HAPPENED 

4112
02:32:49,426 --> 02:32:50,527
JUST A FEW YEARS AGO. 

4113
02:32:50,527 --> 02:32:51,762
IT IS GETTING WORSE AND WORSE 

4114
02:32:51,762 --> 02:32:52,062
AND WORSE. 

4115
02:32:52,062 --> 02:32:53,497
AND ALL OF US HAVE AN 

4116
02:32:53,497 --> 02:32:56,934
OBLIGATION TO TRY TO CORRECT IT.

4117
02:32:56,934 --> 02:32:59,269
ROE V. WADE,  ARE YOU FAMILIAR 

4118
02:32:59,269 --> 02:33:01,372
WITH THE CASE? 

4119
02:33:01,372 --> 02:33:02,306
>> I AM, SENATOR. 

4120
02:33:02,306 --> 02:33:04,908
[ LAUGHTER ] 

4121
02:33:04,908 --> 02:33:06,944
>> CAN YOU AND 30 SECONDS GAVE 

4122
02:33:06,944 --> 02:33:08,779
ME THE GENERAL HOLDING OF ROE 

4123
02:33:08,779 --> 02:33:09,847
V. WADE? 

4124
02:33:09,847 --> 02:33:13,450
>>  AS ELABORATED UPON, A WOMAN 

4125
02:33:13,450 --> 02:33:16,387
HAS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT AS 

4126
02:33:16,387 --> 02:33:17,521
INTERPRETED BY THE COURT IN THE 

4127
02:33:17,521 --> 02:33:18,789
CONSTITUTION TO OBTAIN AN 

4128
02:33:18,789 --> 02:33:21,158
ABORTION UP TO THE POINT OF 

4129
02:33:21,158 --> 02:33:24,361
VIABILITY, SUBJECT TO REASONABLE

4130
02:33:24,361 --> 02:33:25,762
REGULATIONS BY THE STATE AS 

4131
02:33:25,762 --> 02:33:27,064
SOON AS THOSE REGULATIONS DO 

4132
02:33:27,064 --> 02:33:29,733
NOT CONSTITUTE AN UNDUE BURDEN 

4133
02:33:29,733 --> 02:33:31,335
ON THE WOMAN'S RIGHT. 

4134
02:33:31,335 --> 02:33:35,205
>> AS TO HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS, 

4135
02:33:35,205 --> 02:33:38,642
CAN YOU SIT DOWN WITH FOUR OTHER

4136
02:33:38,642 --> 02:33:41,278
JUDGES AND OVERRULE ROE V. WADE 

4137
02:33:41,278 --> 02:33:43,314
JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT TO. 

4138
02:33:43,314 --> 02:33:45,282
>> ROE V. WADE IS AN IMPORTANT  

4139
02:33:45,282 --> 02:33:45,582
PRECEDENT. 

4140
02:33:45,582 --> 02:33:49,420
>> YOU JUST CAN'T -- WHAT ARE 

4141
02:33:49,420 --> 02:33:50,788
YOU DOING FOR LUNCH? 

4142
02:33:50,788 --> 02:33:53,090
LET'S OVERRULE ROE V. WADE. 

4143
02:33:53,090 --> 02:33:55,125
IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.  

4144
02:33:55,125 --> 02:33:56,694
I SEE WHAT YOU'RE ASKING, 

4145
02:33:56,694 --> 02:33:57,761
SENATOR. 

4146
02:33:57,761 --> 02:33:59,196
THE WAY CASES COME UP TO US IN 

4147
02:33:59,196 --> 02:34:02,232
THAT CONTEXT OR OTHERS WOULD BE 

4148
02:34:02,232 --> 02:34:02,432
-- 

4149
02:34:02,432 --> 02:34:07,303
>> TONIGHT BE -- CAN I GIVE AN 

4150
02:34:07,303 --> 02:34:10,107
EXAMPLE? 

4151
02:34:10,107 --> 02:34:10,541
>> YES. 

4152
02:34:10,541 --> 02:34:11,942
SOME STATES SUMMER PASSES A LAW 

4153
02:34:11,942 --> 02:34:13,377
THAT RUNS INTO THE FACE AND 

4154
02:34:13,377 --> 02:34:14,812
SOMEBODY WILL OBJECT AND GO TO 

4155
02:34:14,812 --> 02:34:18,048
THE LOWER COURTS AND EVENTUALLY 

4156
02:34:18,048 --> 02:34:19,616
MIGHT COME TO THE SUPREME COURT 

4157
02:34:19,616 --> 02:34:22,920
CHALLENGING THE FOUNDATIONS OF 

4158
02:34:22,920 --> 02:34:23,621
ROE V. WADE. 

4159
02:34:23,621 --> 02:34:26,690
IT WOULD TAKE A LEGISLATION OF  

4160
02:34:26,690 --> 02:34:28,025
ENACTMENT FOR THAT TO HAPPEN? 

4161
02:34:28,025 --> 02:34:28,859
>> THAT'S CORRECT. 

4162
02:34:28,859 --> 02:34:30,560
IF THERE WAS SUCH AN ACTION 

4163
02:34:30,560 --> 02:34:37,568
CHALLENGING ROE V. WADE  AND IT 

4164
02:34:37,568 --> 02:34:38,602
CAME BEFORE THE COURT, WOULD 

4165
02:34:38,602 --> 02:34:39,403
YOU LISTEN TO BOTH SIDES? 

4166
02:34:39,403 --> 02:34:40,804
>> I LISTEN TO BOTH SIDES IN 

4167
02:34:40,804 --> 02:34:41,705
EVERY CASE, SENATOR. 

4168
02:34:41,705 --> 02:34:42,606
I HAVE FOR 12 YEARS. 

4169
02:34:42,606 --> 02:34:42,940
YES. 

4170
02:34:42,940 --> 02:34:48,712
>> WHEN IT COMES TO OVERRULING, 

4171
02:34:48,712 --> 02:34:48,979
ANALYSIS? 

4172
02:34:48,979 --> 02:34:51,882
>> SO, FIRST OF ALL, YOU START 

4173
02:34:51,882 --> 02:34:54,318
WITH THE NOTION OF PRECEDENT. 

4174
02:34:54,318 --> 02:34:56,654
AND IF I SAID TO SENATOR 

4175
02:34:56,654 --> 02:35:00,524
FEINSTEIN,  THIS IS BEEN 

4176
02:35:00,524 --> 02:35:01,892
REAFFIRMED MANY TIMES OVER 45 

4177
02:35:01,892 --> 02:35:06,664
YEARS INCLUDED IN PLANNED 

4178
02:35:06,664 --> 02:35:10,701
PARENTHOOD VERSUS CASEY.  

4179
02:35:10,701 --> 02:35:12,669
THAT IMPORTANTLY BECAME 

4180
02:35:12,669 --> 02:35:15,939
PRESIDENT ON PRECEDENT -- 

4181
02:35:15,939 --> 02:35:18,776
PRECEDENT ON PRECEDENT. 

4182
02:35:18,776 --> 02:35:19,810
THERE ARE FACTORS YOU LOOK AT 

4183
02:35:19,810 --> 02:35:21,010
WHEN YOU'RE CONSIDERING ANY 

4184
02:35:21,010 --> 02:35:22,012
PRECEDENT. 

4185
02:35:22,012 --> 02:35:25,282
>> SO THERE IS A PROFIT -- 

4186
02:35:25,282 --> 02:35:27,818
PROCESS IN PLACE? 

4187
02:35:27,818 --> 02:35:28,519
IS THAT CORRECT? 

4188
02:35:28,519 --> 02:35:29,652
>> THAT IS CORRECT. 

4189
02:35:29,652 --> 02:35:33,657
>> IF SOMEBODY SAID CITIZENS 

4190
02:35:33,657 --> 02:35:34,858
UNITED HAS BEEN HARMFUL TO THE 

4191
02:35:34,858 --> 02:35:37,694
COUNTRY, AND MADE A RECORD THAT 

4192
02:35:37,694 --> 02:35:40,030
THE EFFECTS OF CITIZENS UNITED 

4193
02:35:40,030 --> 02:35:42,833
HAS EMPOWERED ABOUT 20 OR 30 

4194
02:35:42,833 --> 02:35:44,001
PEOPLE TO RUN ALL THE ELECTIONS 

4195
02:35:44,001 --> 02:35:45,535
IN SOME STATE OR LOCALITY 

4196
02:35:45,535 --> 02:35:48,672
SOMEWHERE AND PASSED A BEEN ON 

4197
02:35:48,672 --> 02:35:52,509
SOFT MONEY, AND IT GOT TO THE 

4198
02:35:52,509 --> 02:35:53,310
COURT, WOULD YOU AT LEAST 

4199
02:35:53,310 --> 02:35:56,780
LISTEN TO THE ARGUMENT THAT 

4200
02:35:56,780 --> 02:35:58,549
THEY NEED TO BE REVISITED? 

4201
02:35:58,549 --> 02:35:59,616
>> OF COURSE. 

4202
02:35:59,616 --> 02:36:01,418
I LISTEN TO ALL ARGUMENTS. 

4203
02:36:01,418 --> 02:36:04,888
YOU HAVE AN OPEN MIND. 

4204
02:36:04,888 --> 02:36:06,023
YOU GET THE BRIEFS AND 

4205
02:36:06,023 --> 02:36:06,356
ARGUMENTS. 

4206
02:36:06,356 --> 02:36:07,857
SOME ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS. 

4207
02:36:07,857 --> 02:36:09,926
PRECEDENT IS CRITICALLY 

4208
02:36:09,926 --> 02:36:13,297
IMPORTANT. BUT YOU LISTEN TO 

4209
02:36:13,297 --> 02:36:13,664
ALL ARGUMENTS. 

4210
02:36:13,664 --> 02:36:16,200
>> OKAY. 

4211
02:36:16,200 --> 02:36:17,401
WHERE WERE YOU ON SEPTEMBER 11, 

4212
02:36:17,401 --> 02:36:17,601
2001? 

4213
02:36:17,601 --> 02:36:23,173
>> I WAS IN MY DEN OFFICE 

4214
02:36:23,173 --> 02:36:23,574
INITIALLY. 

4215
02:36:23,574 --> 02:36:29,480
AND THEN AFTER THE FIRST CALL, 

4216
02:36:29,480 --> 02:36:30,881
I WAS IN THE COUNCILS OFFICE 

4217
02:36:30,881 --> 02:36:33,917
FOR THE NEXT FEW MINUTES. 

4218
02:36:33,917 --> 02:36:39,656
THEN WE WERE ALL TOLD TO GO 

4219
02:36:39,656 --> 02:36:41,325
DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE WEST 

4220
02:36:41,325 --> 02:36:42,993
WING. 

4221
02:36:42,993 --> 02:36:45,262
AND THEN WE WERE ALL EVACUATED. 

4222
02:36:45,262 --> 02:36:48,298
I THINK THAT THOUGHT WAS FLIGHT 

4223
02:36:48,298 --> 02:36:49,900
93 MIGHT'VE BEEN HEADED FOR THE 

4224
02:36:49,900 --> 02:36:52,035
WHITE HOUSE AND HEADED HERE. 

4225
02:36:52,035 --> 02:36:54,671
AND SECRET SERVICE WAS HUSTLING 

4226
02:36:54,671 --> 02:36:55,906
US OUT. 

4227
02:36:55,906 --> 02:36:58,909
AND THEN PANIC. THEY STARTED 

4228
02:36:58,909 --> 02:37:01,311
SCREAMING AT US. 

4229
02:37:01,311 --> 02:37:03,747
SPRINT, RON! 

4230
02:37:03,747 --> 02:37:10,621
-- RUN! 

4231
02:37:10,621 --> 02:37:12,723
MY WIFE WAS A FEW STEPS AHEAD 

4232
02:37:12,723 --> 02:37:12,956
OF ME. 

4233
02:37:12,956 --> 02:37:16,727
WE SPRINTED OUT. 

4234
02:37:16,727 --> 02:37:17,861
SHE WAS WEARING A BLACK AND 

4235
02:37:17,861 --> 02:37:18,428
WHITE SHIRT. 

4236
02:37:18,428 --> 02:37:19,663
AND I REMEMBER WE SPRINTED OUT 

4237
02:37:19,663 --> 02:37:20,464
THE FRONT GATE INTO LAFAYETTE 

4238
02:37:20,464 --> 02:37:23,834
PARK KIND OF. 

4239
02:37:23,834 --> 02:37:27,771
NO IPHONES OR ANYTHING LIKE 

4240
02:37:27,771 --> 02:37:27,971
THAT. 

4241
02:37:27,971 --> 02:37:29,473
THE CELL PHONES DIDN'T WORK. 

4242
02:37:29,473 --> 02:37:31,240
WE WERE JUST ALL KIND OF OUT 

4243
02:37:31,240 --> 02:37:32,576
THERE. 

4244
02:37:32,576 --> 02:37:36,647
I REMEMBER SOMEHOW, ENDING UP 

4245
02:37:36,647 --> 02:37:38,482
SEEING ON TV ON CONNECTICUT 

4246
02:37:38,482 --> 02:37:40,751
AVENUE THERE WERE TVS OUT, I 

4247
02:37:40,751 --> 02:37:44,021
REMEMBER I WAS WITH SARAH 

4248
02:37:44,021 --> 02:37:45,322
TAYLOR WHO WORKED AT THE WHITE 

4249
02:37:45,322 --> 02:37:45,588
HOUSE. 

4250
02:37:45,588 --> 02:37:47,124
AND WE WATCHED -- WE WERE 

4251
02:37:47,124 --> 02:37:51,361
WATCHING WHEN THE TWO BUILDINGS 

4252
02:37:51,361 --> 02:37:51,561
FELL. 

4253
02:37:51,561 --> 02:37:55,332
>> WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS POST-9/11,

4254
02:37:55,332 --> 02:37:59,670
THAT WE HAVE BEEN AT WAR AND IT 

4255
02:37:59,670 --> 02:38:00,771
IS CALLED THE WAR ON TERRORISM, 

4256
02:38:00,771 --> 02:38:02,539
DO YOU GENERALLY AGREE WITH 

4257
02:38:02,539 --> 02:38:02,872
THAT CONCEPT? 

4258
02:38:02,872 --> 02:38:12,249
>> I DO, SENATOR. 

4259
02:38:12,249 --> 02:38:15,385
THAT WAS PASSED ON SEPTEMBER 14.

4260
02:38:15,385 --> 02:38:17,120
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE LAW AND 

4261
02:38:17,120 --> 02:38:17,320
WAR. 

4262
02:38:17,320 --> 02:38:20,824
IS THERE A BODY OF LAW CALLED 

4263
02:38:20,824 --> 02:38:23,060
THE LAW OF ARMS CONFLICT? 

4264
02:38:23,060 --> 02:38:24,060
>> THERE IS. 

4265
02:38:24,060 --> 02:38:26,730
THE IS THERE ONE CALLED BASIC 

4266
02:38:26,730 --> 02:38:27,564
CRIMINAL LAW? 

4267
02:38:27,564 --> 02:38:32,302
>> YES. 

4268
02:38:32,302 --> 02:38:33,036
>> ARE THERE DIFFERENCES? 

4269
02:38:33,036 --> 02:38:33,804
>> YES, SENATOR. 

4270
02:38:33,804 --> 02:38:35,005
>> FROM A CITIZEN'S POINT OF 

4271
02:38:35,005 --> 02:38:36,306
VIEW DO YOUR RIGHTS FOLLOW YOU? 

4272
02:38:36,306 --> 02:38:38,208
IF YOU'RE IN PARIS, DOES THE 

4273
02:38:38,208 --> 02:38:40,477
FOURTH AMENDMENT DETECT YOU AS 

4274
02:38:40,477 --> 02:38:41,711
AN AMERICAN FROM YOUR OWN 

4275
02:38:41,711 --> 02:38:42,813
GOVERNMENT? 

4276
02:38:42,813 --> 02:38:44,681
>> FROM YOUR OWN GOVERNMENT, 

4277
02:38:44,681 --> 02:38:44,914
YES. 

4278
02:38:44,914 --> 02:38:47,317
>> OKAY. 

4279
02:38:47,317 --> 02:38:48,818
IF YOU ARE IN AFGHANISTAN, DO 

4280
02:38:48,818 --> 02:38:51,188
YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS 

4281
02:38:51,188 --> 02:38:53,890
PROTECT YOU AGAINST YOUR OWN 

4282
02:38:53,890 --> 02:38:55,325
GOVERNMENT? 

4283
02:38:55,325 --> 02:38:57,694
>> IF YOU'RE AN AMERICAN IN 

4284
02:38:57,694 --> 02:38:59,196
AFGHANISTAN, YOU HAVE 

4285
02:38:59,196 --> 02:38:59,796
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AS 

4286
02:38:59,796 --> 02:39:03,867
AGAINSTTHE U.S. GOVERNMENT. 

4287
02:39:03,867 --> 02:39:04,334
THAT'S LONG SETTLED. 

4288
02:39:04,334 --> 02:39:05,702
>> ISN'T THERE ALSO A LONG 

4289
02:39:05,702 --> 02:39:07,671
SETTLED LAW THAT GOES BACK TO A 

4290
02:39:07,671 --> 02:39:13,377
CASE, I CAN'T MEMBER THE NAME. 

4291
02:39:13,377 --> 02:39:14,111
AMERICAN CITIZENS WHO 

4292
02:39:14,111 --> 02:39:15,779
COLLABORATE WITH THE ENEMY ARE 

4293
02:39:15,779 --> 02:39:18,215
CONSIDERED ENEMY OF COMBATANTS? 

4294
02:39:18,215 --> 02:39:19,482
>> THEY CAN BE. 

4295
02:39:19,482 --> 02:39:21,418
>> CAN BE? 

4296
02:39:21,418 --> 02:39:24,855
>> THEY ARE SOMETIMES CRIMINALLY

4297
02:39:24,855 --> 02:39:25,689
PROSECUTED AND SOMETIMES 

4298
02:39:25,689 --> 02:39:26,523
TREATED IN THE -- 

4299
02:39:26,523 --> 02:39:30,594
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT CAN BE. 

4300
02:39:30,594 --> 02:39:33,730
THERE IS A DECISION THAT SAID 

4301
02:39:33,730 --> 02:39:35,332
AMERICAN CITIZENS WHO 

4302
02:39:35,332 --> 02:39:38,802
COLLABORATED WITH SABOTEURS 

4303
02:39:38,802 --> 02:39:40,203
WERE TRIED BY THE MILITARY, IS 

4304
02:39:40,203 --> 02:39:40,570
THAT CORRECT? 

4305
02:39:40,570 --> 02:39:41,605
>> THAT IS CORRECT. 

4306
02:39:41,605 --> 02:39:42,839
>> I THINK A COUPLE WERE 

4307
02:39:42,839 --> 02:39:43,240
EXECUTED? 

4308
02:39:43,240 --> 02:39:43,640
>> YES. 

4309
02:39:43,640 --> 02:39:45,308
>> SO IF ANYBODY DOUBTS THERE 

4310
02:39:45,308 --> 02:39:47,878
IS A LONG-STANDING HISTORY IN 

4311
02:39:47,878 --> 02:39:50,113
THIS COUNTRY, THAT YOUR 

4312
02:39:50,113 --> 02:39:51,982
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS FOLLOW 

4313
02:39:51,982 --> 02:39:53,417
YOU WHEREVER YOU GO BUT YOU 

4314
02:39:53,417 --> 02:39:54,217
DON'T HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL 

4315
02:39:54,217 --> 02:39:55,618
RIGHT TO TURN ON YOUR OWN 

4316
02:39:55,618 --> 02:39:57,387
GOVERNMENT, ELABORATE WITH THE 

4317
02:39:57,387 --> 02:39:58,488
ENEMY OF THE NATION. 

4318
02:39:58,488 --> 02:40:01,458
YOU'LL BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY. 

4319
02:40:01,458 --> 02:40:02,993
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE CASE, 

4320
02:40:02,993 --> 02:40:05,062
IF YOU CAN RECALL, THAT 

4321
02:40:05,062 --> 02:40:06,596
REAFFIRMED THE CONCEPT THAT YOU 

4322
02:40:06,596 --> 02:40:09,366
COULD HOLD ONE OF OUR OWN AS AN 

4323
02:40:09,366 --> 02:40:10,701
ENEMY COMBATANT IF THEY WERE 

4324
02:40:10,701 --> 02:40:13,070
ENGAGED IN TERRORIST 

4325
02:40:13,070 --> 02:40:13,403
ACTIVITIES? 

4326
02:40:13,403 --> 02:40:15,739
>> YES. 

4327
02:40:15,739 --> 02:40:17,573
>> SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS ON 

4328
02:40:17,573 --> 02:40:20,610
EVERY CITIZEN ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE 

4329
02:40:20,610 --> 02:40:21,945
RIGHTS, WE DO NOT HAVE A 

4330
02:40:21,945 --> 02:40:22,846
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT THAT CAN 

4331
02:40:22,846 --> 02:40:24,681
ELABORATE WITH THE ENEMY. 

4332
02:40:24,681 --> 02:40:26,116
THERE IS A BODY OF LAW WELL 

4333
02:40:26,116 --> 02:40:28,251
DEVELOPED LONG BEFORE 9/11 THAT 

4334
02:40:28,251 --> 02:40:29,319
UNDERSTOOD THE DIFFERENCE 

4335
02:40:29,319 --> 02:40:31,288
BETWEEN BASIC CRIMINAL LAW AND 

4336
02:40:31,288 --> 02:40:35,325
THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT. 

4337
02:40:35,325 --> 02:40:36,093
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THOSE 

4338
02:40:36,093 --> 02:40:36,960
DIFFERENCES? 

4339
02:40:36,960 --> 02:40:39,763
>> I DO. 

4340
02:40:39,763 --> 02:40:41,064
I DO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE 

4341
02:40:41,064 --> 02:40:41,898
DIFFERENT BODIES OF LAW. 

4342
02:40:41,898 --> 02:40:42,499
OF COURSE, SENATOR. 

4343
02:40:42,499 --> 02:40:44,434
>> IF YOU ARE CONFIRMED, AND I 

4344
02:40:44,434 --> 02:40:48,405
BELIEVE YOU WILL BE, WHAT IS 

4345
02:40:48,405 --> 02:40:51,208
YOUR HOPE WHEN ALL OF THIS IS 

4346
02:40:51,208 --> 02:40:53,943
SAID AND DONE AND YOUR TIME IS 

4347
02:40:53,943 --> 02:40:57,948
UP, HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE 

4348
02:40:57,948 --> 02:40:59,316
REMEMBERED? 

4349
02:40:59,316 --> 02:41:08,659
>> A GOOD DAD. 

4350
02:41:08,659 --> 02:41:11,361
A GOOD JUDGE. 

4351
02:41:11,361 --> 02:41:14,297
>> GOOD HUSBAND. 

4352
02:41:14,297 --> 02:41:15,899
>> I THINK HE IS GETTING THERE. 

4353
02:41:15,899 --> 02:41:17,367
>> GOOD HUSBAND. 

4354
02:41:17,367 --> 02:41:21,972
[ LAUGHTER ] THANKS, DIANE. 

4355
02:41:21,972 --> 02:41:24,608
YOU HELPED HIM A LOT. 

4356
02:41:24,608 --> 02:41:26,243
IT'S GOING TO BE BETTER FOR YOU 

4357
02:41:26,243 --> 02:41:26,510
TONIGHT. 

4358
02:41:26,510 --> 02:41:27,410
[ LAUGHTER ] 

4359
02:41:27,410 --> 02:41:30,647
>> IOU. 

4360
02:41:30,647 --> 02:41:34,117
AGAIN SON. 

4361
02:41:34,117 --> 02:41:37,387
-- A GOOD SON. 

4362
02:41:37,387 --> 02:41:39,856
I WILL QUICKLY ADD THAT. 

4363
02:41:39,856 --> 02:41:41,091
THE PILLARS OF MY LIFE FOR 

4364
02:41:41,091 --> 02:41:42,859
BEING A JUDGE, OF COURSE. 

4365
02:41:42,859 --> 02:41:43,326
BEING A TEACHER. 

4366
02:41:43,326 --> 02:41:46,263
I HAVE DONE THAT. 

4367
02:41:46,263 --> 02:41:47,330
EITHER WAY, I'M GOING TO 

4368
02:41:47,330 --> 02:41:48,097
CONTINUE TEACHING. 

4369
02:41:48,097 --> 02:41:50,834
COACHING. AS I MENTIONED, 

4370
02:41:50,834 --> 02:41:52,836
THAT'S A HUGE PART OF MY LIFE. 

4371
02:41:52,836 --> 02:41:55,705
SENATOR KENNEDY ADVISED ME WHEN 

4372
02:41:55,705 --> 02:41:57,507
WE MET, MAKE SURE YOU KEEP 

4373
02:41:57,507 --> 02:41:59,075
COACHING. I'M GOING TO FOLLOW 

4374
02:41:59,075 --> 02:41:59,308
THAT. 

4375
02:41:59,308 --> 02:42:01,178
VOLUNTEERING. 

4376
02:42:01,178 --> 02:42:05,815
AND BEING A DAD AND A SON AND A 

4377
02:42:05,815 --> 02:42:10,353
HUSBAND AND BEING A FRIEND. 

4378
02:42:10,353 --> 02:42:11,621
I TALKED ABOUT MY FRIENDS 

4379
02:42:11,621 --> 02:42:11,921
YESTERDAY. 

4380
02:42:11,921 --> 02:42:13,190
I DIDN'T REALLY EXPECT -- I GOT 

4381
02:42:13,190 --> 02:42:14,824
A LITTLE BIT CHOKED UP. 

4382
02:42:14,824 --> 02:42:16,827
>> THAT WAS WELL SAID. 

4383
02:42:16,827 --> 02:42:19,095
I JUST RAN OUT OF TIME. 

4384
02:42:19,095 --> 02:42:20,296
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR. 

4385
02:42:20,296 --> 02:42:23,333
I WILL STOP THERE. 

4386
02:42:23,333 --> 02:42:25,335
WE WE ARE ABOUT READY TO BREAK 

4387
02:42:25,335 --> 02:42:27,471
FOR LUNCH AND A VOTE THAT WE 

4388
02:42:27,471 --> 02:42:27,671
HAVE. 

4389
02:42:27,671 --> 02:42:29,206
IT WILL BE 30 MINUTES. 

4390
02:42:29,206 --> 02:42:31,107
FOR I DO THAT, I HAVE A LETTER 

4391
02:42:31,107 --> 02:42:35,312
THAT SENATOR FEINSTEIN ASKED ME 

4392
02:42:35,312 --> 02:42:39,382
TO PUT IN THE RECORD  -- 70 

4393
02:42:39,382 --> 02:42:40,383
LETTERS FROM PEOPLE IN 

4394
02:42:40,383 --> 02:42:42,085
OPPOSITION TO YOUR NOMINATION. 

4395
02:42:42,085 --> 02:42:45,889
AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE LETTERS 

4396
02:42:45,889 --> 02:42:50,961
IN SUPPORT OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH  

4397
02:42:50,961 --> 02:42:52,295
FROM HUNDREDS OF MEN AND WOMEN 

4398
02:42:52,295 --> 02:42:53,430
ACROSS THE COUNTRY HOLDING 

4399
02:42:53,430 --> 02:42:56,666
DIVERSE POLITICAL VIEWS. 

4400
02:42:56,666 --> 02:42:57,467
THEY STRONGLY SUPPORT HIS 

4401
02:42:57,467 --> 02:42:58,235
CONFIRMATION. 

4402
02:42:58,235 --> 02:43:02,305
THOSE WILL BE ENTERED INTO THE 

4403
02:43:02,305 --> 02:43:02,706
RECORD ALSO. 

4404
02:43:02,706 --> 02:43:03,740
AND THEN I WANTED TO EXPLAIN 

4405
02:43:03,740 --> 02:43:06,109
THE EXCHANGE THAT I HAD WITH 

4406
02:43:06,109 --> 02:43:07,611
SENATOR LEAHY.  

4407
02:43:07,611 --> 02:43:08,912
JUST SO PEOPLE DON'T THINK THAT 

4408
02:43:08,912 --> 02:43:11,214
IS SOMETHING THAT I DID ON MY 

4409
02:43:11,214 --> 02:43:12,983
OWN. 

4410
02:43:12,983 --> 02:43:15,318
WE HAD PREVIOUSLY SENT OUT A 

4411
02:43:15,318 --> 02:43:18,154
LETTER AND ONLY SENATOR 

4412
02:43:18,154 --> 02:43:20,624
KLOBUCHAR UP TO THAT  POINT HAD 

4413
02:43:20,624 --> 02:43:21,424
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE LETTER 

4414
02:43:21,424 --> 02:43:26,329
TO BE ABLE TO ASK FOR DOCUMENTS 

4415
02:43:26,329 --> 02:43:28,965
THAT WERE COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL

4416
02:43:28,965 --> 02:43:30,367
. SO THAT THEY COULD USE THEM 

4417
02:43:30,367 --> 02:43:31,367
AT THE HEARING. 

4418
02:43:31,367 --> 02:43:34,204
AND THE ONLY THING I'VE DONE 

4419
02:43:34,204 --> 02:43:35,705
FOR SENATOR LEAHY  THAT WASN'T 

4420
02:43:35,705 --> 02:43:38,008
ALREADY IN THAT LETTER WAS TO 

4421
02:43:38,008 --> 02:43:39,876
REMIND PEOPLE THAT WE DID THE 

4422
02:43:39,876 --> 02:43:43,046
SAME THING FOR THE NEIL GORSUCH 

4423
02:43:43,046 --> 02:43:44,848
NOMINATION TO THE SUPREME COURT.

4424
02:43:44,848 --> 02:43:48,118
IT IS POLICY THAT SENATOR LEAHY 

4425
02:43:48,118 --> 02:43:50,654
WHEN HE WAS CHAIRMAN  FOLLOWED. 

4426
02:43:50,654 --> 02:43:56,159
SO THE ONLY COURTESY WAS 

4427
02:43:56,159 --> 02:43:56,993
EXTENDED TO SENATOR LEAHY, THE 

4428
02:43:56,993 --> 02:43:58,395
FACT THAT HE DIDN'T MAKE THE 

4429
02:43:58,395 --> 02:43:59,629
REQUEST  BY THE TIMELINE THAT 

4430
02:43:59,629 --> 02:44:04,000
WAS IN THE LEATHER -- LETTER. 

4431
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:05,202
WE ARE GOING TO ADJOURN 30 

4432
02:44:05,202 --> 02:44:06,136
MINUTES FOR A LUNCH BREAK. 

4433
02:44:06,136 --> 02:44:08,538
AND I THINK WE'LL BE BACK 

4434
02:44:08,538 --> 02:44:09,673
EXACTLY IN 30 MINUTES. 

4435
02:44:09,673 --> 02:44:14,611
IF NOT, JUDGE KAVANAUGH  WE 

4436
02:44:14,611 --> 02:44:15,946
WILL BE LET YOUR STAFF KNOW IF 

4437
02:44:15,946 --> 02:44:16,746
IT WILL BE LATER. 

4438
02:44:16,746 --> 02:44:18,081
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO 

4439
02:44:18,081 --> 02:44:19,316
HAPPEN IN THE SENATE WHEN YOU 

4440
02:44:19,316 --> 02:44:20,317
HAVE A VOTE. 

4441
02:44:26,856 --> 02:44:28,491
>>> THERE YOU HAVE IT. 

4442
02:44:28,491 --> 02:44:29,993
DAY TWO OF THE BRETT KAVANAUGH 

4443
02:44:29,993 --> 02:44:30,860
CONFIRMATION  HEARINGS. 

4444
02:44:30,860 --> 02:44:33,763
ANOTHER EXHAUSTIVE MORNING IN 

4445
02:44:33,763 --> 02:44:34,564
WHICH LAWMAKERS WERE GIVEN A 

4446
02:44:34,564 --> 02:44:36,399
HALF HOUR EACH TO QUESTION THE 

4447
02:44:36,399 --> 02:44:39,836
JUDGE AND ALL OF THEM TOOK FULL 

4448
02:44:39,836 --> 02:44:43,073
ADVANTAGE OF THAT HALF HOUR. 

4449
02:44:43,073 --> 02:44:44,274
HE WAS REALLY QUESTIONED ON A 

4450
02:44:44,274 --> 02:44:45,075
VARIETY OF THINGS, OF COURSE. 

4451
02:44:45,075 --> 02:44:47,310
ROE V. WADE  WAS A LENGTHY BACK-

4452
02:44:47,310 --> 02:44:48,945
AND-FORTH. 

4453
02:44:48,945 --> 02:44:50,013
SOME STOLEN EMAILS THAT 

4454
02:44:50,013 --> 02:44:52,916
APPARENTLY THE JUDGE HAD 

4455
02:44:52,916 --> 02:44:54,384
RECEIVED THAT CAME FROM LEAHY'S 

4456
02:44:54,384 --> 02:44:56,653
OFFICE. 

4457
02:44:56,653 --> 02:44:58,088
AND HE WAS QUESTIONED A FEW 

4458
02:44:58,088 --> 02:44:59,756
TIMES ABOUT THIS IDEA IF A 

4459
02:44:59,756 --> 02:45:00,657
SITTING PRESIDENT SHOULD BE 

4460
02:45:00,657 --> 02:45:04,027
ABLE TO BE INDICTED. 

4461
02:45:04,027 --> 02:45:05,261
YOU KNOW, HE WORKED WITH KEN 

4462
02:45:05,261 --> 02:45:08,698
STAR DURING THE IMPEACHMENT OF 

4463
02:45:08,698 --> 02:45:08,965
CLINTON. 

4464
02:45:08,965 --> 02:45:17,240
AND HE WAS ASKED -- INVOLVED 

4465
02:45:17,240 --> 02:45:19,209
DEEPLY IN THAT. 

4466
02:45:19,209 --> 02:45:20,843
AND HE WAS ASKED WHEN HIS 

4467
02:45:20,843 --> 02:45:22,679
OPINION ON HOW A PRESIDENT 

4468
02:45:22,679 --> 02:45:24,748
SHOULD BE TREATED AND IF HE 

4469
02:45:24,748 --> 02:45:26,883
SHOULD BE INDICTED, HE SAID IT 

4470
02:45:26,883 --> 02:45:31,221
WAS AFTER 9/11. 

4471
02:45:31,221 --> 02:45:34,357
HE SAID HOW FOCUSED PRESIDENT 

4472
02:45:34,357 --> 02:45:38,595
BUSH WAS AFTER HE ATTACKED THIS 

4473
02:45:38,595 --> 02:45:41,331
ISSUE AND THE WAR ON TERRORISM. 

4474
02:45:41,331 --> 02:45:44,901
HE THOUGHT, IT IS SUCH A WEIGHTY

4475
02:45:44,901 --> 02:45:49,272
JOB THAT YOU ADD AN 

4476
02:45:49,272 --> 02:45:53,843
INVESTIGATION WILL BE TOO MUCH. 

4477
02:45:53,843 --> 02:45:55,378
WE ALSO SAW HIM LOOKING LIKE HE 

4478
02:45:55,378 --> 02:45:56,279
WAS GOING TO TEAR UP. 

4479
02:45:56,279 --> 02:45:56,579
>> YES. 

4480
02:45:56,579 --> 02:45:57,414
>> LINDSEY GRAHAM STARTED 

4481
02:45:57,414 --> 02:45:59,950
TALKING ABOUT HIS DAUGHTERS. 

4482
02:45:59,950 --> 02:46:00,850
>>'S LEGACY, HIS DAUGHTERS. 

4483
02:46:00,850 --> 02:46:02,852
HE ALSO WAS ASKED A POINTED 

4484
02:46:02,852 --> 02:46:05,221
QUESTION ABOUT ROE V. WADE. 

4485
02:46:05,221 --> 02:46:08,358
HE SAID  LEGALIZED ABORTION IS 

4486
02:46:08,358 --> 02:46:10,327
AN IMPORTANT PRESIDENT OF THE 

4487
02:46:10,327 --> 02:46:12,128
SUPREME COURT THAT HAS BEEN 

4488
02:46:12,128 --> 02:46:14,764
REAFFIRMED MANY TIMES. 

4489
02:46:14,764 --> 02:46:16,132
TAKE A LISTEN. 

4490
02:46:16,132 --> 02:46:17,766
>> AS A JUDGE, IT IS AN 

4491
02:46:17,766 --> 02:46:20,503
IMPORTANT PRECEDENT OF THE 

4492
02:46:20,503 --> 02:46:20,970
SUPREME COURT. 

4493
02:46:20,970 --> 02:46:24,107
BY IT, I MEAN ROE V. WADE  AND 

4494
02:46:24,107 --> 02:46:25,942
PLANNED PARENTHOOD AGAINST 

4495
02:46:25,942 --> 02:46:26,476
CASEY.  

4496
02:46:26,476 --> 02:46:30,013
CASEY IS  PRECEDENT ON 

4497
02:46:30,013 --> 02:46:30,513
PRECEDENT. 

4498
02:46:30,513 --> 02:46:33,783
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT FACTOR TO 

4499
02:46:33,783 --> 02:46:34,818
REMEMBER. 

4500
02:46:34,818 --> 02:46:36,386
AND I UNDERSTAND THE 

4501
02:46:36,386 --> 02:46:39,689
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ISSUE. 

4502
02:46:39,689 --> 02:46:41,057
AND I UNDERSTAND THE 

4503
02:46:41,057 --> 02:46:44,560
SIGNIFICANCE OF -- AS BEST I 

4504
02:46:44,560 --> 02:46:45,728
CAN. 

4505
02:46:45,728 --> 02:46:47,330
I ALWAYS TRY. 

4506
02:46:47,330 --> 02:46:48,865
I DO HERE EFFECTS OF THAT 

4507
02:46:48,865 --> 02:46:50,467
DECISION AS I TRY TO DO WITH 

4508
02:46:50,467 --> 02:46:52,702
ALL THE DECISIONS OF MY COURT 

4509
02:46:52,702 --> 02:46:54,904
AND OF THE SUPREME COURT. 

4510
02:46:54,904 --> 02:46:55,905
>> SO NOW WHAT IS INTERESTING 

4511
02:46:55,905 --> 02:46:57,140
ABOUT THE RESPONSE, AND WE 

4512
02:46:57,140 --> 02:47:01,077
HAVEN'T HEARD YET FROM SENATOR 

4513
02:47:01,077 --> 02:47:03,413
SHELDON WHO IS MANY CONSIDERED 

4514
02:47:03,413 --> 02:47:06,015
OF HAVING A GREAT LEGAL MIND, I 

4515
02:47:06,015 --> 02:47:08,117
SUSPECT THAT OTHERS WHO ARE 

4516
02:47:08,117 --> 02:47:09,652
INTERESTED IN GETTING HIS 

4517
02:47:09,652 --> 02:47:14,824
POSITION ON ROE V. WADE ARE 

4518
02:47:14,824 --> 02:47:15,658
GOING TO ASK HIM. 

4519
02:47:15,658 --> 02:47:17,360
AND SO YOU SAY, AND THIS IS A 

4520
02:47:17,360 --> 02:47:18,495
QUOTE,  IT IS AN IMPORTANT 

4521
02:47:18,495 --> 02:47:19,295
PRECEDENT THAT HAS BEEN 

4522
02:47:19,295 --> 02:47:19,896
REFORMED MANY TIMES. 

4523
02:47:19,896 --> 02:47:22,298
DO YOU THINK IT WAS DECIDED 

4524
02:47:22,298 --> 02:47:22,598
CORRECTLY? 

4525
02:47:22,598 --> 02:47:24,801
>> RIGHT. 

4526
02:47:24,801 --> 02:47:26,469
NOBODY IS PHRASED IT LIKE THAT 

4527
02:47:26,469 --> 02:47:28,004
YET. 

4528
02:47:28,004 --> 02:47:29,739
THE JUDGE HAS SHIED AWAY FROM 

4529
02:47:29,739 --> 02:47:31,073
ANY QUESTIONS THAT HE FEELS ARE 

4530
02:47:31,073 --> 02:47:32,742
HYPOTHETICAL SITUATIONS. 

4531
02:47:32,742 --> 02:47:36,846
AND THAT'S SORT OF HIS ANSWER. 

4532
02:47:36,846 --> 02:47:37,380
THIS IS HYPOTHETICAL. 

4533
02:47:37,380 --> 02:47:38,815
I'M NOT GOING TO GO ON THE 

4534
02:47:38,815 --> 02:47:39,048
RECORD. 

4535
02:47:39,048 --> 02:47:43,219
>> IT'S THE GINSBERG ROLE. 

4536
02:47:43,219 --> 02:47:47,724
