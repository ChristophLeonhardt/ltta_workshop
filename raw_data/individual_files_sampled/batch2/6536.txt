Brett Cavanaugh's opening statement during the hearing was a mix of anger and sadness and it began with anger which quite honestly I personally did not expect given the reactions from the Republicans in the Senate following Blasi Ford's testimony many of them said that it was credible it was an emotional testimony and so to respond to that with anger I believed would be a bad political calculation miscalculation and Cavanaugh decided to begin with anger and then proceeded to go in and out of anger and there was a lot of sadness intertwined so I want to show you some portions of that testimony starting with who Cavanaugh wants to blame all of this on take a look this whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit fueled with a parent pent up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups this is a circus the consequences will extend long past my nomination the consequences will be with us for decades so yeah tons of anger right out of the gate it was surprising but people like Judge Napolitano on Fox News who to be fair has been really honest with his opinion no matter which way that it it went including saying that she dr. Blasi for 100% credible then completed this thought by saying the only way that the Republicans rescue this is if Cavanaugh puts aside his veneer of I'm a judge who's above it and I will repeat lis legal talking points and comes out on fire and he did yes he came out on fire so now part of it I thought was very effective we're gonna show you a little bit more and then discuss it the but the parts you just saw might have been the least effective parts because when he says outside groups have spent millions of dollars on these allegations no wait a minute we just saw in the morning dr. Blasio Ford showed that there's no groups giving her any money or assistance and anything the prosecutor asked and asked about that and came up with nothing so in reality we we've told you that judicial crisis network a right-wing group is spending five million dollars supporting Cavanaugh and running ads all across the country some of which they had to pull back because one of his supporters said look I don't know that he didn't do it and and and and retracted her statements on it so and then saying this payback against Trump I mean look you can say it's deeply political from the Democrats but bringing Trump into it seems like now you're doing political strategy to try to get Trump riled up which worked and to get him to be solidly on your side but not his best case really quick one of the things that was emphasized throughout this hearing was the fact that Blasi Ford came forward with these allegations before Cavanaugh was selected as a Supreme Court nominee so he was on the list remember Trump has the list of the conservative approved Supreme Court potential Supreme Court nominees and it wasn't until Blasi Ford saw that he was on the list that she decided to take action right so it's important for those who think that this is just one hundred percent politically motivated because why didn't she bring up those allegations against all those other potential nominees if they're false allegations and this is only done for political knows living let me add to that because she was very clear she actually tried to get this in front of the Republicans as well in getting it sending it to the papers so they would pick a different Republican so that and and presumably that Republican would have an easier chance of getting confirmed because it isn't about politics she's just like don't pick this guy because of what he did to me I know he's a bad guy so that makes her super credible okay two words Mitch McConnell what did he know because he was lobbying hard to convince Trump to not choose Kavanagh yeah why yep so now nonetheless look there's three things that I think he did right in this testimony but let's keep watching and then I'll tell you and I don't even necessarily think it was strategy I III thought it was at least to some degree real so anyway let's go to the next part of the testimony why aren't you also asking the FBI to investigate these claims senator I'll do whatever the committee wants I wanted a hearing the day after the allegation came up I wanted to be here that day instead ten days passed where all this nonsense is coming out you know down I'm in gangs I'm on boats in Rhode Island I'm in Colorado you know I'm cited all over the place and these things are printed and run breathlessly by cable news you know I wanted a hearing the next day my family's been destroyed by this senator so he said repeatedly throughout both his opening statement and in the questioning as you see there that his family has been destroyed by this and in in a lot of ways his name I don't know about his family but his name has been destroyed by it either justly so or unjustly so so now the three parts that I thought were effective were when he talked about his daughter and and he got really emotional around his family every time he talked about it and it was awkward and he was sniffing because he was you know on the verge of breaking down slash breaking down not just he started with anger but then he he went to tears and sadness but it was it was genuine emotion and that party was not for in my opinion was not remotely faking I will see what you think but you know when he talked about his daughter point one when he said my ten-year-old said let's not forget to pray for dr. Ford too and you know if it was a trick it was a great trick because that worked really really well and he got all choked up and it was it was powerful to me point to maybe I'm a sucker for this but when he talked about his dad and he got all emotional about that and his mom that works on me it probably works on a lot of people I don't know if I'm a sucker for but it certainly seemed genuine and then where we might have our biggest disagreement what he talked about the thing that he regretted the most was what happened to Renata so this is that's a girl that was in a nearby school they did 14 of the people in the yearbook including Cavanaugh said that they were Renata alumni that seems like they hooked up with her and bragged about it now he's still lied in that testimony in the opening when he said oh it was not of a sexual nature we were just talking about how we were all good friends with her not remotely true okay of course it was about hooking up but I was pleasantly surprised to see that he really seemed to really really regret that like that's where he got almost the most emotional like we he's like I called my friends and said why did we do that that we shouldn't you know basically we shouldn't have done that and that was one of the stories that bothered me the most that it and the fact that he went out of his way to show contrition on that I thought was was was a point on his side no in my mind no question about it boy do you think yeah we have significant disagreement so I think that he let first let's let me mention what we do agree on the emotion did seem genuine I agree with you on that I do believe that everything he said with the exception of the clear lies was politically motivated well politically savvy and I think that it's naive to think that his statements weren't specifically politically motivated now with that said I am so sick and tired of this goody two-shoes nonsense coming from Cavanaugh okay especially when it comes to the Renata thing really so his his excuse for being a Renata alumni in his personal yearbook page was no this was just a friend of mine you know it was just to show admiration for her someone that we dated or you know it was nothing about bragging about sexual conquests yeah no that is a lie it's a lie stop with the nonsense regarding how you're this I believe in God and I you know my daughter asked to pray for the victim here come on I I'm sick of it I'm sick of it okay let's let's stick to the facts but instead you know he's lying about the Renata thing he lied about his willingness to do an FBI investigation during his opening statement okay he lied about corroborating evidence in regard to Ford's accusations there were lies in there and he's under oath and so that is more relevant to me than the tears and the non-stop water drinking and the emotion I want to get to the heart of the truth and if he's as innocent as he claims let's do the investigation but he's unwilling to do that so let me be clear on the Renata issue I agree with you Anna that it's maddening that to this day and clearly perjuring himself there he's pretending that it wasn't about hooking up no 14 guys on the football team write about how they were the alumni of a particular girl because golly gee they liked her so much as a friend you went to high school you know that everybody knows that so he lost me when he said that but on the other hand he did seem genuinely broken up that they had screwed up and and said that about her and it is possible that their friends and bragged about hooking up with her and he genuinely is remorseful about that it's also possible that that is evidence that works against him and he's remorseful for that purpose as well because remember asked we're not I had no idea about it she didn't know until the story recently broke indicating that they had referenced her the football team including Brett Kavanaugh had referenced her in that way in their in the yearbook pages and then she had to pull support and she was embarrassed by it right of course deeply embarrassed that I'm just glad he was at least remorseful about it because it was such a terrible thing to do let alone all the other allegations alright look but the thing that I'm the strongest on in terms of the is that people seem to think that him being angry and then emotional is clear evidence one way or another and we're running out of time here so I'm going to save the stories about how I've been in the angry in the past over-the-top angry when I was right and when I was wrong I've done both so I'll tell you those stories in the postgame and this is why part of the reason we have memberships so we can do more content for you guys so T y-t-dot-com slides joined to become a member if you don't know and we'll talk about those but I know in my personal experience that sometimes when you're wrong you get your dander up you're like oh yeah and you go over the top so it could have been that no question and I know sometimes if I've been wrongly accused of whatever right I'm super pissed and I do like to me the idea that getting angry means that you did it makes no logical sense at all so to me that anger is not dispositive in either direction like what you see click this subscribe button below and don't forget to ring the bell to never miss another video from the Young Turks
