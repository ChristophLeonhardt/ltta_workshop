1
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,090
Desmond asked me to marry him.

2
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,320
And he’s still incarcerated.

3
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,060
It’s been a year.

4
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,750
Still no sentence. No verdict.

5
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,160
I hate your hurt.

6
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,180
I hate those lies I told you.

7
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,770
I want to marry
you and only you.

8
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,000
I want to look back from the
end of our long life marriage

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,170
and say, “Look
where we come from.

10
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,800
Look at what got us here.”

11
00:01:12,242 --> 00:01:14,310
I love you so much, baby.

12
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,726
So much.

13
00:01:16,726 --> 00:01:20,900
Will you honestly,
honestly marry me?

14
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,610
Baby, I want this
with you forever.

15
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,220
Forever lifetime
with you. Only you.

16
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,336
What would it look like to
marry Desmond in prison?

17
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,820
Feeling that you’re alone.

18
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,236
Knowing that you’re alone.

19
00:01:46,912 --> 00:01:48,880
That’s the scary part.

20
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,260
During courthouse
hearings, the sheriff

21
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,400
brings the inmates around back.

22
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,294
It’s hours of them sitting
in a hot bus with only breaks

23
00:02:09,294 --> 00:02:11,570
to use the bathroom.

24
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:15,710
But I’m always there to
see him, just to wave.

25
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,132
Well, it’s a big day today.

26
00:02:37,132 --> 00:02:38,550
Yeah.

27
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,440
I know you’ve been
coming here a lot.

28
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,690
And I thought maybe — let’s
just take a quick minute

29
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,360
before we go in.

30
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,840
Just talk about what’s
going to happen today.

31
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,130
Today’s a ruling day.

32
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,980
The last couple
times we’ve been in

33
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,184
has been testimony on whether
the evidence that the sheriff’s

34
00:02:54,184 --> 00:02:57,293
department found on
your fiancee as well

35
00:02:57,293 --> 00:02:59,376
as many of his co-defendants
should be admissible.

36
00:02:59,376 --> 00:02:59,876
Right.

37
00:02:59,876 --> 00:03:01,580
So hopefully today
is a good day.

38
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,498
And she determines
that that evidence was

39
00:03:04,498 --> 00:03:06,370
obtained unconstitutionally.

40
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,816
Whether we get a
good or bad ruling,

41
00:03:08,816 --> 00:03:10,315
this thing isn’t
going to end today.

42
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:10,690
Yeah.

43
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,965
Unfortunately, we’re going
to have to set another date.

44
00:03:12,965 --> 00:03:13,464
O.K.

45
00:03:13,464 --> 00:03:15,850
And probably a trial
date, and probably

46
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:19,081
a pretrial date, which allows
us to continue negotiations

47
00:03:19,081 --> 00:03:22,080
with the assistant district
attorney in their office.

48
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,894
O.K.

49
00:03:22,894 --> 00:03:24,920
Hopefully get a good — 
an amicable resolution —

50
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,419
Yes.

51
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:26,467
— to the case.

52
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:27,800
And hopefully a fast resolution.

53
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,730
Because I know this has
been going on for so long —

54
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:30,230
Yes.

55
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,850
— with your families.

56
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,059
So let’s walk on up together.

57
00:03:33,059 --> 00:03:35,266
And if you have any questions,
again, just, you know,

58
00:03:35,266 --> 00:03:35,970
let me know, O.K.?

59
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,470
O.K.

60
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,303
All right, let’s go.

61
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:43,554
Good morning.

62
00:03:43,604 --> 00:03:44,586
Good morning.

63
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,450
How do I see myself?

64
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,870
Attractive.

65
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,300
Beautiful.

66
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,240
Glamorous.

67
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,930
Having a happy glow off of me.

68
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:12,330
With a cathedral train.

69
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,352
Lots of lace.

70
00:04:14,352 --> 00:04:17,149
Detail.

71
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:20,021
Pearls, diamonds everywhere.

72
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:27,690
I want to be able to
say I feel happy.

73
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,238
I’m beautiful in this dress.

74
00:04:30,238 --> 00:04:32,410
I’m sexy in this dress.

75
00:04:39,624 --> 00:04:41,806
I want to be able to smile.

76
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:04,240
Well, I was coming here to tell
you Saturday me and Desmond

77
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,704
getting married.

78
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:06,204
[mother] What?

79
00:05:06,204 --> 00:05:08,644
[screaming] Girl, why you marrying
a nigger in jail?

80
00:05:08,644 --> 00:05:11,572
What is it about fucking
Desmond that you got to marry

81
00:05:11,572 --> 00:05:14,012
fucking Desmond in jail?

82
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:14,988
[grandmother] Kim, stop.

83
00:05:14,988 --> 00:05:16,452
Please stop the hollering.

84
00:05:16,452 --> 00:05:18,404
You can through it
better than your —

85
00:05:18,404 --> 00:05:20,860
[mother] Why, she just said she’s
marrying Desmond in jail.

86
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,370
[grandmother] What?

87
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,280
Tell me that again?

88
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,349
[mother] She just said she’s marrying
Desmond Saturday

89
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:29,311
in fucking jail.

90
00:05:29,311 --> 00:05:31,280
[grandmother] That’s true?

91
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,140
My heart is sad.

92
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,122
For what?

93
00:05:38,566 --> 00:05:40,042
Because I love him.

94
00:05:40,042 --> 00:05:42,010
[mother, screaming]
Because you love him?

95
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,978
[grandmother] Kimberly.

96
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:45,454
[mother, shouting] That’s all?

97
00:05:45,454 --> 00:05:48,406
If he was a real man,
he’ll tell you, Alone,

98
00:05:48,406 --> 00:05:50,374
I’mma see you when
I get out of here.

99
00:05:50,374 --> 00:05:52,342
Instead, you’re
trying to help him.

100
00:05:52,342 --> 00:05:55,294
You can’t even help your
children and yourself,

101
00:05:55,294 --> 00:05:57,262
trying to help fucking Desmond.

102
00:05:57,262 --> 00:05:59,880
Desmond’s got family.

103
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,080
Come on, Alone.

104
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,470
[grandmother]
You got so much going for you.

105
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,172
Why?

106
00:06:05,172 --> 00:06:06,600
You know, love is —

107
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,143
[mother] I don’t have nothing
against nobody incarcerated.

108
00:06:09,143 --> 00:06:12,510
Shit happens to people. Life.

109
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,986
I’ve dealt with that enough.

110
00:06:14,986 --> 00:06:18,150
I saw that enough.

111
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,580
[grandmother] That’s a bad decision.

112
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,284
What point is it?

113
00:06:23,284 --> 00:06:24,829
What is it going
to do for y’all?

114
00:06:24,829 --> 00:06:26,810
What is it going to do for you?

115
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:49,341
[on cellphone] 
When I was living the way I was living,

116
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:52,530
I didn’t even know me. Myself.

117
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,380
I hated myself.

118
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:00,900
I grew up with hatred
in me for a long time.

119
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,970
Long time.

120
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:06,010
My teachers treated me bad —

121
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,050
I was quiet.

122
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,280
I was smart.

123
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,758
A really good kid.

124
00:07:12,758 --> 00:07:15,726
Hurt me like that.

125
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:19,190
Then I became a bad child.

126
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:22,482
My life so fucked
then on out.

127
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,126
Every year.

128
00:07:25,126 --> 00:07:28,876
Every year since I
became a class clown.

129
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:30,704
Fighting.

130
00:07:30,704 --> 00:07:32,584
Lying.

131
00:07:32,584 --> 00:07:35,720
Doing what I wanted to do.

132
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,486
I don’t want to be without you.

133
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,710
Yes, thank you for calling
Cash Cow, where we say yes.

134
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,400
This is Aloné.

135
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,170
May I help you?

136
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,340
OK, we offer payday, which is
due back on your next payday.

137
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,620
We offer title only if you
have a clear free title

138
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,410
to your vehicle.

139
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,050
You can get a title loan on that.

140
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,690
If you’re looking for a
personal loan, we don’t do that.

141
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,286
That would be a finance company.

142
00:08:21,286 --> 00:08:23,000
You’re welcome, no problem.

143
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:38,799
Without my mother’s blessings
it was like God’s intervention.

144
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:43,030
Because on Saturday I was told
the warden denied our request

145
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,160
for a ceremony.

146
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,350
And I thought… now I
have time to think.

147
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:24,490
This system breaks you apart.

148
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:30,800
It is designed, just like
slavery, to tear you apart.

149
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,550
And instead of using the
whip, they use mother time.

150
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,830
They use hardships.

151
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,730
They may not hang
you from the tree.

152
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,250
But the experience
itself is just

153
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,590
like when they used to
hang people, but barely

154
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:56,070
hang them and leave their
feet just tiptoeing around

155
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:59,910
in the mud, so that they’re
constantly on their tiptoes

156
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,620
fighting for their life.

157
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:07,930
That is a daily experience when
you are an incarcerated family.

158
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:11,852
You are hanging on by a
rope, tiptoeing in the mud.

159
00:10:11,852 --> 00:10:14,046
Just trying to get
enough solid dirt

160
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:17,462
under your feet to still live.

161
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,350
I keep thinking to
myself, what would it mean

162
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,110
to marry someone behind bars?

163
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,560
What would it look like?

164
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,290
Ten years of waving between bars,
gates, courtrooms and lawyers?

165
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,770
I go to bed at night
holding myself.

166
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:03,950
Not feeling that body heat.

167
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:07,570
Not getting that human contact.

168
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,302
I have dreams that they
are letting him out.

169
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:15,400
And then I wake up,
smiling but still sad.

170
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,350
Still alone.

171
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,800
Still in limbo.

172
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,230
And maybe that’s how
it’s going to be for now.

173
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,190
Held by time.

174
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:28,770
Connected by love,
and love alone.

175
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:41,210
Who we have become now, by the
power of God, kept us strong

176
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,080
and hate-free, babe.

177
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,860
I love you, babe.

178
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,830
You are my forevermore. 
My wife.

179
00:11:50,890 --> 00:00:00,000
Forever.
