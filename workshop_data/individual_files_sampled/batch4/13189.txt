because people are famous we then grant them a certain level of credibility on other issues so the latest example of this is Kanye West so believe it or not the right is now resonating to Kanye West can we remember back to 2005 when after Hurricane Katrina Kanye West went out there and said the george w bush had purposely targeted black people with a hurricane that guy like the guy who jumped on stage with taylor swift and said i'ma let you finish that one so now he's tweeting out deep thoughts and the right is so excited they're so excited because Kanye West is tweeting out things that sound kind of right-wing like he tweeted out that he supports Candace Owens Candace Owens nice gallon friendly with Candice Candice is a she wants to Charlie Kirk over at Turning Point USA she's a black conservative and Kanye West tweeted out that he likes how she thinks and now he tweets out we have freedom of speech but not freedom of thought and then he also tweeted this one out okay that's true I think and then you tweet out the thought police want to suppress freedom of thought okay also true and then he also tweeted out at one point that self victimization isn't is a disease agree agree with all of these things and I'm looking forward to Kanye West tweeting out facts don't care about your feelings like I think it'll be great but the right responded to Kanye West as though it was an earth-shattering thing at a big celebrity like Kanye West was saying things that remotely conservative it just demonstrates the rights desperation to be taken seriously in the in the sphere of pop culture I think that the Roseanne the Roseanne ratings are another evidence of this I think that the right wants to be taken seriously they don't want to be seen as bad evil people and the pop culture decides whose scene is bad and evil pop culture tells you stories and the folks in pop culture decide who gets to be portrayed as the villain and who gets to portrayed as the hero so every time somebody on the right is portrayed as not the villain the right is willing to take it so if Roseanne voted for Trump even if she is Pro cross-dressing and Pro gay marriage and pro promiscuity and pro-abortion well go well you know what at least she's treating us well so we like Roseanne now we're doing the same thing with Kanye West but I would just warn folks on the right you know you can be happy the Kanye West said something that seems to be conservative but let's not pretend the Kanye West is some sort of genius okay
