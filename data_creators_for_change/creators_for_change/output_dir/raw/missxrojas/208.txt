hi everyone happy me<font color="#CCCCCC"> and girls day</font>

00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:03,360
various things happen to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me when the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Sun</font>

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">comes out like I guess I stop being such</font>

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,020
a bitch the main things that I get

5
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,510
really into organizing activities it's

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,550
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> though I'm a huge plant leaf and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

7
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,900
Sun is giving me all sorts of new

8
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,820
creative energy I just need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find an</font>

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,170
outlet for it I don't know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

10
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,510
scientific analogy to that is I didn't

11
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">really take science past juicy sea level</font>

12
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,980
and then so within that part of it is

13
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,199
the activity<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself like trampolining or</font>

14
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,539
gardening or running or cycling or just

15
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,760
generally adventuring but the playing of

16
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,800
it is what i really love planning things

17
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,050

specific house parties while<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cup final</font>

20
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,010

21
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">of planning and scheduling to the point</font>

22
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,489
that it's embarrassing except I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

23
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:46,260
embarrassed by<font color="#CCCCCC"> it anyway</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I don't know</font>

spiral bound books like I've just got

37
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,610
this huge aversion to<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of these sorts</font>

38
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,689
of books for how expensive they were

39

65
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:03,750
