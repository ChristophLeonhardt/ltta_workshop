I am Poison Eve and
I am getting ready for
the 27th annual “Night of 1,000 Stevies”
at Irving Plaza.
This year's theme is Garbo,
and I will be performing
the title track for the 
theme song this year,
which is one of Stevie’s
rarities, called “Garbo.”
“Night of 1,000 Stevies” started 27 years
ago at the infamous night club
Jackie 60 in the
meatpacking district.
I've been attending the
“Night of 1,000 Stevies”
for about 23 years
and been actively
involved in performing
and D.J.ing since 1999.
Here, my boyfriend Jeff,
who is hairdresser, is
slapping on my wig, and
he’s going to glue it down,
because I’m wearing this
incredible three-foot
headdress later
this evening.
The song I performed, “Garbo,”
was sort of a dedication or a memorial
to one of the original Stevies,
Art L’hommedieu, who was my boyfriend
at the time. He passed away in 1999.
So this performance was
was an ode to him and to the
gypsies that remain, as they say.
