1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,760
North Korea has claimed to have detonated its first hydrogen bomb,

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,780
in what's been called the country's largest nuclear test.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,780
Well the international community

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,780
continues to sanction and condemn North Korea's nuclear proliferation

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,780
continues to sanction and condemn North Korea's nuclear proliferation

6
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,780
It's clear that the nation's future

7
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,780
is now more important than ever.

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,780
Will it survive, or will it fall,

9
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,780
and what it happens if it does.

10
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,780
The pro-dominant theory on North Korea's use of nuclear weapon

11
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,780
The pro-dominant theory on North Korea's use of nuclear weapons

12
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,780
is that for now there are negotiation tools more than immediate threat to global security.

13
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,780
is that for now there are negotiation tools more than immediate threat to global security.

14
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,780
In short, many political and military analytics

15
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,780
believe that leader Kim-jong-un refuses to dismantle the country's nuclear arsenal

16
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,780
believe that leader Kim-jong-un refuses to dismantle the country's nuclear arsenal

17
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,780
believe that leader Kim-jong-un refuses to dismantle the country's nuclear arsenal

18
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,780
as every ever serial leader to have done so has been violently deposed.

19
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,780
as every ever serial leader to have done so has been violently deposed.

20
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,780
In both Iraq and Libya,

21
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,780
disarmament has led direct to invasion by the Western forces,

22
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,780
and the brutal deaths of dictators Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi.

23
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,780
and the brutal deaths of dictators Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi.

24
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,780
This decision to continue nuclear proliferation in order to maintain power

25
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,780
This decision to continue nuclear proliferation in order to maintain power

26
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,780
is unstable balance for the North Korean dictator.

27
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,780
is unstable balance for the North Korean dictator.

28
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,780
In an analysis by a think-tank of instability in North Korea suggests that

29
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,780
In an analysis by a think-tank of instability in North Korea suggests that

30
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,780
in the absence of a singular leader

31
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,780
factions among political elites would likely form,

32
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,780
and lead to a deadlocked, non-functioning government,

33
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,780
and lead to a deadlocked, non-functioning government,

34
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,780
and most importantly, food rations would stop,

35
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,780
and that creates a massive problem

36
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,780
for a population that is already closed to starvation.

37
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,780
Problematically,

38
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,780
a desperate, starving and divided population

39
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,780
is incredibly dangerous

40
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,780
for what is technically

41
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,780
the largest military force in the world.

42
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,780
Former soldiers would have nothing to rely on,

43
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,780
leading to high rate of criminal activities to replace government assistance.

44
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,780
leading to high rate of criminal activities to replace government assistance.

45
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,780
as we have seen in other countries whose regime has fallen,

46
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,780
as we have seen in other countries whose regime has fallen,

47
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,780
this pattern of low resources and high crime by former military members

48
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,780
this pattern of low resources and high crime by former military members

49
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,780
has led to violent insurgencies.

50
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,780
ISIS was largely founded by former Iraqi soldiers

51
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,780
have the deposition of Saddam Hussein

52
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,780
Additionally,

53
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,780
North Koreans are brainwashed from a early age

54
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,780
to view the United States and South Korea as aggressors.

55
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,780
to view the United States and South Korea as aggressors.

56
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,780
In the light of facts that these two countries along with China

57
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,780
would likely to be the first to respond an invade

58
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,780
The local populations may find back

59
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,780
assuming the invaders

60
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,780
are there to hurt and not to help

61
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,780
Another major issue would be dealing with

62
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,780
the humanitarian disaster

63
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,780
as 25 million North Koreans

64
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,780
suddenly lose what little foods stored they have.

65
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,780
Food Consumption Country-Wide

66
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,780
is estimated around 15 000 tons per day.

67
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,780
By comparison,

68
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,780
in 2017, the US offers the country

69
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,780
about 5% of that

70
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,780
to help sure the available resources.

71
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,840
So 15,000 tons a day

72
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,840
is an astronomical amount of food,

73
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
and would be incredibly difficult to deliver

74
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,840
while the country undergoes an insurgency

75
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,840
or even a civil war.

76
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,840
It's been predicted that if the North Korean government falls

77
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,840
It's been predicted that if the North Korean government falls

78
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,840
millions would rush into China and South Korea,

79
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,840
neither which have the infrastructure

80
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,840
necessary to handle a massive influx of refugees.

81
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,840
This could create a situation

82
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,840
when North Korea is partitioned by these two countries

83
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,840
when North Korea is partitioned by these two countries

84
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,840
like the Germany in 1940s

85
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,840
The former nation would be split along ideological and political lines

86
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,840
The former nation would be split along ideological and political lines

87
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,840
since South Korea and China are not necessarily allies.

88
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,840
since South Korea and China are not necessarily allies.

89
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,840
Should North Korea fall

90
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,840
it would create a massive humanitarian crisis, a refugee crisis, a civil war

91
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,840
it would create a massive humanitarian crisis, a refugee crisis, a civil war

92
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,840
an insurgency that might have nuclear weapons

93
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,840
and an ideological divide in the Korea peninsula between China

94
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,840
and an ideological divide in the Korea peninsula between China

95
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,840
and US-back South Korea

96
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,840
Hundreds of thousands if not millions of deaths could occur

97
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,840
Hundreds of thousands if not millions of deaths could occur

98
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,840
from just one of these crises

99
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,840
and that scenario is the biggest reason that nobody has done more than sanctions to North Korean leader

100
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,840
and that scenario is the biggest reason that nobody has done more than sanctions to North Korean leader

101
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,840
It is also by Kim-jong-un is unlikely to end his reign of power

102
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,840
It is also by Kim-jong-un is unlikely to end his reign of power

103
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,840
by using nuclear weapons

104
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,840
as it's been the case for nearly 70 years

105
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,840
The uneasy balance has kept the region from collapsing and chaos

106
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,840
The uneasy balance has kept the region from collapsing and chaos

107
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,840
But how long that continues is totally unknown

108
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,840
But even if the government does not collapse

109
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,840
But even if the government does not collapse

110
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,840
day-to-day life for the North Korean population reflects

111
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,840
one of the worst standard of living in the world.

112
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,840
To learn just how difficult it is to live in this tyrannical dictatorship

113
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,840
To learn just how difficult it is to live in this tyrannical dictatorship
