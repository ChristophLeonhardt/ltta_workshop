we discuss what we know about the YouTube shooting Robert Muller announces that President Trump is not a criminal target and president Trump says he's gonna put the military on the border we'll discuss all of it I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show all right so we do have a lot to get to today we're going to go through in Folsom detail everything that we know about the YouTube shooter about the attempted murderer over at YouTube who shot herself after wounding several people we're not going to mention her name because that's something that we don't do here on the bench Shapiro show we also don't do it a Daily wire and that's an edict that I put down after the Parkland shooting where we do not cover the actual name of the shooter so if you want the name of this year you'll have to go elsewhere I don't think it's that important we'll give you all the information you need to know about her without actually naming her and glorifying her in the way that the media are doing we know from studies that it is important of not to mention the names of shooters if you want to stop copycat crimes we'll discuss all of those things in just a second first I want to say thank

began shooting up the place we are not going to mention her name as I say because here at the Daily wire and on my podcast in particular I have a policy my policy is that we don't mention the names of attempted mass shooters because studies tend to show that when you glorify mass shooters all that does is create copycats people want to think that their message is getting out there so what we will discuss is everything we know about this woman what about actually mentioning her specific name just what you need to know as news consumers so according to Mercury News in San Jose the night before this woman opened fire in a courtyard at YouTube's headquarters Tuesday afternoon Mountain View police found this woman sleeping in her car she'd been reported missing by her family in Southern California and her father told police she might be going to YouTube because she hated the company okay so we here's what we know already she's crazy she hates YouTube hey she put up a bunch of videos on YouTube about being demonetised and she's an animal rights protesters within Islamic background her dad is Muslim I guess all I can say is that her videos make it fairly clear that she is not a an orthodox observant Muslim she's dressed in garb that I don't think traditional Muslims would be particularly happy with are there bunch of videos of her doing exercise videos and she was demonetised she had about fifty five thousand followers on Instagram I guess is the is the latest she had a few followers on YouTube and YouTube cracked down on some of her videos and she was very angry at YouTube for that and so her dad called the cops and said she might be going to YouTube the cops obviously did nothing so just like in parkland the cops are told over and over and over there was no follow up and this person obviously was unwell okay I'm not going to sit here and diagnose this person with anything but a person who creates these kind of videos there's some there's a screw loose okay just in conventional terminology this woman had a screw loose after this guy the father called the police the police called the family at 2 a.m. Tuesday to say that this woman had been found that everything was under control but hours later this woman was dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after shooting three people and causing an afternoon of Terror at youtube's headquarters in an interview Tuesday night with the Bay Area News Group this woman's father said his 38 year old daughter told her family a couple of weeks ago the YouTube had been censoring her videos and stopped paying her for her content she was angry he said in an interview it wasn't clear Tuesday night what Mountain View police knew about her history with YouTube a police spokeswoman confirmed that officers had found a woman of the same name asleep in a vehicle early Tuesday morning in a parking lot and the officers made contact with the woman the license plate of her vehicle matched that of a missing person out of SoCal the woman confirmed her identity and answered subsequent questions at the conclusion of their discussion her family was notified that she had been located so according to her dad his daughter was a vegan activist and animal lover as a youngster she would not even kill ants that invaded the family home instead using paper to remove them to the backyard state records show she had once established a charity called peace thunder Inc which sounds fantastic to educate people about animal cruelty environmental pollution and other causes says she's a left-wing activist within Islamic background and choose a vegan and she made weird youtube videos and these videos are really weird and again I'm not gonna show you the YouTube videos because I don't think the future channeling future shooters should have it in their mind that the media are going to give them the sort of coverage they seek if they go and shoot people so according to this woman she was actually quoted by the San Diego union-tribune at a PETA rally in 2009 outside Camp Pendleton the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and she said for me animal rights equal human rights she told her family that YouTube had stopped paying her for the content she posted to the site youtubers of course can receive payments if their videos have been monetized she was prolific on social media she posted videos and photos on Instagram Facebook YouTube it's very weird there's strange war cat video clips graphic animal abuse videos and vegan cooking tutorials but a bunch of her latest posts show evidence of her growing frustration apparently all of her pages were taken down late on Tuesday but for example in a March 18th the Instagram post she railed at YouTube quote all my YouTube channels got filtered by YouTube so my videos hardly get views and it is called merely relegation this also happened to many other channels on YouTube this is the peaceful tactic used on the internet censor and suppress people who speak the truth and are not good for the financial political gains of the system and big businesses I recently got filter on Instagram too and maybe it's related to YouTube and YouTube staff asked to Instagram to filter me here - and then she recorded a video on january 28th where she was complaining about her perceived discrimination by YouTube she said I'm being discriminated and filtered on YouTube but I'm not the only one they restricted my ab workout video Aviva has nothing bad in it nothing sexual she has at least four YouTube channels one in English and then others in Farsi and Turkish as well so the original story that was coming out of the police department is that this was a woman who was angry an ex-boyfriend and so she went into YouTube and started shooting up place it is now clear or at least becoming clear that there's not a lot of evidence for this that it seems more likely that she had a vendetta against YouTube and she decided to just go and start shooting the family apparently came to california from iran in 1996 and apparently this woman was living with her grandmother and she was always complaining that youtube ruined her life so apparently she nobody knows where she got the gun it was not a rifle i believe i believe that this was a handgun and that's what we know about this this woman she would have turned 40 in two days and again she is she had problems it's very clear there's a woman who was mentally ill right and she she said in one video quote they want you to be their sex slaves and not think outside the box they designed for you your knowledge is their enemy this is what she said about youtube her family said she's been making a living as a youtube personality so here's here's what comes out of this first of all the entire left as soon as the shooting went down said okay this obviously means we must have gun control because when you're a hammer everything looks like a nail every single thing looks like a nail and in this particular case the hammer doesn't fit the nail because it's pretty obvious that this woman had serious problems it's not clear where she got the gun yet we don't know the answer depriving me of a gun would not have deprived this woman of a gun at least we don't know that a blank a gun confiscation would have done that this doesn't appear to have been an AR and so this isn't gonna be top-line news for the media for much longer than 24 hours it would have been top-line news if this had been an NRA activist it would've been top-line news if this had been a devotee of the ben shapiro show but since this person is a weird person with mental illness and left-wing leanings and a Muslim background that means this is not going to be news beyond you know the next five minutes then the media is gonna bury this one we'll get right back to Parkland which has a nice narrative the media can Guam on to ignoring of course all the facts about what happened in parkland were the FBI ignored warnings in the local police ignored warnings and then the shooting happened anyway so look for this shooting to hit the back pages in about five seconds flat again because it doesn't promote the agenda that folks wanted to promote the entire Left decided that they were going to jump immediately on this as it was happening and this is one of the problems with social media places like Facebook and in YouTube and Twitter is that people react immediately to all of this stuff as soon as it happens right as soon as it happens people are acting without reference to reality so Michael Ian Black is already tweeting he wants to take away all the guns the comedian is tweeting that he wants to take away everybody's guns he's coming for our guns why do we even have the fact to know we don't have the facts but the narrative must be pervade at all costs and then folks on the right are saying well maybe this woman was a religious Muslim maybe it's a terrorist attack based on the initial report that it was a woman in the headscarf who walked in so nobody actually waits for the facts to come out it's important to wait for the facts to come out because if you don't wait for the facts to come out you screw things up and in this particular case the facts demonstrate that once again we had a mentally ill person who was basically being ignored by the cops and the cops ins what they're supposed to every red flag was there she was she was the police were told that she had a vendetta against YouTube now the other thing that you may see in the coming days is the media tried to turn this into a defense of YouTube's policies suggesting for example that this woman was was egged on by people who were angry at YouTube and angry at social media that she was angered because there are so many people on the right particularly who talked about the problems with D monetization of video now in order to get to that point they would have to ignore the fact that this woman was in fact left-wing and she's rallying with people for the Ethical Treatment of Animals but that wouldn't stop the left before the reality is that every time there is a shooting the left immediately swivels and tries to blame it on the right this goes all the way back to the JFK assassination when the New York Times attempted to blame right-wingers for the JFK assassination even though JFK was assassinated by a communist who may have may or may not have been in contact with the Cuban government they tried to blame it on the right they suggested it was America's collective guilt you may see that emerge in the aftermath of the shooting but now you know what you need to know about the shooter and again it's pretty clear this does not fit into the narrative that the left would like from all of this now what would have stopped something like this presumably a gun violence restraining order if she obtained her weapon legally so some of the stuff that Marco Rubio is pushing and some of the stuff that's been pushed by David French over at National Review the policy that suggests that family and friends could have gone to a judge and said this woman should not have guns because she's a danger to herself or others that would have stopped her from getting a gun what else would have helped well if the police had followed up and ensured that this woman did not have guns after it turns out that she was sleeping in her car and ran Singh about YouTube one of the big problems that we have in American society with regard to the treatment of mental is we act as though a person who rants crazy things and lives in their car is just exercising normal American freedoms hey you don't have the freedom to sleep in your car in public areas and you don't have the freedom to be deeply mentally ill in danger to yourself or others and the ACLU has made a cause a crusade out of ensuring that for example homeless people get to sleep on the streets in Los Angeles it's not this person was not homeless presumably she was living with her parents but she clearly had some problems and when there are problems like this again Jared Lochner the shooter in in in the Gabby Giffords situation the shooter in Aurora Colorado the shooter in in in Sandy Hook the shooter in parkland and all of these people had serious mental health issues serious mental health problems Virginia Tech and there were warning signs and people didn't do what they were supposed to do in just a second I'm gonna get to the other big story of the day and that of course is regarding President Trump and whether he is a target of criminal investigation Robert Romo comes up with some some interesting analysis but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over a policy genius so 71% of people say they need life insurance but only 59% two people have coverage so that's a pretty solid discrepancy a lot of people who say they want life insurance haven't bothered to go get the coverage so 12

Robert Mueller Muller I'm still confused as to how we're actually supposed to pronounce his name so for the sake of argument we will say Muller right now but Robert Muller who is the special investigator who was tasked by the DOJ with checking in to supposed Trump Russia collusion in the last election cycle he has now come out with some information and suggested that President Trump is not in fact a target of the investigation when the the rest of the laughs the entire left is is now doing Bill Paxton from aliens game over man game over they they just they can't believe that Robert Muller isn't gonna come in deus ex machina announced President Trump from office with some sort of criminal indictment here's what the Washington Post reported that blew up the internet last night special counsel Robert a smaller the third informed president Trump's attorneys last month that he is continuing to investigate the president but does not consider him a criminal target at this point according to three people familiar with the discussions in private negotiations in early March about a possible presidential interview Muller described from as a subject of his investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election prosecutors view someone as a subject from that person has engaged in contact that is under investigation but there is not sufficient evidence to bring charges the special counsel also told Trump's lawyer that he's preparing a report about the president's actions while in office and potential obstruction of justice according to two people with knowledge of the conversations mala reiterated the need to interview Trump both to understand whether he had any corrupt intent to thwart the Russian investigation and to complete this portion of his probe the people said no if description of the President status has sparked friction within Trump's inner circle as his advisers have debated his legal standing so the president some of his allies they apparently are seizing on Mullins words as an insurance that Trump it's risk of criminal jeopardy is low but other advisers say well subject can quickly become an indicted target so there are a couple of questions here and some good news for Trump and some bad news for Trump in this report from the Washington Post about what Robert Muller is labeling Trump a target a subject but not a target of the investigation so point number one after a year of investigation more than a year an investigation by the DOJ and about nine months of investigation by team Muller there is no evidence to indict Trump at this point but there isn't so all of the talk about how Trump is on the ropes and Trump is is going to be ousted from office in a criminal station there is not evidence at this point which means that the only evidence that Muller can get is from Trump himself and this brings us right here this brings us to some of the bad news for president Trump when Muller says that President Trump is a target of the a subject but not a target of the investigation what he means is that he's still looking at everything Trump is doing but he doesn't have enough information to indict that could change and so what he could be doing here is making Trump feel comfortable he could be saying to him you know mr. president look I don't have the evidence to indict you right now I have no interest really in inciting you but I need to talk with you to clarify Trump would be a fool to get in a room with Robert Muller and testify under oath he would be or even to talk to the FBI generally because it's still a crime to lie to the FBI even if you're not under oath the reason is this let's say that right now one of the things we know is that Muller is doing two things one is the possible criminal investigation against Trump for obstruction of justice now is that discussed on the program before the case for obstruction against President Trump is particularly weak it's very difficult for the President of the United States to obstruct justice when he is just firing members of the executive branch the president has tremendous control over the executive branch and firing anybody inside the executive branch it's difficult to claim that there would actually be a a solid case against President Trump so I've done this before but I'm gonna do it again let me explain to you what obstruction of justice constitutes under federal law so under 18 US Code 1503 is called the Omnibus clause okay it covers corruptly or by any threatening letter or communication influencing or impeding or endeavoring to influence obstruct or impede the due administration of justice but the clause requires a pending judicial proceeding there is no pending judicial proceeding right now if there were a pending judicial proceeding if for example Trump fired James Comey in order protects Michael Flynn then that would be one thing but if you fired James Comey just because he got mad or if he fired James Comey because he didn't want James Comey investigating him then that would all be actually perfectly legal under this clause it's only if there's a pending judicial proceeding and the president interferes with that pending judicial proceeding by firing someone maybe that you could theoretically say that's obstruction very difficult to make that case when the president obviously has the right to fire someone like James Comey the former FBI director who was underneath his rule right under his per in the executive branch okay another clause of federal law that's often used when you're talking about obstruction is 18 US Code 1512 see this provision of law covers anyone who quote obstructs influences or impedes an official proceeding or attempts to do so so it's not clear that an FBI investigation is an official proceeding and more than that you have to prove intense you have to prove that President Trump actually intended to obstruct the investigation he wasn't just pissed at James Comey I think realistically speaking that's exactly why he fired James Comey the former FBI director he was angry at him because he went to kill me he said why don't you just say I'm not under investigation and Comey said I don't want to say that and Trump said but I'm not am i and cuming said right you're not under investigation from said well why don't you say that and Comey said I don't want it when Trump fired him I mean I think I really I think that's how things went down final piece of the u.s. code that deals with obstruction of justice provision this provision covers destroying evidence related to a federal investigation is 18 US Code 15-19 there are no accusations at this point that Trump has destroyed evidence of any kind so again very difficult to make a criminal case an obstruction of justice against the President of the United States however even if Trump talks to Muller and then he says something like yeah I fired him because I didn't like what he was doing with Flynt boom now you're talking about a possible obstruction of justice charge okay would be difficult to prove in court it would be really out of the box for the President of the United States to be actually charged with obstruction obstruction of justice obstruction of justice was part of the the impeachment proceeding however against Richard Nixon and this brings us to the second point with regard to what Muller is doing so what Muller is doing here right is he is compiling a report to issue to Congress that seems to me perfectly appropriate considering that this is basically a political issue but I'm not sure that it was inside Mulder's purview in the first place now Alan Dershowitz who's a defense lawyer obviously a Harvard Law School professor he has suggested that Muller is operating outside his purview his purview is not to issue reports to Congress his purview is not to issue intelligence or counterintelligence reports his issue is to do a criminal investigation either he's got the goods or he doesn't if he doesn't have the goods then he should shut up that's that's tertian what's his basic point here is that every Special Counsel investigation is set has set parameters and Muller has exceeded those parameters other people who believe this Andy McCarthy over a national view has made the same case that Muller's parameters have expanded and expand and expanded so now we're no longer talking about Trump Russia collusion anywhere in here right Trump Russia collusion has nothing to do with anything instead we are now talking about something completely different possible obstruction of justice by President Trump but this is a problem for President Trump because remember there's an election coming up in 2018 and in just a second I'm gonna explain to you why Muller's little report to Congress could be pretty devastating for President Trump just another reason why Trump probably should not talk to them all I'll explain that in just a second first I

investigation so as we say according to the Washington Post Muller is drafting a large report that he's going to issue to Congress and this of course will be a bombshell no matter what it says if Muller says you know Trump acted improperly but it's not Krim then if Democrats went back Congress they will attempt to impeach him so here is why 2018 matters for Republicans if they don't want to see Trump impeached in the house now the chances that he's impeached in the Senate are virtually no but he could be or convicted in the Senate anyway he could be impeached in the house if Democrats went back to Congress and right now the polls suggest that they are very likely to win back Congress which means let's say mutlar issues this report a few months down the road let's say issues it in December let's say issues in September and this becomes an issue if he issues it before the election Democrats will use this as elect us and we will impeach Trump right hope will spring alive and anew for Democrats and the turnout will be even greater than it otherwise would be because they will now have the grounds to go after President Trump if he does it after the election and Democrats run the house then there will presumably be some sort of impeachment proceeding because all they need is the drop of a hat and they're gonna move to impeach Trump just because they don't like Trump doesn't matter and we've been hearing nothing about collusion doesn't matter the collusion was the buzzword for literally a year and a half here none of that matters they'll talk about obstruction obstruction sure there was no collusion but there was obstruction and the president was acting in criminal fashion and that means we have to impeach him so this is why Trump should not talk to Muller because if he talks to Muller is there any doubt that if you're Trump's lawyer you're just gritting your teeth the entire time if your Trump's lawyer President Trump has an unfortunate habit of making loud brash statements you can't do that in front of lawyers you do that in front of Muller and Muller will catch you in a perjury trap faster than you can say boo so there you actually do have criminal liability right there you actually have a problem if Trump actually lies to the FBI then you have a crime but even if he doesn't lie to the FBI if he provides any evidence that that allows Muller to suggest obstruction that's not quite criminal but it's uncomfortable and weird then you could see Democrats move to impeach President Trump and that of course is the end goal of so many of these folks yeah this investigation is still dangerous now does that mean that Trump should fire Muller no because then there'd presumably be an impeachment proceeding against Trump by the house anyway for obstruction but at least we can fight back if the Muller report proves to be particularly weak everybody is jumping to conclusions suggesting that Trump is off the hook now that's not right everybody who's suggesting that this shows that Trump is on the hook that's not right either we don't have enough information Trump to be protecting himself and if Trump believes that this is going to let him off the hook that it's gonna that everything's gonna be fine this is now in the political court okay this is no longer in the legal Court it probably won't be in a legal court it will be in the political court and that could be a serious problem for president Trump although I will say this if the Democrats try to impeach Trump in 2018 and he doesn't get convicted in the Senate and he remains in office how big is turnout gonna be for Republicans in 2020 and nothing was better for Bill Clinton than republicans attempting to impeach him in 1998 his approval ratings skyrocketed is 60% so I think the same thing will happen with Trump notes I think Trump is a more polarizing figure on the American public scene or at least people react to him in a more polarized way but if Democrats try to impeach him on weak grounds that would be a political mistake that could really hurt them in the in the reelect effort into in 2020 okay so meanwhile the President of the United States President Trump has now decided that he wants to put the military on our southern border and Democrats are losing their minds here as president Trump announcing that he wants to put the military on the border yesterday Louis for a border and we are going to be doing some things I've been speaking with general mattis we're going to be doing things military later until we can have a wall in proper security we're gonna be guarding our border with the military okay so the left went nuts over this so he says listen we don't have proper security we should be guarding our border with the military he says we'll use the National Guard for all of us I think this is a fine move I have no problem whatsoever what the president putting the National Guard on the border this is what he was elected to do he was elected to solidify that border and it's amazing to me that so many members and left are truly upset about all of this what do they think ice is ice is a federal armed force that is on the border this is just supplementing that federal armed force with members of the National Guard and right now there is a serious problem with not just illegal immigration but flow of drugs and crime across that southern border even the Mexican ambassador came out yesterday and said that they they understand president Trump's concerns that you know this isn't completely ridiculous important we certainly understand the concern not only that President Trump has but people in the United States here have about immigration okay so even the Mexican ambassador I think is making some noises that are that are correct here the Mexican government has facilitated illegal immigration this is true seeking government benefits from remittances from from people who cross the border illegally into America and then send money back to their family back in Mexico they have an interest in the sort of cross-border monetary transfers that have been happening into Mexico and that's why Mexico is not anti illegal immigration even though there are anti illegal immigration into Mexico but there's a deeper question at issue here first of all I just want to point this out the reality is that illegal immigration does carry with it serious risks not just in terms of crime but also in terms of the heroin epidemic there's a great book called dreamland by San Wynonna's I've recommended it on the show before and the things that I like and one of the things that one of the things that the book talks about is the fact that the heroin epidemic that's been taking place has largely been pushed by black tar heroin traffickers out of a small town called Alisa Co in the state of Nayarit in Mexico who they take drugs they take drugs they look for new markets and they've set up an entire distribution system all throughout the United States so according to Quinn ona's Mexican drug cartels use customer service they deliver just like pizza delivery and it really appeals to this new class of addicts who are white really kind of unfamiliar maybe a lot of times with the drug world they don't want to get involved in Skid Row or housing projects where everyone has always bought dope a drug addict wants one thing above all and that's reliability and these guys provided that above all they relied on being very low-profile they didn't spend their money lavishly they look like the day workers outside your Home Depot they drove old cars they never used gunplay drive-by shootings or any of that kind of stuff because they didn't need to according to Quinn ona's all these guys don't like selling heroin but here's the thing back in the town where they're from they've been humiliated all their lives their jobs are dead-end jobs they work as Baker's they work as farm boys they work as butchers they don't have anything pushing them ahead and as the business model began to take hold in Jalisco Mexico the effects were immediately seen in the town people began to do better they began to build big houses that again to have nice trucks nice cars all around them young men saw this and they saw that this was a route to real economic progress one of the strangest things I encountered when I was doing this book was how Levi's 501s were these huge forces in pushing the system across the United States that he's very well made very expensive jeans and the system was a system for turning cheap heroin into stacks of Levi's 501s because dealers noticed that addicts they were selling to or fantastic shoplifters so I mean there's a whole system here if the book is really phenomenal and really I think a must-read they talk about the fact that this entire Mexican drug cartel invaded the United States and when people are about to be arrested and deported those people are deported back to the United States did you send people right across the border new people right across the border Trump is not wrong to use the military on the border in order to secure that border but in a second I'm gonna explain to you something amazing and that is why the left is so all-fired enamored really enamored with the idea of keeping the border open and I have a couple of clips to show you and clips to talk about on that but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at Chappaquiddick so as I say if they not sponsor Chappaquiddick to be on the program I would still be talking about Chappaquiddick that's how good the movie is it is a must watch you should go see Chappaquiddick it is coming out on April 6 so just two days from now you can see it I've already seen in the film the film is tremendous not only is it well acted not only is it beautifully shot not only is it beautifully written but it really tells a story about one of the worst crime covers up in the history of the United States that is Ted Kennedy leaving Mary Jo Kopechne in to drown in about six feet of water she actually died suffocating in an air bubble at the top of the car so it wasn't that he left her and she was already drowned she was alive in the car when he left her and then he went home he went to sleep he woke up the next morning and only in the next morning did he call the cops by which point she had suffocated to death in the air bubble at the top of the car all he had to do was walk about 50 feet to a phone make a call to the police and Mary Jo Kopechne would be alive today and if he had by the way Ted Kennedy probably would be President he would have been president but Ted Kennedy did not do that the movie is fascinating in so many ways not just because it paints a really realistic picture of what happened at Chappaquiddick but also because it took 50 years to even got this on the screen which is an incredible thing again imagine the top Republican candidate top Republican contender you know somebody like a George W Bush figure who left a woman who died at the bottom of a river and then was excused with two months of probation right and the two months served was the time served rather than serve a day in jail for any of this imagine how quickly that movie would be made by Hollywood it went for 50 years without a Hollywood movie being made about this but now that movie is out and if you're a conservative and you care about the culture and you care about film you need to go see the movie because you must support films that actually tell the truth even if they're 50 years late go check it out I'm amazed that it was made it's really phenomenal and it does paint a well-rounded I think nuanced picture of Teddy Kennedy at the time and the and the Kennedy family which was replete with scumbags and Liars so go check that out Chappaquiddick this weekend ok so I have a lot more to say about the US military being used to guard the us-mexico border but first you're gonna have to go over

national guardsman on the border makes perfect sense to me I do not see why this is a big problem but there are two groups of people who do have a big problem with this people who are sort of the normal Democrats and then the Radical Democrats so we'll start with the normal Democrats David Gorgon over on CNN has been a longtime democratic political consultant he's angry about this not because the policy is bad but because he thinks president Trump is too militaristic the most disturbing part of the news though to me today was this notion that he's why he wants to snow send troops to the border you know it's true that two past presidents have a deployed National Guard to the board yeah I was because there were pressing needs there's no pressing need here this is more of a political move and it suggests that the president recently sees the military as a play toy that he can make political points with first he wants to have this big massive parade which to most people to military look at and say oh why are we really doing this in the country shrugging his shoulders bees now got the money yeah I wanted to take money out of the military budget and pay for the wall and now he wants to send troops to the border there's no real reason why we need to present troops to the border okay this is ridiculous okay I'm sorry this is just ridiculous George W Bush sent a border deployment of the National Guard known as operation jump started in 2006 it lasted for two full years the operation sent more than 6,000 troops to California Arizona New Mexico and Texas to repair secondary border fence according to CNN and construct nearly 1000 metal barriers and fly Border Protection agents by helicopter to intercept immigrants trying to enter illegally and then another President did this too does anyone remember I don't remember remember all the way back to 2010 when Barack Obama did this hey Barack Obama deployed National Guard troops as part of a border protection plan in 2010 they said up to 1200 National Guard troops would be in place along the us-mexico border for up to a year to assist US Customs and Border Protection so Democrats are upset with this because the guy who's doing its name is Trump otherwise they wouldn't care but the suggestion that Trump sees the military as a plaything and that's why he's doing this Trump literally campaigned on solidifying the border that's what he campaigned on so there is no problem here that's absurd but there's a deeper problem and that is you know I was asked yesterday by it by somebody specifically about this issue why are so many Democrats why are so many folks on the radical interested in open borders and I said because there's a group of people who really believe that America bears blood guilt for all of the problems in the rest of the world they look at America they see America's rich America's powerful but a lot of people all over the world who are poor who are not powerful lots of countries all over the world where people are suffering that's our fault because we're rich and powerful in their view world politics is a zero-sum game well just demonstrating this tucker carlson had on last night a fellow who calls himself a border angel his name is reka Enrique morones he is a person who attempts to smuggle people across the border he's a founder of the the caravan of migrants that was headed to the US via the us-mexico border from Central and Latin America and here he is the tucker carlson explaining why he thinks that it's fine to smuggle people across the border and in tucker yeah does a good job with with both making the the famed tucker carlson face as well as as well as quizzing this guy in the united states interfering in these countries the demand for the drugs invading the sovereign land like iraq or interfering the civil wars or central america that causes people to flee the u.s. Martians are the reason you hate Americans what you're saying very good actually you're blaming America for legal immigration into America okay and that that is essentially what he's saying Tucker knows a good job of boiling it down there but this guy is saying that America is responsible for sins all over the world so America should take in all of the refugees from those sins so a couple of things that are weird about that number one if you really think America is such a terrible place filled with such awful people why do you why do people want to get in right if a country victimized my country and destroyed my country and made my country a red state why would I want to live in the country that just wrecked my state why would I want to be a citizen of the country that is apparently just a predatory force around the globe that's that's a weird logical gap maybe just for the materialistic gain I suppose but the other point here is that there is an actual attempt by some members of the radical left to castigate America for our global sins again the idea being that America is bad and America must be punished too much of America's foreign policy from the left has been based on this when Barack Obama did his fabled apology tour Oh the Middle East in Europe after he was elected this was the basic message America has sinned in the world and we are here to rectify those sins and if that means that we have to curb our economy with the Paris Accords cracking down on American economic growth for the sake of KY miracle environmental gain then we will do it everything will be fine because we deserve it we deserve it it's our fault right and if it comes to propping up the UN one of the most useless in nefarious institutions in the history of modern of modern politics if we have to do that in order to slap America itself we'll do that because America is a guilty place filled with guilty people and they have to pay now this view of the left is a really dangerous one and if you're wondering why politics has become so polarized and so so yelling and so screaming it's because there's no way to have a rational conversation with people who legitimately believe that the United States has to pay for its past sins and that virtually everything counts as an American sent some president Trump says is gonna put people on the border I'm all in on that I think that's a perfectly rational thing to do and I also think that the illegal immigration crisis is not all that hard to solve it's just that there are a bunch of people on the Left particularly who don't want that crisis solved they want more illegal immigration because they think that America ought to pay on a moral level that's on the radical left it's not every Democrat you know there are many other Democrats who don't want to solve the illegal immigration situation because they believe that they're going to be able to get additional Democratic voters as people are made citizens or they believe that for example a bunch of people are going to vote Democrat if they see nasty pictures of Republicans pushing for deportations it's a political football but again this core group of leftists who believe that America is a bad a bad force in the world and therefore we must be punished by taking in all sorts of refugees and immigrants that's that's dangerous stuff and there's no way that the United States can can survive with that sort of perspective becoming more and more common okay and just as so now I want to talk about something that really weird that happened yesterday this is a weird thing that happened yesterday to me so I have become friendly with a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school whose name is Kyle Kashyap he first started becoming prominent when he was speaking out in favor of gun rights even though he was a witness to what happened at the Parkland element at the Parkland High School and entire left basically ignored him and so I pointed out to the media that they should stop ignoring survivors who disagreed with them and so he started getting booked a little bit more and one of the things that has happened in the past couple of days is that there are a bunch of people on the Left who have attacked him and the reason this is relevant is because of course there was this massive boycott launched against Laura Ingraham by the left suggesting that she'd been mean to another parkland survivor named David Hogg David Hogg of course had been the kid who'd gone on TV and suggested that everyone who disagreed with him was basically a murderer with blood on their hands taking NR a blood money and Laura Ingraham said that he was whining about his college admissions and ill-advised comment and then there was a boycott against her well Kyle was attacked in much more nefarious fashion by the left and no one seems to be commenting on this other than to say that the guy who did it is kind of crazy so the guy who did it is a guy named Kurt - Wald Kurt Eisenwald on his bio on his bio on Twitter five days ago it said he was an MSNBC contributor and a vanity fair a contributing editor right that's what it said on his on his biography well a few days ago he ripped into Kyle on Twitter I pointed this out and MSNBC started losing sponsors and so MSNBC came out and said well actually we would not hired him for since February 24 since February he hasn't been able to to really do anything since February hasn't been with MSNBC so first court had to had to remove the MSNBC contributor part of his Twitter profile so suddenly it just said Kurt I can Wald Vanity Fair contributing editor New York Times best-selling author okay then yesterday Kurt sent me this wild email this wild wild email and here's what its heads had been I'm working on an article about you and your relationship with Kyle cash of the kid from parkland I'm not gonna be using his name for reasons that will become apparent a few items one he's been actively working to trick journalists he believes work for non Fox television networks into taking any action in something in which his Twitter account was linked to he's been cordoning with some of the trolls involved with these people three he in fact coordinated with the other guy with the podcast who was demanding my respect he is the same attack on me as the other guy which was unprovoked he used this garbage pushed by conservative media and leftist that I am a fan of tentacle porn and that's that's what he actually wrote because about a year ago it turned out that Kurt I can Wald tweeted out a link accidental - tentacle porn and I think that was the story and and/or he tweeted out a picture of himself in the background of his computer was a picture of tentacle porn something like that and then he said that he was just using it for research purposes or he wanted to show his kids he was his kids had said something about tentacle porn didn't believe that it was real so he went looking for it in any case this became a point of humor against current I can walled and this email that he sent to me about Kyle goes on and on and on and on I mean it is a long long email and the best part of it was where he says this so remember all of this started with Kurt I can Wald saying that the boycott against Laura Ingraham was justified because Laura Ingraham had been mean to a park land survivor Kyle cash-flow at i/o cashew is a park land survivor here is what Kurt I can well wrote in this email to me that he sent to me this crazy email quote I engaged in ADM conversation with Kyle which was quite disturbing I consulted a friend of mine who is a psychiatrist a political conservative since that seems so important to you and based on what he read the psychiatrist said the following one Kyle is in desperate need of psychiatric help or support the psychiatrist did not have enough information to assess if the issues he saw in the conversation where the consequence of the shooting being psychologically unprepared for being thrust into the conservative media as a go-to kid or if there's an underlying pathology that preceded these events - Kyle is obsessed with you in fact our DM conversation with you which involves a lot of irrational rage seems to have been sparked by my asking you to debate and then he goes on and finally the very end of this email he asks a series of questions suggesting that I am running Kyle that I am the nefarious for it the Kyle doesn't have his own opinions he wasn't conservative before he met me that Kyle has been getting his cues from me now listen I've openly said on the program that I talked with Kyle feel like there's no secret about this I think Kyle is a good kid I think he's trying to do the right thing and I think he deserves support in the same way that I'm sure that David hog talks with a bunch of folks on the Left including Media Matters there's nothing wrong with that but the best part of this email is where Kurt says at the very end of it don't forward this email to Kyle he does not need to know what a psychiatrist is saying about him you have heard him enough so this guy who purported to be a Vanity Fair contributing editor he sends me an email accusing Kyle Kash of a parkland survivor of being psychologically deficient right to having a psychiatric problem and then says at the end of the email that I am harming him and I shouldn't afford the email so naturally I did what any rational person would do when you receive a crazy email like this I immediately posted it on Twitter the entire text of it and Vanity Fair responded by sending out a notice that Kurt I can wall no longer works for Vanity Fair that he hasn't worked for Vanity Fair for several years so Kurt's Twitter biography shrunk yet again and now he was no longer a nemesis MSNBC contributor or a Vanity Fair contributing editor he he actually emailed I believe his brian Stelter CNN claiming that no he was still a Vanity Fair contributing editor and vaneeta was like that no you're not and you haven't written for us since 2014 so all of this is to say listen I don't want to pick on a guy when he's down pick a guy when he's down but all of this is to say that there are people on the Left who do attack parkland survivors and the blowback on them does not extend to their to their venues it doesn't really extend to their outlets it's been largely ignored right John Walsh as we played yes as we use and played yesterday said some nasty things about Kyle cash there's been no boycott effort against CNN when the left wants to boycott something they're doing it for political purposes the right usually is better than that and usually doesn't engage in these kind of boycotts unless it is a reverse boycott like they're boycotting chick-fil-a and we say okay we'll all go shop at chick-fil-a just to show that we're not going to allow you to boycott institutions we like out of business but it's amazing what the same left that says you can't target a parklands shooter it can't target rather a parkland survivor will say that if it's a power Clin survivor we don't like that we will actually go have them psychologically evaluated without their knowledge and then say that you should not tell the person that that happened it's an amazing thing and frankly I think the kyle has a very solid legal case for defamation against Curt so we'll see how all of that goes but things certainly are crazy okay time for a couple of things I like and then a couple of things that I hate so things that I like since it is the middle of Passover I would be remiss if I did not play some music from The Prince of Egypt I remember when I first saw this movie as an Orthodox Jew I found a couple of things a little irritating about it because it's not exactly biblically accurate in a couple of ways so for example they use the trope that is used I believe in the original Ten Commandments as well that the the king of Egypt is the same age as Moses right that Pharaoh is the same age as Moses they're actually brothers their adopted brothers not that Pharaoh was older the there's not a lot of evidence in the Bible that Pharaoh was in fact Moses his adopted brother as opposed to Moses adoptive father but in any case the movie itself is worth watching it is quite good it was I believe the first DreamWorks major animation film if I'm not mistaken and the music and Stephen Schwartz the same guy who did wicked and the rest of music in the film is done by Hans Zimmer who of course has gone on to have an enormous career doing things like Christopher Nolan's Batman movies and interstellar right here is the first number in the in the musical deliver us which is the best number in the whole show all righty so go check it out it's really a great number and the Prince of Egypt is well worth watching okay time for a very quick thing that I hate so Steven Spielberg says it is time for a woman to play Indiana Jones oh say here's what he said he said he knew he would risk phantom fury by casting an actress in the role made famous by Harrison Ford but believes it his time the Explorer took a different form he make the expenditure owns like a dog or something I guess I mean it any different form will work apparently an exclusive interview Spielberg nodded when asked if this new look Jones could be female and added we'd have to change the name from Jones to Joan and there would be nothing wrong with that he's been a vocal champion of The Times up campaign for gender equality in the movie industry and of course he was married to the actress Kate Capshaw since 1991 he met her in 1984 she starred in Indiana Jones in the Temple of Doom she's an awful actress by the way I mean that in in Temple do my goodness whoa that's a stinker but in any case he says my mom was strong she had a voice she had a very strong opinion actually I knew his mom and she used to run a kosher restaurant on Pico Boulevard called milk and honey which is quite good but he says that he thinks this will be Harrison Jones Harrison Ford's last Indiana Jones movie would have to be because Harrison Ford is pushing 80 at this point he's really getting up there it's Indiana Jones and the and the kingdom of the actual skull is where we are at this point but when you have Steven Spielberg's saying that we're gonna take iconic male characters and then shift them to female I've said this before I find it really stupid one of the things that's great about film one things that's great about art is that specificity is universality so the more specific the character is the better the art is because in specific we see what we have in common with other people when you draw a person really well what you see is what I have in common with that person and that's universal if you draw people broadly so broadly that you can legitimately just take a woman and put in a man's role then it's not good it's not like I think this is the reason that the movie atomic blonde didn't do well at the box office it was because basically Charlize Theron is playing a male role but she's just a woman and I guess this is for female equality or somesuch but it's okay to have a female action star who's a woman right I mean Ridley Scott did it with aliens with Sigourney Weaver and it works fine because guess what Sigourney Weaver plays a woman and she plays a woman like a woman and she's very aggressive woman film obviously but she plays it like a woman and you couldn't put a man in that role and have them read the same lines the whole point of Indiana Jones Indiana Jones is a dude he's a dudes dude and this is the same sort of conversation we've had about a female James Bond there should not be a female James Bond James Bond is a character with a specific personality that is male in orientation and the same thing is true with regard to with regard to Indiana Jones don't take iconic characters and just make them women build a new character if field wants to build a new female character go for it it's all you but it's irritating to suggest that women and men are exactly the same and therefore you can just pop a woman in a man's role and it's totally fine no problem whatsoever okay we'll be back here tomorrow with all the latest updates I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is
