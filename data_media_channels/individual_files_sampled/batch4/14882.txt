it looks like teresa may could be backtracking over the customs union The Sunday Times reported that Theresa May could be prepared to surrender over the customs union issue last week the Lord's voted in favor of remaining within the customs union and we know that most of parliament are against leaving the customs union to its labor policy to stay in it and it's reported that Mays top team will not be crying into their beer if they're forced to look at remaining within the Union I have to admit even though I knew that Mae was a remainer I've always believed her when she said Briggs it means breaks it I mean her legacies on the line and so's her job she doesn't even have a majority in parliament so her positions pretty fragile so pulling off the brexit victory for 52 percent of British voters would be a huge draw for her but perhaps the pressures just getting too much may face is a huge stumbling block with the heart bordering Ireland if we left the customs union it's almost inevitable that there would have to be a hard border we'd need to ensure some kind of barrier between Northern Ireland and the Republic when one sides EU and one's not that's a politically toxic issue and something no politician would ever want to be responsible for and staying in the customs union keeps the parliamentarians and the lords happy but I tell you what it's gonna piss off the voters that's probably music to the ears of struggling you KITT right now so May won't get away with this so easily if she does decide to take the easy route and just stay within the customs union by the way her staying in the customs union means we don't get breaks it we didn't vote for a bit of brexit we voted to leave the EU period but it looks like people in Teresa's own party real Democrats who believe in representing their constituents at least on the EU issue are pushing back to cabinet ministers have even publicly warned the PM against the move Sajid Javid said British people gave politicians clear instructions through EU referendum includes leaving the customs union an intrinsic part of the EU Britain must leave the CU and be able to negotiate and sign own trade deals and Michael Gove echoed that statement and he said Sajid is right the referendum vote was clear we need to take back control of trade that means leaving the protectionist customs union once again true one of the big campaign issues a couple of years ago was opening Britain up to the world and staying in the customs union just keeps us tied to EU policy and hinders our economic and trade freedom if may really does go down this route then she could face a huge backlash the be a cabinet revolt that could be there has been talk of a leadership challenge for the last year or so as well a u-turn on this issue could cause it one MP told conservative home that if there's a cave in on the customs union I think there will be a leadership challenge some are saying that a u-turn on the issue could result in break cities including foreign secretary Boris Johnson as well as Liam Fox to resign and that's good we need politicians to be tough with her and make an even face a vote of no-confidence and then there's the fact that she's just about to be tested in the local elections I've already made my predictions on this in a recent rebel video and I don't think it's gonna go well for the Tories but let me make one more prediction if Teresa may really does this if she betrays brexit and keeps us in the customs union I think her government will become unstable there'll be a leadership challenge and then Jeremy Corbyn will once again start harping on about forming his own government remember we've got a minority government right now it's not out of the realm of possibility that Corbin and others join forces and managed to form their own coalition government can you imagine just how disastrous that would be there's another possibility too it's possible that our leadership challenge results in somebody like Jacob Riis Marc taking charge as p.m. that would be great for Bragg's it though Marc isn't without its faults I'll talk about that another time but in the meantime let's hope that conservative MPs and cabinet members keep up the pressure Teresa we know the job is hard but stick addict get Briggs it done and the voters will reward you for it all from me and the rest of the rebel team remember to download our app on the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store and like and subscribe you
