00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,090
to start enjoying<font color="#E5E5E5"> some time off for the</font>

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,330
holidays I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about how when</font>

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,550
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> a kid in school you always get a</font>

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,090
Christmas break and then in college you

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,529
get even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of a Christmas break</font>

9
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:25,199
sometimes more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than a month of time that</font>

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,029
you have completely to yourself and it's

11
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:28,710
fun because that time is yours to do

12
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,689
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want you can work on</font>

13
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,140
projects or see friends or just sit

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,850
around and do nothing at all and then

15
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:36,930
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're an adult you don't get</font>

16
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,760
breaks anymore and you realize how much
