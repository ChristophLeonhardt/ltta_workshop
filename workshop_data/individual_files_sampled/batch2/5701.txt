I'll tell you and now I think not enough people are reading the report there quickly issuing their press releases let me ask you this how's this being received inside the Justice Department and inside the FBI in two ways the large the overall conclusions here I think everybody pretty much expected this there have been sort of leaks around we have to remember that the IG report was actually finished some time ago and then sent around and draft to the various people who are mentioned in it and the various entities that are injured and mentioned so the broad outlines we've known that the IG would conclude that there was no deep state conspiracy here to hurt either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump it does it's pretty hard on Comey combing himself has responded by saying I disagree with some of the findings but I find it reasonable I think the most troubling part of this both here at justice and across the street at the FBI is this new disclosure of the Peter struck response remember that the Lisa page email saying he's not gonna get elected is he actually came out earlier what what's new today is the response from Peter struck saying no no will stop but now here's what's being said about that number one that what the IG says here is that at the time this came out it was in August remember a month later the Anthony Weiner emails were discovered and more Clinton emails were found on Anthony Weiner's laptop so one of the questions of the report is why did it take the FBI a month to get off the dime and aggressively go after those emails issue a subpoena and start getting into them what the IG says is that's well Chuck I'm being told I have to stop here but let me just finish this one thought the IG report says several people were involved in making that decision that struck was one of them and that they the IG says we can't conclude that he was free from bias and making that decision his lawyer has said look he was trying to decide which is more important to Russia meddling investigation or the Clinton email thing which was largely over and that's why he did what he did one other point we were all interested to see whether this report would say anything about whether FBI agents in New York were leaking to Rudi jewel Jonnie about the discovery of the emails the report doesn't address that the IG says the issue of leaks is under investigation that was a very I noted that and that was a very interesting thing as if it's a now separate investigation I noticed Rudy Giuliani told me he was interviewed by the IG but that interview was not noted in this report and it made me assume oh there may be a second report coming is that what we assumed Pete well I don't know if there's gonna be a second IG report coming but the issue of leaks they say is is under investigation whether they'll do a report or not I don't know hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our channel so thank you now do me a favor subscribe by clicking on that button down there click on any of the videos to watch the latest interviews and highlights from MTV daily and MSNBC you get more Meet the Press content every morning and the first read newsletter if you're tired of content that you don't know anything about where it came from you don't have to have that problem with us NBC News MSNBC MTP and the Meet the Press mind set right here for you on YouTube subscribe now
