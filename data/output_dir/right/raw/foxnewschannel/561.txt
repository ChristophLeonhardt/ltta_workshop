>> GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS.

4
00:00:07,316 --> 00:00:15,357
BRIAN: KELLYANNE CONWAY SAID

5
00:00:15,357 --> 00:00:16,091
THERE'S A LEFT -- VAST LEFT-WING

6
00:00:16,091 --> 00:00:16,925
CONSPIRACY WORK.

7
00:00:16,925 --> 00:00:17,559
>> OLIVER TO WATCHED THE

8
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,260
INTERVIEW LAST THEY COULDN'T

9
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:18,894
HELP BUT FEEL FOR THE GUY.

10
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:19,561
WHEN I WATCHED IT I THOUGHT

11
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,329
ABOUT MY DAD, MY BOYFRIEND, ALL

12
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:23,299
THE MALE FRIENDS I HAVE IN MY

13
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:24,033
LIFE AND HOW IT WOULD FEEL TO GO

14
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:26,635
THROUGH THIS.

15
00:00:26,635 --> 00:00:27,403
YOU COULDN'T HELP BUT BE TOUCHED

16
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:27,903
BY THAT INTERVIEW.

17
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,706
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING

18
00:00:30,706 --> 00:00:31,440
WHAT HAPPENS THURSDAY BUT IT IS

19
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,743
NOT ONLY A LEFT-WING CONSPIRACY

20
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:42,217
BUT JUST WRONG.

21
00:00:42,217 --> 00:00:42,951
PETE: WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED 36

22
00:00:42,951 --> 00:00:43,652
YEARS AGO AND NO ONE HAS BEEN

23
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:44,353
ABLE TO CORROBORATE THE STORY

24
00:00:44,353 --> 00:00:45,054
AND PEOPLE WHO SAY WHAT IF IT

25
00:00:45,054 --> 00:00:46,755
WAS YOUR DAUGHTER THAT IS A

26
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:50,726
GREAT POINT BUT WHAT IF IT WAS

27
00:00:50,726 --> 00:00:51,093
YOUR SON?

28
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:51,794
AND ALL OF US AND YOU WAKE UP

29
00:00:51,794 --> 00:00:54,730
AND HAVE TO DEFEND YOURSELF

30
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:58,734
AGAINST CHARGES THAT YOU SAY

31
00:00:58,734 --> 00:00:59,468
NEVER HAPPENED AND EVERYONE HAS

32
00:00:59,468 --> 00:01:03,505
A STAKE IN THIS RESULTS.

33
00:01:03,505 --> 00:01:04,239
>> LIKE I SAID ON TWITTER LAST

34
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,709
NIGHT, THOSE WHO ARE STILL VOCAL

35
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:07,443
ON THE LEFT ESPECIALLY THE MEN

36
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:08,177
THAT ARE SO VOCAL ON THE LEFT,

37
00:01:08,177 --> 00:01:14,884
TO TALK ABOUT THE SURVIVOR AND

38
00:01:14,884 --> 00:01:15,618
THE ALLEGATIONS I WOULD REMIND

39
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:16,352
THEM IT ONLY TAKES ONE PERSON TO

40
00:01:16,352 --> 00:01:17,086
COME OUT AGAINST THEM FROM WAY

41
00:01:17,086 --> 00:01:21,457
BACK IN THEIR PAST OR PRESENT,

42
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:22,158
THEIR CAREER, THEIR FAMILIES

43
00:01:22,158 --> 00:01:22,892
COULD BE RUINED SO BEFORE THEY

44
00:01:22,892 --> 00:01:29,699
ARE SO QUICK TO ATTACK HIM AND

45
00:01:29,699 --> 00:01:30,366
BELIEVE HE IS GUILTY UNTIL

46
00:01:30,366 --> 00:01:31,033
PROVEN INNOCENT THEY ARE TO

47
00:01:31,033 --> 00:01:31,734
REMEMBER AND WATCH THEMSELVES.

48
00:01:31,734 --> 00:01:32,335
>> WE HAD JUDGE ANDREW

49
00:01:32,335 --> 00:01:34,137
NAPOLITANO ON THE SHOW AND HE

50
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:34,837
SAID THE BURDEN OF PROOF HAS

51
00:01:34,837 --> 00:01:37,473
BEEN ON THEIR SIDE.

52
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:38,174
THE PERCEPTION IS REALITY ON

53
00:01:38,174 --> 00:01:42,712
THURSDAY.

54
00:01:42,712 --> 00:01:43,412
THE PERCEPTION DEPENDS ON WHO

55
00:01:43,412 --> 00:01:45,882
YOU ARE FOLLOWING, WHAT CHANNEL

56
00:01:45,882 --> 00:01:59,862
YOU ARE WATCHING, WHO YOU FOLLOW

57
00:01:59,862 --> 00:02:00,563
ON SOCIAL MEDIA, HOLLYWOOD IS

58
00:02:00,563 --> 00:02:01,230
PUTTING OUT THESE CAMPAIGNS.

59
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:01,964
>> HOLLYWOOD IS THE LAST PLACE

60
00:02:01,964 --> 00:02:02,665
THEY SHOULD BE COMING OUT IN

61
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:03,366
DROVES CONSIDERING THEIR PAST.

62
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:04,100
I KNOW THEY ARE HOME TO THE ME

63
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:04,834
TOO MOVEMENT, I CALL IT THE WE

64
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:05,334
ALL KNEW MOVEMENT.

65
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:06,736
I HOLLYWOOD ACTORS, COMING OUT

66
00:02:06,736 --> 00:02:07,470
SO VOCALLY, NOTHING TO CAMPAIGN

67
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,707
ON FOR THE MIDTERMS, THEY WANT

68
00:02:10,707 --> 00:02:13,576
TO DISTRACT FROM ALL THEIR

69
00:02:13,576 --> 00:02:14,310
FAILURES AND FOCUS ON THIS POOR

70
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,044
MAN WHO IS QUALIFIED, IT WAS A

71
00:02:15,044 --> 00:02:18,548
GOOD MAN, A FAMILY MAN, TO

72
00:02:18,548 --> 00:02:19,249
DISTRACT FROM EVERYTHING THEY

73
00:02:19,249 --> 00:02:19,682
ARE NOT DOING.

74
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:22,719
BRIAN: MICHELLE OBAMA HAS A BOOK

75
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,723
COMING OUT WITH HER HUSBAND, JOE

76
00:02:26,723 --> 00:02:29,626
BIDEN, TALKING ABOUT THE PAST

77
00:02:29,626 --> 00:02:30,326
ADMINISTRATION, LISTEN TO HER

78
00:02:30,326 --> 00:02:30,793
PLAN OF ACTION.

79
00:02:30,793 --> 00:02:35,532
>> I AM SICK OF ALL THE CHAOS

80
00:02:35,532 --> 00:02:36,166
AND THE NASTINESS OF OUR

81
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:42,705
POLITICS.

82
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:47,010
IT IS EXHAUSTING AND FRANKLY

83
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:47,410
DEPRESSING.

84
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,144
YOU CAN'T VOTE SOME OF THE TIME

85
00:02:48,144 --> 00:02:48,645
AND THEN SIT OUT.

86
00:02:48,645 --> 00:02:49,179
WE SAW THAT HAPPEN.

87
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:49,712
WE EXPERIENCED THAT.

88
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:53,049
WE HAD A GREAT PRESIDENT.

89
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:58,888
BRIAN: WE HAD A GREAT PRESIDENT.

90
00:02:58,888 --> 00:02:59,622
>> BY WHAT MEASURE I WOULD ASK,

91
00:02:59,622 --> 00:03:02,725
WAS HER HUSBAND A BETTER

92
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:03,393
PRESIDENT THAN THE CURRENT

93
00:03:03,393 --> 00:03:06,729
PRESIDENT.

94
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:07,464
NOT THAT KIND OF GROWTH, NOT IN

95
00:03:07,464 --> 00:03:08,198
POOR SECURITY, NOT INDEPENDENT

96
00:03:08,198 --> 00:03:08,898
RELATIONS, NOT IN MAKING THE

97
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:09,632
UNITED STATES AND AMERICA FIRST

98
00:03:09,632 --> 00:03:10,734
STRONG ON THE INTERNATIONAL

99
00:03:10,734 --> 00:03:14,704
INTERNATIONAL STAGE ONCE AGAIN.

100
00:03:14,704 --> 00:03:15,438
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE IS LOOKING

101
00:03:15,438 --> 00:03:18,742
AT BUT BEYOND THAT THE DEMOCRATS

102
00:03:18,742 --> 00:03:21,211
REALLY THINK THAT MICHELLE AND

103
00:03:21,211 --> 00:03:21,945
BARACK ARE WHAT THEY NEED, THEY

104
00:03:21,945 --> 00:03:22,712
DIDN'T DO IT IN 2016, COULDN'T

105
00:03:22,712 --> 00:03:23,413
SHOW UP FOR HILLARY, COULDN'T

106
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:26,983
GET PEOPLE OUT IN THAT ELECTION

107
00:03:26,983 --> 00:03:27,717
BUT NOW SOMEHOW WE ARE SUPPOSED

108
00:03:27,717 --> 00:03:30,720
TO FOLLOW MICHELLE AND BARACK

109
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,421
OBAMA AND THAT WILL SAVE THE

110
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:32,122
DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND I DON'T

111
00:03:32,122 --> 00:03:34,024
THINK SO.
