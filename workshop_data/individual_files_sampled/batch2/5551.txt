what's a way forward here do you think this needs to be aired out in a confirmation hearing or do you think the White House should withdraw the nomination no I think we I think we need to get the bottom of it I'm still not confident that that that Admiral Jackson is not confirmable on these grounds I think we need to get to the factory I don't think he could be confirmable well I think there's a possibility he could be confirmable now he has some other issues other than these issues that I think both sides the aisle are concerned about about budget his ability to budget such a massive budget as the VA and and his ability to to lead but some of these allegations go directly to his ability to lead and quite frankly that that's why we need to get to the facts let me ask you a question about whether dr. Jackson's been the subject of an IG report it's our understanding dr. Jackson said he was not did he deny being a subject of an IG report to you senator tester he has not denied it to me but I have seen parts of that IG report I've been very very busy today so I have mendler read through it all but he was absolutely a subject of an IG report him and his predecessor so and that I've seen some of those allegations it's my understanding that people said it was more about his predecessor than him is that a fair reading of that IG report or is it pretty damning on him as well I think it's then I think is equally damning on both of them Eric quickly I want to circle back dr. Jackson he's still confirmable in your eyes if he's if he answers these allegations to your satisfaction I think he's still I think there's still a potential of a confirmation hearing and a vote okay you said hearing in a vote that doesn't mean you got the big chest ire cat smile on there is there any change I would vote to confirm him to be be a secretary you senator Jon Tester I'm not there yet we still have more work to do with the allegations that have been put forth into claims and more scrutiny on his ability to handle a budget as big as a v8 and the people under him hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this to see lots of other great videos
