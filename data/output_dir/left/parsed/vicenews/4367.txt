this is cool Mack return of the Mac it's
pretty classic songwriting that's one of
the things he obviously is aware of the
craft and that's something that I
appreciate I feel uh delightfully
seasick every time I hear stuff makes me
feel like I'm on a boat somewhere with a
cocktail my hand guess I'm just too
scared okay I'm just
you're quick to take your headphones off
yeah that makes me want to drink more
who is it

seems like a nice guy like guy he could
be best friends with man I've been
trying as I get older to not trash

lovin you inside your love is like a
copy this is cool thank you buddy

waiting here the chorus for time yeah

thought it's going to be different than
that little little yachty yeah like a
yacht with a why a seaman I think it's
gonna take

I feel like I could hear 15 seconds of
the song and guess what the rest of the
songs you sound like put it down and
probably within about a 90 percent
chance be right who is it
Lady Antebellum you know I thought they
were like sophisticated country
