talk about feminism isn't really to talk

38
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,740

52
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,799
Kate Nash just lose control bouncing on

53
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">the stage where everybody around you is</font>

we can error and it made me<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

60
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,899
think about a future where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can stop</font>

61
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,840
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> feminism which would be</font>

62
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,460
great wouldn't it I think it's what some

63
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,649
people and forget is that you know if

64
00:01:58,649 --> 00:01:59,520
you're a feminist you're trying to work

65
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,350
yourself out the job I didn't wanna keep

66
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,340
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this forever this isn't</font>

67
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,659
you just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep exist utiful get</font>

68
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,009
on with existing and that's what these

69
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:06,840
women were doing and for that I raised

70
00:02:06,840 --> 00:00:00,000
my bra to them
