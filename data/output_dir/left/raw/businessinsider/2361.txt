5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,140
year what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> at those warehouses</font>

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,289
how do you get all that stuff to people

7
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:28,509
well we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big picking and packing</font>

8
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:31,840
team out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the at the brooklyn naval</font>

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,969
yards but we just started working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

10
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:37,840
another company and and we opened a

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,059
second warehouse up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Andover Mass that</font>

12
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:43,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">uses the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Kiva robots which if you</font>

13
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,269
haven't seen them are incredibly cool

14
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:48,969
they do the picking part of the pick and

15
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:52,539
pack and they use 2d barcodes to figure

16
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:55,179
out where the product is and they are

17
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:57,749
constantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving around the space</font>

18
00:00:57,749 --> 00:01:00,909
bringing the goods to the packer so it's

19
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:03,729
incredibly efficient so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge</font>

20
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:05,890
warehouse huge was just stuff all over

21
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,420
the place yeah you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got these little</font>

22
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,550
boxes run around is there a central

23
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,650
brain somewhere that tells them where to

24
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,050
head yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find and I can't tell you</font>

25
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,670
what that is so there's a central brain

26
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,380
that knows these little boxes right and

27
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,170
they look yeah they find the barcode I

28
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,509
don't look they find the barcode on the

29
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:25,270
floor sunday they are sensing it where

30
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,810
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they bring that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pallet over</font>

31
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,600
lots of stuff without just a daughter

32
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,060
absolutely lots of stuff in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

33
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,700
packer picks one of those and it goes

34
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,380
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the box and meanwhile there's</font>

35
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,380
another keeper robot bringing the next

36
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,130
item<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's very quick it's very</font>

37
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,619
efficient you don't lose goods nobody's

38
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:49,539
allowed in that space except the robots

39
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:51,340
so you get them scurrying all over the

40
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,930
place they crash into each other never

41
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,049
you don't have robot accidents never

42
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,030
never and so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're selling dresses</font>

43
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,039
lots of different sizes is there a

44
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:03,159
different palette / sighs uh you know

45
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,659
what that's a very good question and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

46
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:08,410
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the person to answer my guess is yes</font>

47
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:12,280
and it hands you the palette do you say

48
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,600
thank you or anything where did you just

49
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,600
go away no they take breaks they just

50
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,730
move and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting to</font>

51
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,400
watch because they never bump into each

52
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,959
other because they can sense when

53
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:23,569
they're close to

54
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:26,959
another one and it is programmed so that

55
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,560
the item that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is needed first gets the</font>

56
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,469
right of way and you watch these things

57
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:35,480
they move it's like a dance and if you

58
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,980
were in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> where they smash into you</font>

59
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,510
or they sent you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to well you're not</font>

60
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,430
allowed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move into that is just the</font>

61
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,269
keynote robot space robot space and so

62
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:46,159
how are they powered gifted plug them in

63
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:48,769
at night charge them<font color="#CCCCCC"> up again good</font>

64
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:52,700
question how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they cost a lot</font>

65
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,950
they do yeah yeah yeah like what is a

66
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,049
great company<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually Zappos uses them</font>

67
00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:01,310
to and you should get them on I'm sure

68
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,219
they'd be happy to explain so they ever

69
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:05,840
blow it and bring you the wrong stuff

70
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,730
and what do you do if that happens it it

71
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:12,230
it is so<font color="#CCCCCC"> rare for there to be an error</font>

72
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,719
with the robots humans are much more

73
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,849
prone to error right so somebody puts

74
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:18,199
the wrong bar code on it brings to the

75
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,669
wrong stack so you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got the robot</font>

76
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:21,349
sitting there no it's the wrong stuff

77
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:23,449
did you have a conversation with it say

78
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:25,549
even try the one next door you<font color="#CCCCCC"> send</font>

79
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:27,409
somebody in to the racetrack where

80
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:29,989
they're all its I I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

81
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:32,900
it's ever happened to be honest so you

82
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,479
know as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as it's it's received</font>

83
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,489
correctly you don't have a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>
