1
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:02,668
WEEK YOU, SHANNON.

2
00:00:02,668 --> 00:00:04,303
>> Shannon: 'S THANK YOU VERY

3
00:00:04,303 --> 00:00:04,837
MUCH FOR THE UPDATE.

4
00:00:04,837 --> 00:00:07,740
IN YET ANOTHER SIGN OF THE

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,141
TURNED OUT THIS CONFIRMATION IS

6
00:00:09,141 --> 00:00:10,743
BATTLE IS TAKING, JUDGE

7
00:00:10,743 --> 00:00:11,978
KAVANAUGH HAS WITHDRAWN FROM

8
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:14,013
TEACHING AT HARVARD LAW THIS

9
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:16,949
WINTER AS SIGNATURES ARE

10
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:18,351
GATHERED OBJECTING TO HIM AT THE

11
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,352
UNIVERSITY.

12
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,220
THEY SAY THAT IT SHOULD MAKE

13
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,155
EVERY AMERICAN THINK ABOUT THE

14
00:00:23,155 --> 00:00:24,524
LONG-TERM IMPACT ON THE

15
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,725
FOUNDATIONS OF OUR COUNTRY.

16
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:27,293
AND AN OP-ED PIECE, HE WRITES

17
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:35,268
"WE NOW LIVE IN AN AGE OF SEXUAL

18
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,169
McCARTHYISM.

19
00:00:37,169 --> 00:00:38,638
EVERY PERSON REGARDLESS OF HIS

20
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:39,939
STATUS THE KIND OF FUNDAMENTAL

21
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:42,342
FAIRNESS WE WOULD EXPECT FOR

22
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:43,710
OURSELVES IF WE WERE ACCUSED."

23
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,145
NEW TOURNAMENT.

24
00:00:46,145 --> 00:00:48,915
SEXUAL McCARTHYISM.

25
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:50,616
MOLLIE HEMINGWAY AND A

26
00:00:50,616 --> 00:00:52,518
GEORGETOWN CENTER.

27
00:00:52,518 --> 00:00:54,621
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.

28
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:57,290
AND ALL OF YOU TONIGHT.

29
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,925
I WANT TO START WITH SOMETHING

30
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:00,693
THAT THE TOP DEMOCRATS IN THE

31
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:02,328
SENATE, CHUCK SCHUMER, HAD TO

32
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,464
SAY ABOUT THIS PROCESS AND WHAT

33
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:04,864
IT'S ABOUT.

34
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:06,933
>> DEMOCRATS ARE NOT INTERESTED

35
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,134
IN DELAYING FOR THE SAKE OF

36
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:09,302
DELAY.

37
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:10,270
THIS CANNOT BE COMPLETED

38
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:10,703
QUICKLY.

39
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:13,139
BUT IT MUST BE DONE RIGHT.

40
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:14,541
>> Shannon: MOLLY, WHO DEFINES

41
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,843
HOW IT IS DONE RIGHT, OR THAT IT

42
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:19,512
HAS BEEN DONE RIGHT?

43
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:21,915
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, DEMOCRATS

44
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,283
DURING THE HEARING SAID THAT

45
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:24,951
THEY WOULD LIKE AN FBI

46
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:27,120
INVESTIGATION, AND THEY HAVE

47
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,887
GOTTEN THAT FBI INVESTIGATION.

48
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:29,189
AS SOON AS THEY GOT IT, WE

49
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,191
STARTED HEARING THAT THEY HAD

50
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,725
MORE THINGS THAT THEY NEEDED TO

51
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:33,326
BE SPECIFIC.

52
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:34,494
THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A HISTORY OF

53
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:35,929
DOING THINGS LIKE THIS, THEY

54
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,297
KNOW HOW TO DO INVESTIGATIONS

55
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,031
LIKE THIS.

56
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,066
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE

57
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,501
ANTHONY WEINER LAPTOP, THEY TOOK

58
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:44,704
CARE OF THAT IN JUST A FEW DAYS.

59
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,106
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST CLARENCE

60
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:46,806
THOMAS, THAT ALSO TOOK JUST A

61
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:48,508
FEW DAYS.

62
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,543
DO WE KNOW WHO ALL OF THE

63
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:51,010
WITNESSES ARE?

64
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,812
WE KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY,

65
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:53,880
WHAT QUESTIONS TO ASK.

66
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,048
IT IS A GOOD THING TO BE DONE.

67
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,284
I THINK IT WILL QUELL A LOT OF

68
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:58,885
CONCERN ABOUT THIS.

69
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,321
IF THERE IS ANY EVIDENCE, ANY

70
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,122
EVIDENCE AT ALL WHATSOEVER TO

71
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,891
SUPPORT THESE INCREASINGLY

72
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:10,497
RIDICULOUS ALLEGATIONS, IT WILL

73
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:11,531
CONFIRM OR DENY IT.

74
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,300
>> Shannon: THIS IS WHAT MITCH

75
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,501
McCONNELL HAD TO SAY.

76
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:17,504
THE GOALPOST IS SHIFTING.

77
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,506
BUT THE GOAL HASN'T MOVED AN

78
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:23,410
INCH.

79
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:29,283
WE WILL BE VOTING THIS WEEK.

80
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:29,916
>> Shannon: WHAT IS YOUR

81
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,518
OBJECTION?

82
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:34,888
>> I AM NOT OBJECTING THAT MITCH

83
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,523
McCONNELL IS OBJECTING TO

84
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:37,291
THIS.

85
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,925
OKAY, HYPOTHETICALLY, IF IT

86
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:40,294
DOES, IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO

87
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:41,828
ASSESS ON THE BASIS OF FBI

88
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,297
RECORD AS WELL AS THE TOTALITY

89
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:44,731
OF THE RECORD OF JUDGE

90
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:45,566
KAVANAUGH'S TESTIMONY AND HIS

91
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:46,466
JUDICIAL RECORD, AND THEY ARE

92
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:47,935
GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A

93
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:48,302
DECISION.

94
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:49,937
WE WILL SEE THEN THAT HE WON'T

95
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:51,305
BE CONFIRMED.

96
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:52,072
I AM NOT PERSUADED --

97
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:53,574
>> Shannon: YOU DON'T THINK HE

98
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:56,944
IS TO MAKE IT.

99
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:58,545
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN ASKING THIS

100
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,914
WHOLE TIME, WE NEED THE FBI

101
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:01,815
INVESTIGATION, IT ONLY TOOK

102
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:03,116
THREE DAYS FOR ANITA HILL.

103
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,885
WHY IS THIS ONE NOT GOOD ENOUGH

104
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:05,519
FOR YOU?

105
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,486
>> THIS IS WHAT I AM NOT

106
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:09,556
SURPRISED BY.

107
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,525
THE LATEST POLL NOW PUTS 40% OF

108
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,361
AMERICANS WHO ARE OPPOSED TO

109
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,529
THIS, 50% ARE WOMEN, BY THE WAY

110
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,296
IF YOU'RE IN MITCH McCONNELL

111
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:19,299
IS LOOKING AT THIS, THIS IS ALL

112
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,201
A POLITICAL MOVE FOR HIM.

113
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,569
TO FAST-TRACK THIS THING.

114
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,805
JEFF FLAKE CAME OUT AND SAID

115
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:25,138
TODAY --

116
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,039
>> Shannon: IF THE FBI

117
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,374
INVESTIGATION IS DONE, WHAT IS

118
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,342
YOUR OBJECTION?

119
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:30,077
>> I THINK THAT THEY WILL THEN

120
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,478
HAVE TO ASSESS ON THE BASIS OF

121
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:31,912
THE STRUCTURE.

122
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:33,447
I THINK THERE ARE ENOUGH PEOPLE

123
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:38,285
WHO HAVE OBJECTIONS, THAT HE HAS

124
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:38,952
A VERY DANGEROUS JUDICIAL

125
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,688
PHILOSOPHY, AS WELL AS CONCERNS

126
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:42,523
ABOUT HIS TEMPERAMENT.

127
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:44,324
>> Shannon: YOU THINK THIS IS

128
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,058
ABOUT MORE THAN JUST JUDGE

129
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:49,997
KAVANAUGH, THE MAN.

130
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:53,567
>> THIS IS ABOUT STOPPING A

131
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,568
CONSERVATIVE FROM MAKING IT ONTO

132
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,302
THE COURT.

133
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:57,104
THIS WOULD BE ABOUT STOPPING THE

134
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:57,838
NEXT ONE THAT WAS NOMINATED IN

135
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:00,674
HIS PLACE.

136
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:01,442
AND, WORST-CASE SCENARIO, IF HE

137
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:03,143
MAKES IT ON THE COURT, THIS IS

138
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:05,312
ABOUT DELEGITIMIZING THE

139
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:08,282
SUPREME COURT, A FIVE VOTE

140
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:09,516
SUPREME COURT.

141
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:10,417
THIS IS ABOUT DELEGITIMIZING OUR

142
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,718
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT,

143
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:12,719
SOMETHING THAT WE WERE TOLD IN

144
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,721
THE PAST WE SHOULD NOT BE DOING,

145
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,991
BUT THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

146
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:18,959
IF KAVANAUGH SHOULD GO ON THE

147
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,327
COURT, THEY WANT ANY RULINGS

148
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:21,728
THAT COME FROM THE COURT TO BE

149
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:22,129
DAMAGED.

150
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,898
>> Shannon: DO YOU THINK WE

151
00:04:23,898 --> 00:04:24,999
ARE STILL ALONG THE SAME VEIN OF

152
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:28,903
THE PRESIDENT DID NOT ELECTED,

153
00:04:28,903 --> 00:04:30,537
THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE HAS TO BE

154
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:31,105
REPEALED.

155
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,506
THEY QUESTION THE VERY

156
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:33,507
LEGITIMACY OF HIM, WHETHER HE

157
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,976
WAS HELPED BY RUSSIA, SO THAT IT

158
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,445
BRINGS INTO QUESTION ANYTHING

159
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:37,912
THAT HE DECIDES.

160
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:38,979
>> WE ARE GOING FROM ONE

161
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:42,116
INSTITUTION AFTER ANOTHER.

162
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:43,117
ONE OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL

163
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:44,352
INSTITUTIONS AFTER ANOTHER AND

164
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:45,720
IT DELEGITIMIZING THEM WHEN THEY

165
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,722
GET IN THE WAY OF THE OTHER

166
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:48,022
SIDE.

167
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:49,256
>> I THINK THIS IS ABOUT EVEN

168
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,125
MORE THAN THAT.

169
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,860
THIS IS A QUALIFIED JUDGE WHO

170
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,895
HAS HAD HIS NAME AND REPUTATION

171
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:55,796
AND HONOR COMPLETELY DRAGGED

172
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:56,530
THROUGH THE MUD.

173
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,232
IN THIS COUNTRY, WE TENDED TO

174
00:04:58,232 --> 00:05:00,134
HAVE A BELIEF THAT PEOPLE ARE

175
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:01,002
INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY.

176
00:05:01,002 --> 00:05:02,703
WE HAVE A RESPECT FOR DUE

177
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:03,204
PROCESS.

178
00:05:03,204 --> 00:05:05,206
PEOPLE SHOULD NOT HAVE THEIR

179
00:05:05,206 --> 00:05:06,374
LIVES DESTROYED THROUGH

180
00:05:06,374 --> 00:05:07,308
ALLEGATIONS.

181
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:08,509
YOU ARE SEEING A LOT OF OTHER

182
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:09,276
INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE MEDIA JUST

183
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:10,644
THROW THAT AWAY AND SAY THAT

184
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:14,115
THAT IS NOT IMPORTANT.

185
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:15,616
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS

186
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:17,652
ALL AMERICANS, LEFT OR RIGHT.

187
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:20,121
>> YOU WANT TO DETER ANY FUTURE

188
00:05:20,121 --> 00:05:21,889
PEOPLE, FOR FEAR THAT THEY ARE

189
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:22,590
GOING TO UNDERGO WHAT BRETT

190
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,225
KAVANAUGH HAS GONE THROUGH.

191
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:25,426
>> Shannon: DO YOU THINK

192
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:28,329
PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT THAT?

193
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:29,063
HE STARTS TAKING NOMINATIONS TO

194
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:32,066
THE SUPREME COURT.

195
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:33,701
DO YOU THINK THAT FOLKS ON BOTH

196
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:34,669
SIDES OF THE AISLE SHOULD BE

197
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:35,003
WORRIED?

198
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:36,437
>> I THINK THAT WHEN

199
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:41,342
MAYOR GARLAND IS DENIED EVEN A

200
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:42,577
SINGLE MEETING, WE LOOKED AT

201
00:05:42,577 --> 00:05:44,679
THAT AND SAID WHAT THE HECK IS

202
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:45,713
HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON?

203
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:48,883
WE ARE STILL VERY DISMAYED BY

204
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:49,984
THE PROFOUND POLITICAL CYNICISM.

205
00:05:49,984 --> 00:05:53,488
I DO THINK THAT IS A VERY

206
00:05:53,488 --> 00:05:54,022
LEGITIMATE CONCERN.

207
00:05:54,022 --> 00:05:55,823
THIS IS A PHENOMENAL CONSPIRACY.

208
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:59,460
BUT LET'S KEEP IN MIND THAT

209
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,730
PROFESSOR FORD CAME FORWARD AND

210
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,333
OFFERED UP HER CONCERNS AND THE

211
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,034
LETTER BEFORE BRETT KAVANAUGH

212
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:07,902
WAS NOMINATED TO THE

213
00:06:07,902 --> 00:06:09,671
SUPREME COURT.

214
00:06:09,671 --> 00:06:10,338
>> Shannon: DIANNE FEINSTEIN

215
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:11,906
HELD THE LETTER.

216
00:06:11,906 --> 00:06:14,109
>> WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS HIDDEN,

217
00:06:14,109 --> 00:06:15,210
AS TO SUPPOSE THAT THIS WAS SOME

218
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,946
SORT OF PREMEDITATED CONSPIRACY

219
00:06:17,946 --> 00:06:19,647
ON HER PART IS JUST LAUGHABLE.

220
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,649
>> YOU NEED TO HAVE EVIDENCE

221
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:24,486
INSTEAD OF JUST STORIES.

222
00:06:24,486 --> 00:06:25,720
SINCE YOU BROUGHT UP

223
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,488
MERRICK GARLAND, I THINK THAT IS

224
00:06:26,488 --> 00:06:27,122
A REASONABLE THING TO BE

225
00:06:27,122 --> 00:06:29,324
CONCERNED ABOUT.

226
00:06:29,324 --> 00:06:31,092
THANK A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T

227
00:06:31,092 --> 00:06:31,926
DRAG HIS NAME THROUGH THE MUD OR

228
00:06:31,926 --> 00:06:38,066
ACCUSE HIM OF BEING RAPIST >>

229
00:06:38,066 --> 00:06:40,802
ABSOLUTELY, I WOULD HATE TO SEE

230
00:06:40,802 --> 00:06:42,670
ANYONE HAVE AN ALLEGATION LIKE

231
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,539
THAT, I AM VERY GLAD, AND I

232
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:45,407
THINK MOST REASONABLE PEOPLE

233
00:06:45,407 --> 00:06:47,876
HAVE BEEN CALLING FOR THIS, THAT

234
00:06:47,876 --> 00:06:49,310
WE HAVE AN FBI INVESTIGATION

235
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,812
THAT CAN HELP BUILD A FACTUAL

236
00:06:50,812 --> 00:06:51,146
RECORD.

237
00:06:51,146 --> 00:06:54,916
>> Shannon: SO WHAT DO YOU TO

238
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:55,183
SAY?

239
00:06:55,183 --> 00:06:57,319
>> A VOTE AT THE END OF THE WEEK

240
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,286
IT, AND IT SHOULD GO FOR

241
00:06:58,286 --> 00:06:58,687
KAVANAUGH.

242
00:06:58,687 --> 00:07:01,356
>> I AGREE WITH THAT, AND THE

243
00:07:01,356 --> 00:07:03,325
FBI INVESTIGATION, SUCH AS IT

244
00:07:03,325 --> 00:07:04,526
IS, WILL BE TRASHED.

245
00:07:04,526 --> 00:07:05,927
>> Shannon: I HAVE A FEELING

246
00:07:05,927 --> 00:07:07,462
THAT WHOEVER FAVORS OR DOESN'T

247
00:07:07,462 --> 00:07:09,331
FAVOR, I THINK THAT THERE WILL

248
00:07:09,331 --> 00:07:10,565
BE PEOPLE WHO ARE UNHAPPY WITH

249
00:07:10,565 --> 00:00:00,000
IT.
