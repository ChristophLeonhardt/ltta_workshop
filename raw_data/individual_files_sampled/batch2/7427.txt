fresh off of his successful campaign to fourth force Jeff Bezos in Amazon to treat their workers with at least some sort of minimal economic dignity although there are still concerns don't take your eye off the prize there in terms of bonuses and things like that but overall bill freelance workers freelance workers yes but overall good news yeah and that's because he and ro Cana and others were pushing for it with a couple of bills although they were condescended to and much derided after they put that forward he's now got the sequel and that is a plan to break up the big banks and avoid another horrific economic recession so he's got a bill it would borrow financial institutions from holding assets derivatives and other forms of borrowing worth more than 3% of the entire US economy that puts it at a potential cap of 584 billion dollars in today's dollars now it seems like what bank even could possibly be worth that much of the banking sector which by the way like we're gonna break it down but that is Bernie being really generous there yeah yeah you could still be like you can be a Luxembourg in size and we'll be okay with it so there are some that would qualify so JPMorgan Bank of America Citigroup Wells Fargo Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley as well as insurance giants like Prudential Financial and MetLife all of them are bigger than that collectively hold more than thirteen dollars and assets and that is worrying to people who have lived through the recession lived through too-big-to-fail saw the bailout that we did and when you realize that all of those banks are way way bigger than they were back then and he would like to cap that so what'd you think of his plan well Bernie understands one thing very well and that is that politics is effective when it channel's people's anger towards an enemy right in the Republicans what they do is they sense accurately sense people's anger and then channel it towards immigrants and Muslims and you know pointy-headed liberal professors players yeah exactly Bernie what he's doing is is channeling people's anger toward the we should be angry yeah and this is like a this is what a big difference between him and most other Democrats is that most other Democrats can't do that because they're all funded by the donor class so they can't really go after you know the the big banks are the big Silicon Valley firms already or anything like that because they've taken a lot of money from them Bernie because he doesn't is allowed to do that which is another reason why they hate him so much they fear him so much but that's that's that's that's what this is all about I mean the details of the policy are you know whatever we can talk about him but the really important thing is pointing people's attention toward the people who they should be paying attention to the battle here is and is it has always been truly the battle of the haves and have-nots yeah and we get so distracted by other things because the great distractors keep us divided and divide and conquer is real but one thing that I want to say is when Bernie did what he did and the Amazon deal went down I saw a lot of people tweeting about that how much that money fit that that minimum wage is still below the poverty line and all this stuff and and what I want to say is take this moment to say we take so much time to be cynical we're always negative and pessimistic now all of us but many of us when we have a victory we don't know how to you know assess and and just have a victory if I feel the way I feel about it and regardless of that I watch the video of the actual employees who were celebrating inspiring yeah and I was inspired by the fact that they were happy for their victory and those of us who use our snark and are so smug and are always like well that's not this what are you doing like what are you doing to make a difference because bernie is not in office and he's out there marching for the people and still trying to make a change for the people so inform yourselves and and you know what I mean I believe that the movement needs a little bit of optimism we can't cuz we're we can't just live in this negativity all the time so you know what I salute Bernie and finally somebody's aiming the gun at the real enemy instead of us aiming it at each other yeah and look at there certainly are areas where 15 isn't in but I got news for you when you start when you launch fight for 25 you know who's gonna show up to your rallies Bernie fight for 15 people and also Bernie Sanders by the way yeah and by the way when you get them to raise the minimum wage to 15 it gets people used to the idea that oh maybe the minimum wage should go up every couple of decades yeah which is great and like so California did a bill recently where it was just a couple days ago they signed a bill where corporate boards have to have at least one woman on them yeah okay well we're all this is what you think of that if this starts to get people to rethink the the constitution of corporate boards maybe we can make other changes maybe a representative of the workers could end up on there and people get used to this sort of thing and so Bernie did it with Amazon he did it with Disney by the waiting for them to finally get away he was he was the candidate in 2016 that was pie in the sky didn't understand how things worked could never actually deliver but here he is delivering for people generally like with Disney they're not in his state by the way yeah they're not his constituents but he's still doing it so he had this to say about his bill we spent huge amounts of money bailing them out the banks and they're significantly larger now than they were back then it's time we returned to that discussion especially now for the 10th anniversary of the crash by the way congratulations us on not having the double-dip recession in the first decade that is actually good news ever since the the banking deregulation of the 80s we had the crash in 89 we had the dot-com crash in 99 2000 we had the 2008 crash we're kind of due for another crash yeah this would be the bird crash of 2019 or something that's true but I want to be fair and give a counterpoint so the financial services forum this is a DC based lobbying firm represents large financial services company said to address so-called too big to fail banks risks ignoring the role these banks play in supporting the global economy this comes to you by the group that represents Bank of America City JP Morgan Goldman Sachs okay well they're gonna be a little bit biased there and I understand that it's likely that in the wake of this bill just like with the stop business Act they're gonna be people saying it's unrealistic it's not exactly the fix we need maybe we should change the cap slightly up or slightly down or whatever look he's getting people to focus on this and put pressure on them we had a row Cana on my show to break it down and at that point there was he wasn't even super optimistic that it would work but he thought that it was important to push the conversation in that direction and Jeff Bezos caves within like 48 hours of that interview we need more of this this is why you need not just a person who hypothetically shares an ideology with you but is an advocate for the positions that you care about actually is willing to fight and as Nando pointed out it is amazing what can be accomplished when you are freed up from these donors when you are free to pick and choose who to attack not based on a can I get away with this but what is right what is wrong yeah and then the other thing the other thing that Bernie does well and he understands well and like which was you know when he was described as sort of like naive or pie-in-the-sky or whatever he understands that the only way progressive legislation happens is if there is sort of a mass movement of people behind it and actively so that's why he activated or he helped to activate all these you know hundreds of thousands of Amazon workers not just the United States but all over the world and he understood that unless they kind of pushed for this along with him in Congress nothing was ever gonna happen you know like I think often like liberals and like the way politics is covered on cable news is that like politics like this game of like you know west wing style and discussion yeah and really what it is especially on the progressive side is it neat it requires a mass movement of people to put a ton of pressure pointed in the particular direction that it needs to be at the right moment and that's like that's how I did it with Disney that's how he did it with that's how the fight for 15/1 has done it all over the place
