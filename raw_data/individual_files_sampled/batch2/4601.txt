welcome back as we've been saying tensions are building in the Senate ahead of Thursday's hearing with Brett Kavanaugh and one of his accusers sent a Republican leader Mitch McConnell echoed judge Kavanaugh s claim that the accusations are quote a smear campaign as he wrote in his own letter to chairman Grassley yesterday the weaponization the weaponization of unsubstantiated smears that's what we have here the weaponization of unsubstantiated smears will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from service well the Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer fired back at that leader McConnell owes an apology to dr. Ford for labeling her allegations a smear job joined now by Illinois Democratic senator dick durbin he's a member of the Judiciary Committee and of course the number two member in the Democratic leadership in the Senate Senator Durbin good to see you good to be with you chuck well I know you have heard the news that the Senate Republicans on the Judiciary Committee have hired outside counsel it's my understanding you haven't they that you have not been informed or hadn't been informed as of a couple of hours ago have you been informed since no and we're still waiting this mystery guest is going to appear on Thursday I hope that we learn who it is ahead of time do you think Democrats on the Judiciary Committee on a point one person to ask why it's going to be I had a guest previously you said you know maybe it'll it'll make a more coherent round of questioning anyway how did the Democrats plan to handle this listen Chuck I spent a long time running for the Senate and hoping to be on the Senate Judiciary Committee to serve on that committee at historic moments like this it wasn't to delegate this authority to some lawyer at this point I think our committee is prepared to do this in a professional way we're going to treat both witnesses with respect we're going to try to establish the facts as best we can and then come to a conclusion about whether or not the Brit Cavanaugh should be given his promotion to a lifetime appointment on the highest court of the land what would be what how are you going to decide the credibility of the accusation in the denial what what are you looking for because it's a what beyond we don't have we're not gonna have the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt I think everybody understands that so what are you looking for well you look for the testimony of the people under oath they understand the seriousness of this as far as dr. Ford is concerned I've always thought she has everything to lose and nothing to gain by stepping forward and telling this story look what she's been through she's been ridiculed by the President of the United States she said her family moved out of their home because of death threats she's faced all sorts of charges many of them completely false and she had to know that going in and what yet she felt it was important enough to tell the American people her experience and to share them that says a lot about her credibility as far as Mitch Cavanaugh is concerned he's completely denied that anything happened we'll wait and hear his testimony under oath you know in her letter to Senator Grassley dr. Ford indicated she was trying to get this on the radar of official Washington before Judge Cavanaugh was actually nominated this system in that sense didn't work in time why well I'm not sure the system is really prepared for what we are now facing the me2 movement and the disclosures that are coming forward are fairly unique in American political history you have to go in 27 years on the Supreme Court to the Anita Hill episode which my let me toss you there sure is it unique or shouldn't that have been after that episode the time that the United States Senate said you know what we got to figure out how to deal with allegations like this I don't question what you just said I think we could have done a better job over the years but you know in all honesty look at every aspect of our public life whether we're talking about business or religion or politics this is all emerging constantly emerging we're learning day to day that their effects in the history of this country and the history of individuals which no one had an idea Kelly and Conway the other day said something interesting she said you know if you take the accusations at face value one thing that is different about judge Cavanaugh and these acute in the accusations against him versus the me to movement is that he didn't do this when he had power and I guess the question is this when should actions in high school in college matter thirty years later in wins shouldn't they or should they always like what is that test now Chuck it's a this is different than the usual situation of complaints about a person seeking a higher position or higher office I've really stepped back here we've had that the people the tribes the political tribes break either favoring Cavanaugh or opposed to Cavanaugh but what I've been struck by and speaking to my own staff and my friends and people people are more open telling me things about themselves than they've ever told anyone we're at a point in life where we are looking at things from a new perspective and people are finally summoning the courage to step up and say things which are hard as heck to say and they just believe they have to be said so this is a new moment a new generation of thinking it's the right thing to finally come to grips with this challenge would you open an investigation into a justice Cavanaugh if he sort of if he ends up getting confirmed if if we sort of feel if you feel as if this was a political push you know after Thursday everybody got into their corners it's a partisan confirmation 50/50 with pence or 5149 would you open at reopen the inquiry if Democrats took back the Senate let me tell you at this point I'm not at that stage you're a couple steps ahead of the reality of what we face a hearing with dr. Ford as well as Judge Cavanaugh then the committee meeting then the floor consideration then the final vote several stages ahead and each of these witnesses who will appear before us on Thursday we'll be under oath to tell the truth I hope that they do and in telling the truth I hope we can come to a better conclusion as a Senate Judiciary Committee in terms of future investigations and future inquiries I don't want to go there well let me ask you one other future question and that is if Democrats win the Senate are you opening to bring him open to bringing back the filibuster because a lot of us believe if the filibuster if it were a 60-vote threshold this would just be a different process it's interesting a Republican senator this morning in the gym raised the same question with me and I said I think we're learning our lesson here that eliminating the filibuster on the Supreme Court at least and maybe the other federal court positions has really created a much more political process it is better for us to move towards something that's bipartisan and try to find more moderate people to serve on our federal judiciary senator dick durbin Democrat from Illinois thank you sir always appreciate you coming on sharing your views thanks Joe hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our channel so thank you now do me a favor subscribe by clicking on that button down there click on any of the videos to watch the latest interviews and highlights from MTV daily and MSNBC you get more Meet the Press content every morning and the first read newsletter if you're tired of content that you don't know anything about where it came from you don't have to have that problem with us NBC News MSNBC MTP and the Meet the Press mindset right here for you on youtube subscribe now
