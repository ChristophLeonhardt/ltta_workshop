APPLIED FOR LOANS TO HELP 
SUPPLEMENT HIS INCOME, BUT 
PROVIDED FALSE INFORMATION TO 
THE BANKS. 
SO FAR THE EIGHT COUNTS THAT 
THE JURY COULD ACTUALLY COME TO 
A DECISION ON ARE ALL GUILTY. 
THESE ARE THE FIRST CONVICTIONS 
SECURED BY SPECIAL COUNSEL, 
ROBERT MUELLER. 
>> SO, THE 10 COUNTS THAT AT 
THIS POINT, THAT THEY CANNOT 
COME TO A DECISION ON -- AGAIN, 
IT APPEARS THE JUDGE IS 
PROCEEDING -- I'M GOING TO LET 
THEM PROCEED WITH HIS PARTIAL 
VERDICT. 
THESE 10 COUNTS WOULD MOSTLY 
APPLY TO THE LOANS THAT THE 
PROSECUTOR HAD ISSUE WITH HOW 
THEY WERE SECURED? 
>> EXACTLY. 
I EVEN COVERED THIS CASE OVER 
THE PAST FEW WEEKS. 
THIS IS NOT A SURPRISE. 
THE STRONGEST CASE FOR THE 
PROSECUTION WAS THE TAX FRAUD. 
THAT IS IN MANY WAYS A 
PAPERWORK CRIME. 
IT WAS SUPPORTED BY A 
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PAPER 
EVIDENCE, SUPPORTED BY DOZENS 
OF WITNESSES THAT THE JURY 
HEARD FROM. 
BUT, WE SAW THE QUESTIONS THAT 
THE JURY SUBMITTED LAST 
THURSDAY, SUGGESTING THEY HAD 
CONCERNS ABOUT HIS FAILURE TO 
DISCLOSE THIRD -- CERTAIN 
FOREIGN BANK ACCOUNTS, AND 
WHETHER HE REALLY DID 
INTENTIONALLY FAILED TO 
DISCLOSE THEM, OR WHETHER THEY 
BELIEVE THE DEFENSE'S THEORY, 
WHICH IS THAT HE FARMED THIS 
OUT TO OTHER PEOPLE, INCLUDING 
HIS BUSINESS ASSOCIATE, RICHARD 
GATES. 
IT APPEARS THAT THE JURY 
BELIEVES THERE WAS REASONABLE 
DOUBT ABOUT THOSE CHARGES. 
WHEN IT COMES TO THE FACT THAT 
HE APPLIED FOR LOANS IN THE -- 
PROVIDED FALSE INFORMATION. 
EACH OF THESE LOANS WAS A 
DIFFERENT SET OF FACTS. 
IT APPEARS THAT SOME PEOPLE 
COULD BELIEVE THERE WAS IN FACT 
REASONABLE DOUBT ABOUT WHETHER 
OR NOT HE COMMITTED BRING -- 
BANK FRAUD FOR THOSE LOANS. 
SO, THIS VERDICT IS NOT A HUGE 
SURPRISE, HAVING BEEN IN THE 
COURTROOM OVER THE PAST FEW 
WEEKS. 
>> PAULA, OKAY -- SO, IF YOU 
ARE ROBERT MUELLER RIGHT NOW, 
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING BASED ON 
WHAT YOU ARE SEEING? 
ALSO, IF YOU ARE PRESIDENT 
TRUMP ? 
>> IF YOU ARE ROBERT MUELLER, I 
THINK THAT HE WOULD SAY -- YOU 
KNOW WHAT? 
I WILL TAKE IT. 
THE COUNTS THAT WE ALL GOT WERE 
GUILTY. 
THERE IS ANOTHER TRIAL COMING 
UP FOR MR. MANAFORT IN DECEMBER 
ON SIMILAR CHARGES. 
THIS WILL FOCUS MORE ON THE 
KIND OF WORK THAT HE WAS DOING, 
ON HIS LOBBYING WORK. 
THAT HE FAILED TO DISCLOSE THAT 
HE WAS DOING IT ON BEHALF OF A 
PRO UKRAINIAN POLITICIAN. 
THIS IS MORE ABOUT HIS 
FINANCES, HIS INCOME, AND THE 
FACT THAT HE ALLEGEDLY FAILED 
TO DISCLOSE SOME OF IT. 
SO, HERE ROBERT MUELLER IS 
SAYING -- YOU KNOW WHAT, I WILL 
TAKE US. 
IF YOU ARE PRESIDENT TRUMP, YOU 
WILL SEIZE ON THE FACT THAT THE 
JURY COULD NOT COME TO  A 
CONSENSUS ON THE MAJORITY OF 
THESE COUNTS. 
IF YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT, YOU 
WILL . OUTÃƒPOINT OUT THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT SPOKE TO GATES 
SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND CHOSE NOT 
TO BRING CHARGES. 
HE WILL HAMMER ON THE FACT THAT 
THEY CANNOT COME TO A CONSENSUS 
AND CONTINUE TO PUSH THE 
ARGUMENT, THAT THIS IS A 
POLITICALLY MOTIVATED 
PROSECUTION. 
IT IS ALSO NOW UP TO PRESIDENT 
TRUMP  IF HE WANTS TO PARDON 
HIS FORMER CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN ON 
THESE CONVICTIONS. 
>> A DIVIDED COUNTRY, A DIVIDED 
VERDICT SO FAR. 
LET'S CHECK IN WITH MAJOR 
GARRETT, AT THE WHITE HOUSE 
WITH MORE ON ALL OF THIS.  
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, TELL US 
WHAT YOU MAKE OF WHAT YOU ARE 
SEEING HERE. 
>> WELL, THE WHITE HOUSE WILL 
SAY WHAT PAULA SAID, THAT ALL 
OF THESE CHARGES, THE 
CONVICTIONS, DEAL WITH 
FINANCIAL CRIMES. 
NOW, IF CONVICTED PAULA -- PAUL 
MANAFORT HAS BEEN -- IT HAD 
NOTHING TO DO WITH WORKING 
AROUND PRESIDENT TRUMP OR HIS 
CAMPAIGN. 
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS TRIED TO 
PUT AS MUCH DISTANCE AS 
POSSIBLE BETWEEN THESE LEGAL 
PROCEEDINGS  AND PAUL 
MANAFORT'S WORK AS GENERAL 
CHAIRMAN FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN 
AND A VITAL PART OF THAT 
CAMPAIGN FROM MAY-JULY, CRUCIAL 
TO SECURING AND THEN HOLDING 
ALL OF THE DELEGATES NECESSARY 
TO MAKE DONALD TRUMP THE 
REPUBLICAN NOMINEE. 
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS SAID IT IS 
UNFAIR TO TAR THE PRESIDENT 
WITH THESE FINANCIAL MISDEEDS 
OF PAUL MANAFORT THAT OCCURRED 
LONG BEFORE THAT POLITICAL 
ACTIVITY. 
AN UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH FOR THIS 
WHITE HOUSE -- PAUL MANAFORT 
IMPLICATED AND CONVICTED. 
AND NOW RICK GATES WHO WAS A 
WITNESS IN THIS TRIAL AND 
ADMITTED TO MISDEEDS, BOTH WERE 
CENTRAL FIGURES IN THE TRUMP 
CAMPAIGN. 
EVEN AFTER PAUL MANAFORT LEFT 
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, RICK GATES 
STAYED ON. 
ALL THROUGH THE FALL CAMPAIGN. 
THEN, HE WAS A SIGNIFICANT 
FUNDRAISER IN DECISION-MAKER 
WITHIN THE PRESIDENT'S 
INAUGURATION COMMITTEE. 
YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
ADMITTED TO WRONGDOING. ONE 
CONVICTED OF IT, PAUL MANAFORT, 
WHO DID HAVE SIGNIFICANT ROLES 
IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. 
TRY AS THE WHITE HOUSE HAS TO 
DISTANCE ITSELF FROM WHO PAUL 
MANAFORT IS, AND WHAT HE DID, 
AND WHAT HE IS ALLEGED TO HAVE 
DONE, AND NOW CONVICTED OF, 
THESE TWO STORIES DO CO-MINGLE. 
THE PRESIDENT IS FLYING TO WEST 
VIRGINIA. 
I GUARANTEE YOU HIS EYES ARE ON 
ANOTHER LEGAL MATTER IN NEW 
YORK -- MICHAEL COHEN ABOUT 
READY TO PLEA TO OTHER CHARGES 
THAT COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT 
REPERCUSSIONS  AND IMPLICATIONS 
FOR THE PRESIDENT, NOT JUST 
LEGALLY, BUT POLITICALLY. 
>> WE WILL TAKE A PICTURE OF 
THE COURTHOUSE IN NEW YORK WHERE
MICHAEL COHEN IS PLEADING 
GUILTY  ON THIS REMARKABLE 
LEGAL AFTERNOON WITH BOTH 
MICHAEL COHEN PLEADING GUILTY 
AND NOW PAUL MANAFORT, AT LEAST 
FOUND GUILTY ON SOME CHARGES, 
8/18  COUNTS IN HIS FRAUD 
TRIAL. 
YOU ARE LOOKING AT LOWER 
MANHATTAN HERE RIGHT NOW. 
THIS WAS A CASE THAT WAS 
REFERRED TO THE SOUTHERN 
DISTRICT OF NEW YORK BY ROBERT 
MUELLER'S TEAM. WE ARE WAITING 
TO GET MORE DETAILS ON EXACTLY 
WHAT THE CHARGES THAT MICHAEL 
COHEN IS PLEADING GUILTY TO --  
MAYBE WE CAN CIRCLE BACK TO 
PAULA REID  WHO IS IN VIRGINIA 
BUT HAS COVERED THE MICHAEL 
COHEN CASE EXTENSIVELY. 
PAULA, IF YOU ARE WITH US -- I 
KNOW THAT YOU ARE WAITING FOR A 
LOT OF INFORMATION HERE ON PAUL 
MANAFORT.  
WHAT IS YOUR GUIDE AND SO FAR 
ON MICHAEL COHEN IN THIS PLEA?  
>> Reporter: WE EXPECT THIS PLEA
DEAL WILL NOT REQUIRE ANY 
COOPERATION AGAINST THE 
PRESIDENT. 
HE IS NOT FLIPPING. 
THIS IS EXPECTED TO BE A 
STRAIGHT PLEA DEAL, THE KIND 
THAT YOU WOULD SEE WITH MANY 
DEFENDANTS GOING TO FEDERAL 
COURT. 
HE IS GOING TO PLEAD GUILTY TO 
SEVERAL CHARGES WHICH WE EXPECT 
WILL BE TAX FRAUD AND SOME 
CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATION, AND 
SOURCES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT WE 
WATCH CAREFULLY ON WHAT HE 
ADMITS TO IN CONNECTION WITH 
THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATION. 
AS YOU MAY REMEMBER, THE 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN 
INVESTIGATING MR. MICHAEL COHEN 
FOR POSSIBLE CAMPAIGN FINANCE 
VIOLATION  RELATED TO CERTAIN 
HUSH MONEY PAYMENTS THAT HE 
NEGOTIATED TO KEEP WOMEN QUIET 
ABOUT THEIR ALLEGED AFFAIRS 
WITH THE PRESIDENT. 
SO, THIS WILL NOT REQUIRE HIS 
COOPERATION AGAINST THE 
PRESIDENT OR ANYONE ELSE, BUT 
IT COULD BE SIGNIFICANT, 
DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFICS OF 
WHAT HE IS ADMITTING IN 
CONNECTION TO CAMPAIGN FINANCE 
VIOLATION. 
>> OKAY, SO AS YOU SAID, 
MICHAEL:NOT FLIPPING ON THE 
PRESIDENT, BUT THEN THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL COULD THEN USE THAT 
INFORMATION FROM THE MICHAEL 
COHEN PLEA?  
>> Reporter: HE COULD PROVIDE 
INFORMATION BETWEEN THE TIME 
THAT HE PLEASE TODAY, AND WHEN 
HE IS SENTENCED IN WEEKS OR 
MONTHS. 
THAT COULD HELP SENTENCING. 
BUT, SOURCES CLOSE TO THE 
INVESTIGATION TELL ME THAT 
MICHAEL COHEN IS CONSIDERED A 
PROBLEMATIC WITNESS. 
HE IS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE  A 
VIABLE SOURCE OF INFORMATION, 
BECAUSEEVEN IF HE WAS TO FLIP, 
IF THEY WERE TO MAKE IT TO 
TRIAL, AS YOU SEE HERE IN THE 
MANAFORT CASE, PUT HIM ON THE 
STAND, THERE ARE CONCERNS THAT 
HE COULD BE EASILY DISCREDITED 
OR UNDERMINED. 
HE IS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE A 
VALUABLE ASSET TO SPECIAL 
COUNSEL, BUT IF HE COMES UP 
WITH A PIECE OF PHYSICAL 
EVIDENCE OR SOME OTHER 
TESTIMONY THAT HE WANTS TO 
OFFER BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN HE 
IS SENTENCED, IT IS POSSIBLE. 
MUELLER COULD TAKE THAT 
COOPERATION IN EXCHANGE FOR A 
LIGHTER SENTENCE. 
BUT, AS OF RIGHT NOW, THAT IS 
NOT WHAT WE UNDERSTAND HE HAS 
AGREED TO DO. 
>> I'M JUST HEARING THAT WE ARE 
UNDERSTANDING NOW THAT MICHAEL 
COHEN HAS THE GUILTY PLEA AND 
IT INVOLVES A PRISON SENTENCE 
UP TO FIVE YEARS . FIVE YEARS 
AND THREE MONTHS. 
THAT SOUNDS SIGNIFICANT. 
WHAT ELSE THEN,  WHAT HAPPENS 
NEXT WITH MICHAEL COHEN?  
>> WELL, HE WILL NOT BE 
SENTENCED TODAY. 
THIS IS THE DEAL THAT HE HAS 
STRUCK BETWEEN THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT AND DEFENSE 
ATTORNEYS. 
THAT IS WHAT THEY WILL 
RECOMMEND TO A JUDGE, BUT A 
JUDGE CAN GO HARDER OR LIGHTER. 
IT ALSO DEPENDS ON HIS CONDUCT 
BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN HE IS 
SENTENCED. 
BUT, THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT DAY. 
YOU HAVE TO OF THE PRESIDENTS 
TOP ASSOCIATES IN FEDERAL 
COURT, ONE PLEADING GUILTY, 
ANOTHER ONE BEING CONVICTED ON 
8 COUNTS. 
>> SO, TELL ME -- MANAFORT 
CONVICTED ON 8/18 COUNTS, WHAT 
HAPPENS TO THE OTHER 10 THEN? 
>> HE COULD BE RETRIED, BECAUSE 
THIS WAS A MISTRIAL. 
BUT, HE HAS ANOTHER TRIAL IN 
SEPTEMBER. 
I WOULD EXPECT THAT THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL WILL WAIT AND SEE HOW 
THAT CASE GOES, AND THEN THEY 
WILL DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY 
WANT TO SPEND THE RESOURCES TO 
RETRY HIM ON THOSE OTHER 10 
COUNTS. 
>> OKAY. 
PAULA REID, THANK YOU FOR YOUR 
REPORTING ON BOTH STORIES, BACK 
TO MAJOR GARRETT.  
MAJOR, AS YOU SIFT THROUGH THIS 
LEGAL MAZE OF THIS AFTERNOON, 
NOW GETTING NEW INFORMATION ON 
MICHAEL COHEN,  AND HIS GUILTY 
PLEA, PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE 
FROM DC FOR US. 
>> AS PAULA SAID, WHAT DOES HE 
PLEAD TO? 
AND HOW SPECIFIC IS THIS CHARGE 
ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATION? 
IS IT ONLY RELATED TO ACTIONS 
MICHAEL COHEN TOOK THAT HAVE NO 
LARGER IMPLICATION FOR 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S KNOWLEDGE , 
EITHER AS A CANDIDATE OR 
PRESIDENT? 
OR, DOES IT SUGGEST THAT HE DID 
KNOW ABOUT IT? 
IF IT DOES, THAT WILL UNDERMINE 
THE PRESIDENTS SHARP DENIALS 
THAT HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT 
THIS, AND IT COULD PLACE HIM IN 
SOME FORM OF LEGAL JEOPARDY. 
THOSE I HAVE TALKED TO AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE ARE MUCH MORE 
AFRAID OF THE POLITICAL 
RAMIFICATIONS. 
IF MICHAEL:HE SAYS SOMETHING 
THAT SUGGESTS THE PRESIDENT HAS 
BEEN LESS THAN TRUTHFUL ABOUT 
THIS, THAT COULD DAMAGE HIM 
POLITICALLY MORE SO THAN 
LEGALLY. 
>> OKAY, MAJOR GARRETT, THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH. 
WE HAVE A FEW SLOW, UNFOLDING 
LEGAL DRAMAS THAT HAVE  BEEN 
PLAYING OUT FOR WEEKS OR MONTHS 
NOW, THEY BOTH SEEM TO COME TO 
A CONCLUSION WITHIN AN HOUR OF 
EACH OTHER, THAT IS PAUL 
MANAFORT BEING FOUND GUILTY ON 
8/18 CHARGES. THAT IS IN 
FEDERAL COURT IN ALEXANDRIA, 
VIRGINIA. 
THAT IS THE SCREEN ON YOUR 
RIGHT. 
ON THE LEFT, NEW YORK CITY AS 
MICHAEL COHEN NOW  PLEADS GUILTY
TO CHARGES THAT COULD PUT HIM 
IN PRISON FOR UP TO FIVE YEARS 
AND THREE MONTHS. 
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE MUCH MORE 
ON ALL OF THIS ON YOUR LOCAL 
NEWS ON THIS CBS STATION. 
ALSO ON CBSN  AND RIGHT HERE 
TONIGHT ON THE CBS EVENING 
NEWS.  
FOR THEN, JEFF GORE, CBS NEWS, 
NEW YORK.  
>>> FOUR NEWS, 24 HOURS A DAY, 
GO TO CBSNEWS.COM.  
â™ª â™ª 
>>> WE ARE GOING TO RECAP WHAT 
YOU JUST HEARD. PAUL MANAFORT 
HAS BEEN FOUND GUILTY ON 8/18 
COUNTS AGAINST HIM. 
THIS IS THE FIRST TRIAL VICTORY 
FOR THE ROBERT MUELLER 
INVESTIGATION. 
A JUDGE TO DECLARE A MISTRIAL 
ON 10 OF THE OTHER COUNTS. 
AGAIN, I WANT TO RECAP, 
MANAFORT WAS FOUND GUILTY ON 
ALL FIVE -- TWO OF THE NINE 
BANK FRAUD CHARGES, AND ONE OF 
THE FOUR CHARGES RELATED TO 
FAILING TO DISCLOSE FOREIGN 
BANK ACCOUNTS. 
JOINING ME NOW IS CBS NEWS 
LEGAL ANALYST,  RICKY KLEEMAN. 
THANK YOU FOR STICKING WITH US. 
THERE IS A LOT GOING ON RIGHT 
NOW. 
WE HAVE THE PAUL MANAFORT 
VERDICT, BUT WE HAVE ALSO HEARD 
AT THE SAME TIME THAT MICHAEL 
COHEN HAS PLEADED GUILTY TO A 
POSSIBLE PLEA BARGAIN  THAT 
INCLUDES A SENTENCE OF UP TO 
FIVE YEARS AND THREE MONTHS, 
THAT IS QUITE SIGNIFICANT, 
ISN'T IT? 
>> THERE IS NO QUESTION IT IS 
SIGNIFICANT. 
IN THE SCHEME OF THINGS YOU 
HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THEY COULD
HAVE DONE WITH MICHAEL COHEN 
WHAT THE PROSECUTION DID WITH 
PAUL MANAFORT,  WHICH IS TAKE 
EVERY SINGLE THING THAT THEY 
BELIEVE THAT MICHAEL COHEN HAS 
DONE WRONG,  AND STACK THEM. 
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR MORE 
THAN FIVE YEARS THREE MONTHS. 
WHILE I SAY THAT, I WOULD NOT 
LIKE TO DO ONE DAY IN JAIL, LET 
ALONE A STATE PRISON, LET ALONE 
FIVE YEARS AND THREE MONTHS, 
BUT THAT APPEARS TO BE THE 
CEILING THAT THE PROSECUTION 
HAS RECOMMENDED, FIVE YEARS 
THREE MONTHS. 
SO, IT IS REALLY UP TO MICHAEL 
COHEN.  
IS HE GOING TO TOUGH IT OUT AND 
DO THE FIVE YEARS THREE MONTHS 
MINUS TIME FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR? 
OR, IS HE GOING TO MAKE A 
DECISION TODAY, TOMORROW, OR 
PERHAPS EVEN WHEN HE IS IN 
PRISON OF JUST SAYING -- THIS 
LIFE IS NOT FOR ME, I THINK 
THAT I WILL COOPERATE FURTHER. 
IF I COOPERATE FURTHER, I GET 
SOME TIME OFF. 
>> SO, RICKY, AT RISK OF 
STATING THE OBVIOUS -- I WOULD 
LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT ROBERT 
MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION HAS 
BORNE SERIOUS FOR TODAY. 
I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO READ A 
STATEMENT OF US SENATOR MARK 
WARNER WHO SAYS THIS VERDICT 
MAKES IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT 
THE ROBERT MUELLER PROBE IS NOT 
A WITCHHUNT, IT IS A SERIOUS 
INVESTIGATION THAT IS ROOTING 
OUT CORRUPTION AND RUSSIAN 
INFLUENCE ON OUR POLITICAL 
SYSTEM. 
SO, RICKY, WILL TODAY'S VERDICT 
BE ENOUGH TO PUT TO BED THE 
CALLS OF THE INVESTIGATION 
BEING A WITCHHUNT? 
>> NO. 
I ASSUME THAT WE WILL HEAR FROM 
DONALD TRUMP, VIA TWITTER, IT 
IS NOT -- IF NOT MOMENTARILY, 
CERTAINLY SOON. 
I THINK THAT WHAT YOU WILL FIND 
IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WILL 
SAY LOOK, IT IS ONE THING THAT 
HE WAS FOUND GUILTY OF TAX 
FRAUD COUNTS, THIS PRECEDED HIS 
TIME ON THE CAMPAIGN. 
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE 
CAMPAIGN, OR COLLUSION, OR 
RUSSIA, AND THAT THE RUSSIA 
COLLUSION INVESTIGATION REMAINS 
A WITCHHUNT. 
WE WILL HEA THAT, NO DOUBT 
FROM THE PRESIDENT. 
WE WILL ALSO HEAR IT FROM HIS 
SURROGATES. 
I'M SURE THAT THIS EVENING WE 
WILL HEAR IT ON FOX NEWS. 
SO, WHEN YOU GET A VERDICT OF 
8/18, YOU HAVE TO WINNERS INTO 
LOSERS IN THIS SITUATION, YOU 
HAVE THE GOVERNMENT SAYING -- 
LOOK, WE CONVICTED HIM OF EIGHT 
COUNTS, IT IS ALL THE TAX 
CRIMES, IT IS ALSO THE BANK 
FRAUD COUNT, AND WE ARE DEALING 
WITH THE FACT OF THE LOANS THAT 
STARTED TO APPROACH THE TIME 
THAT HE WAS ON THE CAMPAIGN. 
AND, THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL 
SAY -- WE WERE SUCCESSFUL, AND 
THEN YOU WILL HAVE THE 
ADMINISTRATION AND THEIR 
SURROGATES SAYING -- NO, LOOK 
AT WHAT HE WAS CONVICTED OF? 
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH 
RUSSIA. 
SO, BOTH SIDES ARE GOING TO 
CLAIM THEIR OWN KIND OF 
VICTORY. 
>> YOU KNOW, WE KNOW THAT PAUL 
MANAFORT AND THE DEFENSE HAVE 
AND COUNTING ON A PRESIDENTIAL 
PARDON. 
IS THAT LIKELY TO COME HERE? 
ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE 
EVIDENCE HERE AGAIN, YOU HAVE 
SEEN THE INDICTMENT, THE TAX 
FRAUD EVIDENCE IS PRETTY 
STRONG. 
WOULD IT SERVE THE PRESIDENT TO 
PARDON PAUL MANAFORT IN ANY WAY?
>> WELL, THE PRESIDENT MAY FEEL 
THAT HE WANTS TO WAIT FOR THE 
WASHINGTON TRIAL, AND AT THE 
END OF THE TWO TRIALS, IF THERE 
IS NO TIME LIMIT ON 
PRESIDENTIAL POWER OF PARDON, 
THAT THE PRESIDENT MAY DECIDE 
AT A LATER DATE THAT HE WANTS 
TO PARDON PAUL MANAFORT. 
HE HAS TO ALSO ASSUME THAT HE 
WILL HAVE TO PAY -- TAKE SOME 
POLITICAL FALLOUT AND PRAISE 
FOR THE DECISION. 
KEEP THIS IN MIND -- IF THERE 
IS TAX FRAUD ON THE FEDERAL 
LEVEL BY VIRTUE OF THAT, THERE 
WAS ALSO TAX FRAUD AT THE STATE 
LEVEL. 
SO, IF THE STATE WANTS TO GO 
AHEAD AND CHARGE THE TAX FRAUD, 
OR THE STATE WANTS TO GO AHEAD 
AND LOOK AT IF THERE ARE STATE 
CRIMES INVOLVING ANY OF THESE 
TYPES OF CRIMES THAT WOULD NOT 
BE DOUBLE JEOPARDY. 
THE STATE, WHETHER IT IS 
VIRGINIA OR NEW YORK, COULD GO 
FORWARD AND LOOK AT ITS OWN 
CRIME. 
IF THAT HAPPENS, THE PRESIDENT 
CANNOT PARDON STATE CRIMES. 
THUS FAR, NO STATE HAS CHOSEN 
TO GO FORWARD AND CHARGE PAUL 
MANAFORT WITH A CRIME. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS CERTAINLY 
MADE ENOUGH NOISE IN HIS RECENT 
COMMENTARY ABOUT PAUL MANAFORT 
BEING A GOOD GUY. 
THAT THIS WHOLE THING IS A 
WITCHHUNT. 
THAT, EVEN WHEN ASKED IF HE WAS 
GOING TO PARDON PAUL MANAFORT, 
HE HAD SAID WE WILL SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS. 
>> WRIGHT, BECAUSE HE IS ALSO 
-- THERE ARE TIMES WHEN HE HAS 
DISTANCED HIMSELF AS WELL. 
HE SAID ALL THIS HAPPENED WAY 
BEFORE HE WAS WORKING FOR ME. 
SO, THERE ARE TIMES WHEN HE 
SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT HE WAS 
WASHING HIS HANDS OF PAUL 
MANAFORT AS WELL. 
>> YES. 
IN FACT, HE HAS ALSO DONE BOTH 
SIDES WITHIN THE SAME 
COMMENTARY. 
ANY OF THESE THINGS HE IS 
CHARGED WITH WERE BEFORE THE 
CAMPAIGN. 
HE REALLY WAS NOT WORKING ON 
THE CAMPAIGN VERY LONG, I DID 
NOT KNOW HIM VERY WELL. 
AND THEN IN THE NEXT BREATH 
SAYING -- HE IS A GOOD GUY, AND 
WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS TERRIBLE. 
>> SO, IT IS UNCLEAR. 
>> TO SAY THE LEAST. 
>> RICKY, REAL QUICK -- 8 
GUILTY VERDICTS, ANY SENSE OF 
WHAT KIND OF SENTENCE THAT WILL 
BRING IF HE DOES NOT RECEIVE A 
PRESIDENTIAL PARDON? 
>> I CANNOT SAY THAT OFF THE 
TOP OF MY HEAD AND SPECULATION. 
BUT, WE HAVE HEARD IN THE PAST 
THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS INTENT 
ON RECOMMENDING 8-10 YEARS. 
THAT MAY BE WITH THE 18. 
WE DO NOT KNOW IF THEY WILL 
FEEL THE SAME ABOUT 8. RICKY 
KLEEMAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK NOW. 
MUCH MORE ON THIS NEXT ON RED 
AND BLUE.
