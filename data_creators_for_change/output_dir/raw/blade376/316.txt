1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,510
I guess the thing with opening up with

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,509
YouTube in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your thoughts and</font>

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:08,910
that is you can't control who watches it

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,340
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> care if you put on private but both</font>

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,020
over that I'm sorry who's obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font>

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,570
as a lot of your name and I'm usually

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,460
open with people quite at what most

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,960
people but it's usually done an

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,029
individual basis so exciting on this is

10
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,260
a bit different for me I know there'll

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,759
be people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who take the piss where you</font>

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,860
can give a fuck because all that matters

13
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the people who do take it seriously</font>

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,879
and people who do respond to this I go

15
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,460
free moments in life where I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

16
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> drive in or maybe an event or</font>

17
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">something or it might had a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to drink</font>

18
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,320
all I'm watching a movie<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I go</font>

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">through it deep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trainer for questioning</font>

20
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,219
existence why am I here in that and i'm

21
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,359
sure people go through that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i tell</font>

22
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,570
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> something sanger found with life is</font>

23
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,189
everyone desires the same thing where

24
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:10,560
people are open to each other people can

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,020
trust each other and people can love

26
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,560
each other tightly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they sexy filled</font>

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,130
recently when he posted a video about

28
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,439
you know folio he lost his brawny says

29
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,350
that he thinks it's time for everyone to

30
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,320
open up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to one another and you know show</font>

31
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">the love and to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> honest that's</font>

32
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,979
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know I think a lot of</font>

33
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,630
people desire and I've always wanted it

34
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,670
and I can honestly<font color="#CCCCCC"> say I'm sorry can</font>

35
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,380
turn around<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one of my friends and go</font>

36
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,640
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what man i love you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give them a</font>

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,540
hug and that sounds really cheesy but

38
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,750
why is it cheesy it's because people are

39
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,450
soft afraid of that and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

40
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,549
sound like quite a cross mackay and as I

41
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,290
put it sort of look but you know this

42
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">has come from me</font>

43
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,720
re always<font color="#CCCCCC"> question so much in life</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

44
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,060
as I've grown up<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've always been this</font>

45
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,040
way and it's an intimidating load of

46
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,758
people I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> always had the pit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Rick tell</font>

47
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:14,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">me because of it my members of my family</font>

48
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:16,739
always like half a<font color="#CCCCCC"> goal look you going</font>

49
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:18,810
off again and I mean if you read my film

50
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,120
script you'd realize of how it's been in

51
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,950
my family I mean I love my<font color="#E5E5E5"> family we get</font>

52
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,050
on so well but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just one issue and I</font>

53
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,940
was then begin questioning my sanity

54
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:33,180
never just watch the film flight club

55
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:39,330
and it ranks well it goes in a category

56
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,690
of the group of films which when I've

57
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,360
watched it I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very deep sinking</font>

58
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,060
feeling it within where it shocks me and

59
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,840
I become quite speechless because it

60
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,900
crosses over with my own questioning

61
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,630
questions of existence I guess and the

62
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,120
film's i'm told that going that category

63
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:06,109
of another sky donnie darko<font color="#CCCCCC"> gattaca</font>

64
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:10,230
fight club and saw a nice little more of

65
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,519
a trigger one but there are actually

66
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,890
serious issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that and I'll just</font>

67
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,930
watch fight club now and as soon as the

68
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:22,370
ending hit me I was just days

69
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,800
and something I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really good</font>

70
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,989
is we talked about opening up in that

71
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:29,670
and the best way of doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it through</font>

72
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,010
media it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of an accepted way I</font>

73
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,380
mean if I tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> this vlog without</font>

74
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,780
sound asunder without musical background

75
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,360
meet all right now the chances are you

76
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,650
wouldn't be feeling the emotion i'm

77
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,450
talking with right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> as much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as if i</font>

78
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,400
was to have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> music which he liked</font>

79
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,319
and you know made the hairs on the back

80
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,410
of your neck stand up and when i drive

81
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,390
and have that sort of music going it

82
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,940
makes me feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> good about life or it</font>

83
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:59,400
makes me get this level of you know deep

84
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:06,450
thought and this is crazy and we have

85
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,519
two paths in life we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can either live our</font>

86
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,239
life we have free pass<font color="#E5E5E5"> very behind live</font>

87
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,739
our life we kind of it just sit here and

88
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:15,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about it can do both and I'm sorry</font>

89
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,660
does both

90
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:22,190
and everything thats up in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> life has</font>

91
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,960
added to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this contribution of</font>

92
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:29,060
questioning and i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even 20 year how</font>

93
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,070
long we live for I don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how long</font>

94
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,780
our generation will because we live in a

95
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,130
generation of consumption

96
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,090
when I get upset<font color="#E5E5E5"> by things like and this</font>

97
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">sounds stupid people think I'll see you</font>

98
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,800
upset my thumb focal it wasn't it was

99
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,340
the thoughts it led to me thinking it's

100
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,750
all that interpretation I'm not going to

101
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,130
spoil the<font color="#E5E5E5"> movie</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> flea &</font>

102
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,930
I've talked about things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this going</font>

103
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to my best friend again some people</font>

104
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,850
believe that we don't go this is it this

105
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,140
is all we have it in once we've gone

106
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,480
were gone and then some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font>

107
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,190
when we die it continues and I just

108
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,700
don't know

109
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:21,380
if it would be desirable for us to just

110
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,940
disappear no for

111
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,789
and I'll tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> what my darkest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> secret</font>

112
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:39,759
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if i was to die tomorrow</font>

113
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,130
I wouldn't care and I'm so on he

114
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,280
honestly believes that people in the

115
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,260
short term would give a shit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

116
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,380
obviously close family would give a shit

117
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,300
but on a whole in terms of impact in the

118
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,870
world or impacts in the local area is

119
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,310
pretty insignificant sure there be maybe

120
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,110
morning generally with people who have

121
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">had contact with barking it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fair way</font>

122
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:09,020
people move on and someone like me who I

123
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,600
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to just have this impact on</font>

124
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the world</font>

125
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,440
the reality of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is maybe in the short</font>

126
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,510
term but the truth is

127
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,580
and then people say because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

128
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,610
do I hate life when I don't burn

129
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,700
frustrated and he goes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to issues i</font>

130
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,900
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is pretty much something up</font>

131
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,330
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> i feel like i've always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> felt both</font>

132
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">for like the relationship issue</font>

133
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,020
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could care less about me</font>

134
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,550
living for my cell phone and if that the

135
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,400
someone else just<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a reason to</font>

136
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,490
exist this is why do you see if I guess

137
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:01,689
it's what I want to do that's why I want

138
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:03,930
to live

139
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:15,300
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think about individuals in the</font>

140
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,820
past that are forwarding for and I think

141
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,280
of one individual who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> latest so much</font>

142
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,560
and she was such a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good friend and like</font>

143
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,900
she was silent for Nellie a chat with

144
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,340
when I finally did get in chat with her

145
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:36,060
and it went really well but she<font color="#CCCCCC"> left me</font>

146
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,750
on then went off she's like in a

147
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,240
relationship something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else now and it's</font>

148
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,470
the question of Wales could I have done

149
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,340
as much solar be over technically I

150
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,260
don't want to be to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point where I</font>

151
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,790
wishing that she breaks up with her

152
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:54,160
she's with now and there's obviously

153
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">other people I meet you I have an</font>

154
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,400
interesting but there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

155
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,139
where I look<font color="#E5E5E5"> back at local thing you</font>

156
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:03,480
know how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> I felt stronger for it</font>

157
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,750
when I just live life I type ID like

00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,090
half of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> path so I'm doing a bit of</font>

159
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,430
both living and thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it when I</font>

160
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,970
live life

161
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,770
it's all right it's pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> but what</font>

162
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,980
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about it it makes something ID</font>

163
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,300
seem so insignificant

164
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,010
because as much as we'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

165
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,380
significant the truth is probably that

166
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're not</font>

167
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,630
and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I lived life i enjoy i think</font>

168
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,780
i'm i'm a part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

169
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,570
it I<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize like how it's not what I</font>

170
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,630
want

171
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,890
aporia<font color="#E5E5E5"> musics this to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it seem a bit</font>

172
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:05,000
more what if it fits that but

173
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,190
I find that's really what not difficult

174
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:16,709
but like get emotional<font color="#E5E5E5"> and camera proper</font>

175
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:19,529
emotional you you see a more exposed

176
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:21,510
side of me i guess i'm always exposing

177
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:27,769
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i believe I feel so ship</font>

178
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:31,759
and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for any people I've had</font>

179
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,999
contact with in life I pissed off due to

180
00:09:33,999 --> 00:09:36,829
my self indulgent because that's the

181
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:39,619
right word behavior the fact that I do

182
00:09:39,619 --> 00:09:42,559
promote myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i do drive and do</font>

183
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,540
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to do it's a good thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">for many it pisses people off my man got</font>

185
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:52,279
at the moment when I live life is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to</font>

186
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:54,139

191
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,959
expense of pissing people off I just

192
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:09,369
wonder<font color="#E5E5E5"> what other people get it so easy</font>

193
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:12,769
if I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> having such good effect on people</font>

194
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:14,799
like people admit them while I being
