Jeremie I'd like to begin with you quoting The Washington Post tonight we'll put it up on the screen this statement came after White House officials pressured the Justice Department to issue a more forceful denial according to an advisor who spoke to the president the president asked advisors Friday if he should fire Rosenstein and some of those around Trump sought to sway him not to make any decision Friday night during those discussions the president said he did not trust Rosenstein or McCabe the adviser said what's your takeaway from all of this at this hour geremy and what are if anything are you expecting to see tomorrow over the weekend yeah I think we got pretty close tonight Brian to a Friday night massacre and people have been saying all night that the president now has the justification he needs to fire rod Rosen Stein and I think it's important to say no he does not this was information about conversations that happened during one meeting or a series of meetings on one day in May 2017 before the Muller investigation was kicked off before any of us knew about the Trump Tower meeting before the indictments of manna four and gates and Papadopoulos and Flynn and before the indictments of senior Russian officials who interfered in the 2016 election and I actually would argue Brian that if anything rod Rosenstein 'he's view of this situation probably has grown darker as the conspiracy has unspooled and has the obstruction has unfolded and I think even more so tonight more than ever we need to have an independent investigation that's led by Bob Muller and that's protected from political assault from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
