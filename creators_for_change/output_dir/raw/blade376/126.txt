5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,170
unable<font color="#CCCCCC"> to create</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the video that I wanted</font>

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,440
evaluated three times and thus I decided

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,210
it was not worth making<font color="#CCCCCC"> anymore</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but the</font>

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,920
project<font color="#E5E5E5"> will still go forward so all I</font>

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">can say is if you want more information</font>

13
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,199
changing exponentially in the world

14
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,029
right now and you know what frustrates

15
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,098
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> most how many people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> asleep</font>

16
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,590
and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just talking about strangers</font>

17
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,329
and people I see on my commute to and

18
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:38,790
from work I'm even<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about friends</font>

19
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,500
you know people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I know for almost</font>

20
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">two years now i could see mass civil</font>

21
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,390
unrest coming with a failing<font color="#E5E5E5"> global</font>

22
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,579
economic crisis but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i kept out to myself</font>

23
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people think</font>

24
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,809
you're crazy or a conspiracy theorist<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

25
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:54,210
you shouldn't doubt the system and

26
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,070
criticize it you should keep your head

27
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,899
down and<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything will be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright and</font>

28
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,489
i guess to a certain degree<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was</font>

29
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:01,140
believing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but the signs kept</font>

30
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,809
coming and now just looking at what's

31
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,519
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the world right now if that</font>

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,110
is not telling you<font color="#CCCCCC"> that something is</font>

33
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,240
seriously wrong then you really really

34
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,280
need a reality check my youtube channel

35
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,020
has always been about inspiring the

36
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,939
world to inspire<font color="#CCCCCC"> and trust me that is</font>

37
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,890
not going to change but<font color="#E5E5E5"> with everything</font>

38
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,990
developing so fast in the world I

39
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">realize I no longer need to spend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font>

40
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,400
my energy telling every individual

41
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,290
person I meet what is happening in the

42
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,729
world because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be long</font>

43
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:29,220
until this affects everyone and<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

44
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,710
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> how the fuck did this happen</font>

45
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,000
Occupy Wall<font color="#CCCCCC"> Street do you know where</font>

46
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is if you don't that's fine because</font>

47
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,040
for weeks now mainstream television news

48
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,200
networks and newspapers haven't listed

49
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,479
this event as an important news story

50
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,040
but then there are people who know about

51
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,079
Occupy Wall Street<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they're asking</font>

52
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions like why are they protesting</font>

53
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:50,369
why don't they get jobs well I have a

54
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:52,110
question for those people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that is</font>

55
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,640
why don't you do some proper research

56
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,380
but then there are mainstream news

57
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,719
networks like Fox News<font color="#CCCCCC"> and CNN who have</font>

58
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,759
journalists who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> even asking why are</font>

59
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,829
these protests happening I mean they

60
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:03,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">must be some pretty fucking amateur</font>

61
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,649
journalists if they're asking that

62
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:06,659
question weeks on after it started oh

63
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,250
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it's because they're also</font>

64
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,288
running funded by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the corporations that</font>

65
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:11,760
these people are protesting about

66
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,560
self-preservation comes to mind

67
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,800
so what's my<font color="#CCCCCC"> point pay no more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attention</font>

68
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,930
to traditional mainstream media

69
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,610
everybody because they have one main

70
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,410
function in society and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is to</font>

71
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,290
maintain the<font color="#E5E5E5"> status quo oh and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and to</font>

72
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,209
make money make that two points the fact

73
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:28,380
that you are watching<font color="#E5E5E5"> this video</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

74
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,810
now is evidence that you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> access to</font>

75
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,810
a tool which<font color="#CCCCCC"> can free you the internet</font>

76
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,849
become a journalist yourself search

77
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:38,220
around find your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own sources and come up</font>

78
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,780
with your own conclusions on the events

79
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,800
that are happening in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

80
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,840
now just don't be spoon fed by these

81
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,060
elite funded news networks that only

82
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,950
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> out information tainted by their</font>

83
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,750
own agenda constructed information

84
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,880
shouldn't just be about opinion anyway

85
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,380
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be about reporting actual</font>

86
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,299
research and using critical thinking

87
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,670
most of the major news networks are

88
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,560
influenced<font color="#CCCCCC"> by those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that fund them and</font>

89
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,780
most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> governments are influenced</font>

90
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,239
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> those that fund them so do yourself a</font>

91
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,810
favor and open your<font color="#E5E5E5"> eyes realize</font>

92
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,220
empathize with the real<font color="#CCCCCC"> world around you</font>

93
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,340
and shed<font color="#CCCCCC"> some light because trust me</font>

94
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,959
those that live their life sipping

95
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,209
champagne and counting their money don't

96
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:17,190
give a fuck about you and the sooner you

97
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,049
realize that the sooner we can take

98
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:20,519
constructive action to find solutions

99
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">and allow these people to give a fuck</font>

100
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,239
about their fellow human beings again

101
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,400
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason they are that</font>

102
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,959
way is because the system has allowed

103
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,819
them to be they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not evil people</font>

104
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">they've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> brought up in an</font>

105
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:33,840
environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> in which money comes first</font>

106
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,600
corporate greed over human need<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yes</font>

107
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,090
I hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people say but ignorance</font>

108
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,220
