a lot to get to this morning we're going to start though with the latest in the disappearance of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi who walked into Saudi Arabia's consulate in Turkey on October 2nd and has not been seen since turkish President Erdogan says investigators found quote toxic material at the consulate and that parts had just been repainted while Turkey's foreign minister said police planned to search the home of the saudi consul general after that official suddenly left the country and several Saudi diplomatic vehicles and the AP reports surveillance video shows the vehicles traveling to the Consul generals residence shortly after Khashoggi entered the consulate this as Turkish officials provided NBC News with the photo and bio pages of seven Saudi passports belonging to members of the 15-person Saudi hit team they believe is responsible while the New York Times identifies one of the suspects claiming he has been a frequent companion of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman seen with him in Paris Madrid and around the United States The Times reports cites witness and records to link three others to the crown prince's security detail as well as an autopsy expert said to hold senior positions in Saudi Arabia's interior ministry and its medical establishment in all the time says it has independently confirmed that at least nine of the 15 worked for the Saudi government so many questions being raised here Willie and with all that in mind the president United States appears to be defending the Saudi Arabian side in an oval office interview with The Associated Press yesterday President Trump said this spoke to the crown prince he said he and his father knew nothing about it and that was very important I spoke to the king yesterday the crown prince today wanted to know what was going on what was happening and he said very strongly that he and his father knew nothing about it the AP then asked if during that conversation whether his remarks about quote rogue killers came up the president replied this way well the concept of it I guess yesterday when I spoke with the father not so much today but when I spoke to the father it just sounded to me like he felt like he did not do it he did not know about it and it sounded like you know the concept of rogue killers but I don't know that was just for my feeling of the conversation with the King on the idea of trusting the Saudis the president said well I think we have to find out what happened first you know here we go again with you know you're guilty until proven innocent I don't like that we just went through that with justice Cavanaugh and he was innocent all the way so I was unconcerned but I will say they were very strong in their denial about themselves knowing meanwhile Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met yesterday in Riyadh with King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman who was suspected of personally ordering the operation to lure Khashoggi from his home in Virginia to Saudi Arabia I don't want to talk about any of the facts they didn't want to either and that they want to have the opportunity to complete this investigation in a thorough way Jeffrey Grover what do you think as you look at that image of the Secretary of State smiling next to the crown prince of Saudi Arabia who has now been credibly accused of ordering the murder of a Washington Post columnist where to begin with all this first by the way can I say that I'm sure Brett Kavanaugh is not thrilled wait are the Saudi secret police but we'll put that aside for a second all right look let's let's be let's be real here we have allies around the world our allies sometimes do terrible things as our adversaries also do so this is this is more baroque than usual but it's not of a different order entirely I think what's going on is is this Mike Pompeo is the lead figure in the administration's effort to contain and isolate Iran this Saudi operation in Turkey could ruin all of their best-laid plans to essentially destroy or undermine the Iranian me and I think Pompeo they're smiling he's smiling for a reason they need the Saudis desperately to engage in this plan Saudi Arabia has to keep the oil flowing if Iran's oil gets cut off and so this is realpolitik that it's most real something this is so the cost jeff of this plan for iran is if a journalist is murdered a resident of virginia washington post columnist so be it it seems that way so far unless the administration changes its tune but it seems as if the president is desperate to move past this and obviously this whole oj if they did it sort of thing is as part of that it seems as if they won't be able to do that entirely because this this episode is so horrific and so baroque and so horrible that the world is it i think there's physical repulsion yeah to your point like Saudi Arabia's been involved in what is essentially a humanitarian disaster in Yemen and we've been utterly comfortable with never been sweetie I mean and so we're comfortable with that this obviously hits at a more visceral level because first of all it's one of our own but also it's a yeah basically you know that there's Russian a Russian sitting somewhere going boy it took fifteen guys with a bone saw to do this to guys in a park you know I mean it's not but they've they if the if this is all true they killed the guy in the one place where they had no deniability it's it's unbelievable on so many ways Soros our friend Richard Haass the Council on Foreign Relations tweeted about the old trust but verify Reagan doctor and becoming trust but look away trust and look away when you look at the president saying well Russia says it didn't interfere well kim jong-in says he's going to denuclearize well the crown prince says he did not order the killing of jamal Khashoggi i don't think we can look away from this because of the image which will forever be burned in our mind not only that he was a part shootin post reporter but we watched him go into that place and never come out that's somehow we can imagine what might have happened sometimes pictures make something more visceral the word you use than an abstract human rights it was already wrong the way the president talked about we're getting billions of dollars so it's okay that he rights is violated but now you think about those pictures have made a difference the little girl who was running down the street after napalm bombing in Vietnam the person falling out of the World Trade Center made all those killings real there's a sense in which when you see an image of something it somehow gets into your heart and soul and I don't think we're gonna forget this unless we're on overload I mean that's the problem those other images made such a difference even in world war two they never showed a dead soldier until finally 1943 and even then that soldier was sleeping because somehow it made real hundreds of thousands of people that were dying around the world this has become real it's every kid's fear somebody goes away and doesn't come back and so I think it's gonna be harder for them yeah Jeffrey Goldberg you know you see private companies pulling away from the Saudis you see them stepping up but what we have right now is President Trump on the international world stage lying about financial ties with Saudi Arabia saying to the Saudis in essence he's with them he doesn't know if he was murdered or not he doesn't necessarily distrust them he might trust them he's playing both sides on the international stage clearly siding almost with the Saudis he's appearing weak feckless and easily manipulated we all know that but I feel like some might argue that this is a massive fail on the Secretary of State's part so he needed to step up and have some strong language there I mean if members of this administration are going to fill the void that this president clearly puts out there then do it are they going to let president Trump bring us down internationally and isn't that what we are seeing here you know I I would take a slightly different tack than this and I'm trying to view it from the Middle East out rather they're from Washington in New York in and and what I mean by that isn't the following remember that the Arabs the moderate the so-called moderate Arabs never forgave Barack Obama for what they saw is cutting loose Hosni Mubarak the leader of Egypt what's happening right now across the Middle East is people are looking at Trump in my phone Palin said these guys have our back no matter what that's what a friend does that's what an ally does I'm not sure this is being interpreted as weak and feckless in the Middle East that's being interpreted as this is these are the rules this is the this is this is not a happy place this is not a friendly place it's a brutal place and sometimes we go a little bit too far and we get into a little bit too much trouble but the president United States our historic ally has our back they are they're thanking God right now that they have Donald Trump and not Barack Obama the business we've chosen this is a business look this is this is straight mafia I mean you know what's going on here I do think we need to just address one other component that sort of this weird elephant in the room here which is we have the opaqueness of the Trump financial records that could be coloring a lot of this we do not know the extent to which he and his family have financial ties to the Saturday's we do not know the extent to which Kushner and his family have financial ties to the Saudis I'm not saying this is determinative I actually with Jeff I think they put a huge geopolitical investment on the Saudis and that's probably what's playing out right here which is they can't undo that but I do think that it is probably affecting some of the president's reactions is it certainly explains why he was preemptively talking about how he doesn't have any financial ties societies even though there was a public paper trail showing that he does so Jeffery it sounds like what you're saying is this is sort of baked in and that the president is making perhaps a cynical but a smart political play I mean when Doris talks about images rightly talking about images there are plenty of images of the famine in Yemen their play of images of civilian children killed on school buses in the saudi-led american-backed war there but the president has made a calculation that his relationship with Saudi Arabia is more important than the life of this journalist the the president has two things going for him one our attention span and overload as you talked about there's the hope that in another week or two or three or four maybe the Washington Post will get off its campaign or something like that having the scandal go to the next skin I mean this is a soui generous kid this is a really kind of crazy scandal obviously compared to most scandals that we deal with and the second thing he has going for him is that Saudi Arabia's enemies are just as terrible in there Wright's behaviors and in there at non-adherence the democratic norms in the rule of law we're talking about Iran and Qatar Turkey jails more journalists than any other country so it's it's you know that it's this is the Middle East we're talking about and so he's picked that you know you can say he's picked the terrible Middle East country that happens to like us rather than the terrible Middle East country that doesn't like us and that that he has it going long-term in his favor what's interesting Bob Costas is though you have congressional Republican senators like Lindsey Graham saying pretty clearly on television on Fox News and other places that if the president will act on this Congress will that they are outraged by this even if the president is not what does that mean what does that turn into what is that action potentially well it's a complicated moment politically for the Republican Party talking to my top sources last night Willie they said this is perhaps the real October Surprise not the the Cavanaugh confirmation and that you have human rights and foreign policy being now injected into the midterm campaign just weeks ahead of the election and most of these lawmakers are now back home in their districts trying to save their seats and whether it's in the Senate or the house and they're really looking to the White House for cues about how to handle this but there's this indecision inside of the GOP because they're not here really in Washington about whether to move forward with sanctions to take a harder line against Saudi Arabia or not do you risk going against President Trump in his line and based on your reporting Bob because you are so wired in in Washington what is the calculus from the White House right now we know that Jared Kushner has a very close relationship with NBS are they helping Saudi Arabia through this are they helping them concoct the plan whatever the story is going to be that it was an accidental death perhaps of The Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi White House officials say the president views this not so much through a foreign policy or ideological prism but through his transactional prism he sees world politics to something that's about what are you giving the United States what is the United States getting in return for what it gives and on Saudi Arabia whether it's the arm Steel oil it's its geopolitical position in the Middle East he values that he keeps articulating that privately inside of the west wing as something he wants to protect which has made him even as he lashes out at miss Daniels he's staying relatively in his a steady position on Saudi Arabia not taking any kind of firm position on human rights Doris Kearns Goodwin you studied presidential leadership does this look like United States presidential leadership or would you argue like Madeleine Albright does that we are leading down a very different path here and all the pieces are fitting together towards someone who's trying to make this a dictatorship you know I problem with using words like fascism or dictatorship is I think the pattern of behavior that we're seeing may be leading in that direction and you just want to be able to persuade other people to look at this president my argument would be to look at whether he's a leader or not what does a leader normally do a leader normally takes blame when things are wrong and leader normally shares credit when things are right a leader normally builds a team that's built with people who are strong-minded and can argue with them and then you get a purpose in that team leader normally controls his negative emotions a leader normally communicates honestly and with truth and I think if we can just show that he's not necessarily a leader that's bad enough rather than putting a label on him yet when the Muller investigation comes out we may well see the rule of law being denied and then we have to go after him but right now we have to expand the people who look at him and see that this is not right what's happening rather than turning them away by using a term like that okay so pull back on the term but every question or every check that you put out there for this president is know exactly exactly exactly so I'm saying what just say word that we can use we can't use certain words apparently because he uses any word he wants to use I understand that you don't want to overreach but tell us where we are right now in the process of devolving the presidency if you think that is happening I do think the fact that there's no shared political truth that there are lies there are fabrications there are alternate facts is a really troubling thing I do think the fact that he is deliberately dividing the country rather than trying to bring us together and Jeffrey and I were talking about that beforehand other presidents may have done that but this is being done deliberately what a president normally does look at these moments of triumph II had at the inauguration who could have tried to bring us together he didn't after the Cavanagh hearings when he was triumphs and he got the Supreme Court justice he wanted his party wanted into the court and what does he do he mocks he mocks dr. Ford and he talks about the Democrats as horrible horrible people even after he won this suit evidently the other day over stormy Daniels what do I do they just keep quiet instead of having to call her names there's a feeling about him that the only joy he ever gets is when he's fighting somebody rather than the exhilaration even of a victory and that's not an ordinary leader you should be taking problems and feeling great when something solved or when you've been victorious but instead he comes to life when he's arguing with other people and calling them names so all of those things are not what a leader is and we have to focus on that leadership is what some matters and then we can figure out what to label him as things go down the line and we may be reaching that point if he were to do something with the Moller investigation and stop it then clearly we have to talk about the rule of law and dictatorship Doris Kearns Goodwin thank you very much Robert Costa thank you for your reporting and still ahead on Morning Joe Lindsey Graham has been towing the president's line a lot lately but yesterday he did not he had a far tougher position on Saudi Arabia than the administration has plus President Trump has no financial ties to the Saudi Kingdom that is if you ignore the yacht the real estate the long-standing business ties so what is he claiming something that is so easily disproved former CIA director and NBC analyst John Brennan joins us next on Morning Joe thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more 4 Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
