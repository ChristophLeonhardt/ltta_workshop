00:00:08,898 --> 00:00:11,234
GREG: A 5-GALLON TUB OF ICE

2
00:00:11,234 --> 00:00:20,944
CREAM AND MICHAEL'S MORE BED --

3
00:00:20,944 --> 00:00:21,978
IT DOES NOT EVEN NEED A

4
00:00:21,978 --> 00:00:22,345
PROTOTYPE.

5
00:00:22,345 --> 00:00:24,380
THE DEMOCRATS MENTOR MADE IS

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,183
DISAPPEARING FAST TRACK I GOT TO

7
00:00:27,183 --> 00:00:31,554
APPLAUSE LINES.

8
00:00:31,554 --> 00:00:33,957
THE REAL CLEAR POLITICS THE DEMS

9
00:00:33,957 --> 00:00:41,798
HAVE LOST A THIRD OF ITS LEAD IN

10
00:00:41,798 --> 00:00:42,999
THE LAST TWO MONTHS IN THE SAME

11
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:43,766
TIMEFRAME TRUMPS POPULARITY IS

12
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:44,734
RISING IN PLACES WHERE DEMS

13
00:00:44,734 --> 00:00:45,602
THOUGHT THEY HAD A CHANCE.

14
00:00:45,602 --> 00:00:46,302
ORANGE COUNTIES, CALIFORNIA.

15
00:00:46,302 --> 00:00:50,907
THEREFORE TIGHT RACES THERE BUT

16
00:00:50,907 --> 00:00:51,774
TRUMPS APPROVAL RATING GREW TEN

17
00:00:51,774 --> 00:00:52,742
POINTS IN THE LAST COUPLE

18
00:00:52,742 --> 00:00:53,076
MONTHS.

19
00:00:53,076 --> 00:00:54,177
THEY DON'T CALL IT ORANGE FOR

20
00:00:54,177 --> 00:00:54,510
NOTHING.

21
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:54,878
[LAUGHTER]

22
00:00:54,878 --> 00:01:05,120
KIND OF OBVIOUS.

23
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,189
COMPANIES GIVE BONUSES TO THEIR

24
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:07,223
EMPLOYEES AFTER TRUMPS TAX CUTS

25
00:01:07,223 --> 00:01:08,458
LIKE A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER WHO

26
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:09,959
REMINDED NANCY PELOSI AT A TOWN

27
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,427
HALL THAT SHE CALLED THE BONUSES

28
00:01:11,427 --> 00:01:11,828
CRUMBS.

29
00:01:11,828 --> 00:01:12,795
>> IT CERTAINLY WAS NOT CRUMBS

30
00:01:12,795 --> 00:01:13,129
TO THEM.

31
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:25,341
MY QUESTION IS WHAT CAN YOU ADD

32
00:01:25,341 --> 00:01:26,409
TO THIS LEGISLATION THAT WOULD

33
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:27,911
ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE GROWTH OF

34
00:01:27,911 --> 00:01:29,345
JOBS AND WAGES IN OUR COUNTRY?

35
00:01:29,345 --> 00:01:30,213
>> IT'S ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE

36
00:01:30,213 --> 00:01:31,347
OF BUSINESSES SHARED THEIR TAX

37
00:01:31,347 --> 00:01:32,348
ADVANTAGE WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES

38
00:01:32,348 --> 00:01:33,149
SO LET US THANK --

39
00:01:33,149 --> 00:01:33,516
[APPLAUSE]

40
00:01:33,516 --> 00:01:34,150
GREG: APPLAUDING HER OWN

41
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:34,484
COMMENT.

42
00:01:34,484 --> 00:01:35,818
SHE WILL NEVER LIVE DOWN THAT

43
00:01:35,818 --> 00:01:36,219
CRUMBS LINE.

44
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:41,357
IF LIKE ME IN THAT INCIDENT AND

45
00:01:41,357 --> 00:01:41,691
WALMART.

46
00:01:41,691 --> 00:01:42,525
TECHNICALLY, I WAS WEARING

47
00:01:42,525 --> 00:01:42,825
PANTS.

48
00:01:42,825 --> 00:01:56,039
MY ADVICE TO DEMOCRATS IS

49
00:02:04,881 --> 00:02:05,682
NOT HAVING SOLUTIONS AND ALSO

50
00:02:05,682 --> 00:02:06,616
HAVE THIS PERSON CAMPAIGN FOR

51
00:02:06,616 --> 00:02:07,050
EVERYONE.

52
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,116
>> HAVING SAID ALL THIS, WHY

53
00:02:08,116 --> 00:02:09,519
AREN'T I 50 POINTS AHEAD, YOU

54
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:09,919
MIGHT ADD?

55
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,087
GREG: CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THAT.

56
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:11,521
ALL RIGHT.

57
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:12,889
CHRIS, WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON

58
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:13,990
THE DEMOCRATIC BECAUSE THERE'S A

59
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,358
BLUE WAVE TURNING INTO A BLUE

60
00:02:15,358 --> 00:02:15,725
GRAVE?

61
00:02:15,725 --> 00:02:16,592
>> MY IMMEDIATE THOUGHTS WERE I

62
00:02:16,592 --> 00:02:18,227
LIKE THE GUYS ENERGY WHO HAS THE

63
00:02:18,227 --> 00:02:18,594
QUESTION.

64
00:02:18,594 --> 00:02:20,229
HE WAS PULLING UP ALL DAY AND

65
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:21,798
I'M AN ESSAY [INAUDIBLE] SO THEN

66
00:02:21,798 --> 00:02:23,599
HE WAS LIKE WHEN HE SAID CRUMBS

67
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,934
HE SAID CRUMBS LIKE -- YOU KNOW

68
00:02:24,934 --> 00:02:26,636
I WAS JUST WAITING FOR BE LIKE

69
00:02:26,636 --> 00:02:27,670
NAILED IT UNDER HIS BREATH.

70
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,604
BUT, I DON'T KNOW.

71
00:02:28,604 --> 00:02:37,480
YOU DON'T NOTICE IT BECAUSE I

72
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,915
ALWAYS LISTEN TO PAUL'S BUT YOU

73
00:02:38,915 --> 00:02:39,849
DON'T NOTICE WHENEVER TRUMP

74
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:41,351
SUPPORTER IS UP OR DOWN AND

75
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:42,585
PRETTY MUCH IT'S THE SAME BUT

76
00:02:42,585 --> 00:02:46,389
EVERY NOW AND THEN THERE'S A

77
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:49,959
TRINKET OF A FRIEND IS NOT AS

00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:50,994

00:02:50,994 --> 00:02:51,160

MEANING OR THEY'RE WILLING TO BG

94
00:02:52,295 --> 00:02:52,562
OUT.

95
00:02:52,562 --> 00:02:53,730
IT'S COMING OUT AS A TRUMP

96
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:54,097
SUPPORTER.

97
00:02:54,097 --> 00:02:54,630
GREG: IT'S TRUE.

98
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,498
>> IT'S THE NEW THING AND

99
00:02:55,498 --> 00:02:56,199
PARENTS NOW, CONSERVATIVE

100
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,800
PARENTS, TALK TO THE KIDS AND WE

101
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,402
LOVE YOU NO MATTER WHAT AND WE

102
00:02:59,402 --> 00:03:06,209
LOOK TO YOUR INTERNET HISTORY,

103
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:07,276
SEARCHING FOR A PARTICULAR RED

104
00:03:07,276 --> 00:03:09,012
HAT AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU LIKE

105
00:03:09,012 --> 00:03:09,679
TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING.

106
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:10,513
GREG: IT IS SO TRUE.

107
00:03:10,513 --> 00:03:11,447
YOU SEE CELEBRITIES PUTTING

108
00:03:11,447 --> 00:03:13,616
THEIR TOE IN THE WATER SAYING

109
00:03:13,616 --> 00:03:14,884
MAYBE GIVE THE GUY A CHANCE.

110
00:03:14,884 --> 00:03:16,185
IT'S EXACTLY LIKE COMING OUT FOR

111
00:03:16,185 --> 00:03:16,686
HOLLYWOOD AFTER.

112
00:03:16,686 --> 00:03:20,556
NOT THAT I WOULD NO, TYRUS.

113
00:03:20,556 --> 00:03:24,193
[LAUGHTER]

114
00:03:24,193 --> 00:03:25,361
CAN THE REPUBLICAN STILL SCREW

115
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:25,728
THIS UP?

116
00:03:25,728 --> 00:03:27,063
TYRUS: WHY THE HELL YOU TALKING

117
00:03:27,063 --> 00:03:28,598
TO ME ABOUT COMING OUT?

118
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:41,010
I SCREAM [INAUDIBLE]

119
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:41,377
[LAUGHTER]

120
00:03:41,377 --> 00:03:42,178
GREG: CAN THE REPUBLICANS MESSES

121
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:42,445
UP.

122
00:03:42,445 --> 00:03:43,479
TYRUS: NO, THEY DON'T HAVE TO.

123
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,213
STATISTICALLY TYPICALLY WHEN

124
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:45,448
THERE'S A CHANGE IN THE

125
00:03:45,448 --> 00:03:46,282
PRESIDENCY USUALLY IN THE

126
00:03:46,282 --> 00:03:47,550
MIDTERMS GO THE OTHER WAY BUT

127
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,352
THE TENANTS TO BE A BALANCE

128
00:03:49,352 --> 00:03:52,422
THERE'S A DEMOCRATIC HOUSE OR

129
00:03:52,422 --> 00:03:53,356
SENATE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT IN

130
00:03:53,356 --> 00:04:06,469
THE HOUSE IS USUALLY

131
00:04:24,954 --> 00:04:26,122
BOTCHED THIS UP GOING ALL THE

132
00:04:26,122 --> 00:04:26,923
WAY BACK TO OBAMA.

133
00:04:26,923 --> 00:04:28,191
OBAMA ONE IN SPITE OF THE

134
00:04:28,191 --> 00:04:29,592
DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THEY ARE IN

135
00:04:29,592 --> 00:04:30,960
SUCH SHAMBLES THEY HAVE NOTHING

136
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,295
THEY ARE RUNNING ON OTHER THAN

137
00:04:32,295 --> 00:04:33,996
WE DON'T LIKE THAT GUY AND THAT

138
00:04:33,996 --> 00:04:35,398
IS NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN VOTE

139
00:04:35,398 --> 00:04:35,665
FOR.

140
00:04:35,665 --> 00:04:36,432
GREG: THAT'S A GOOD POINT ABOUT

141
00:04:36,432 --> 00:04:36,732
OBAMA.

142
00:04:36,732 --> 00:04:37,967
THEY RELIED SO MUCH ON OBAMA

143
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:38,601
DIDN'T FIX THE PARTY.

144
00:04:38,601 --> 00:04:39,569
TYRUS: AND NOW THE PARTY --

145
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:40,269
POSTAL MEAN ANYTHING.

146
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:40,903
WE LEARNED THAT.

147
00:04:40,903 --> 00:04:41,771
LITERALLY POSE MEAN ABSOLUTELY

148
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:43,139
NOTHING BUT IF YOU FOLLOW THE

149
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:44,574
POLLS HILLARY WON IN A LANDSLIDE

150
00:04:44,574 --> 00:04:45,575
BUT THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.

151
00:04:45,575 --> 00:04:46,142
POLES ARE MISLEADING.

152
00:04:46,142 --> 00:04:47,510
THE BIG LEAD WAS NEVER A BIG

153
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:47,810
LEAD.

154
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:48,978
I THINK MOST TRUMP SUPPORTERS

155
00:04:48,978 --> 00:04:50,146
AND MOST PUBLICANS THAT WENT

156
00:04:50,146 --> 00:04:51,581
THAT WAY WERE LIVING THEIR LIVES

157
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:52,949
IN PARTING AND NOT ANSWERING THE

158
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:53,883
PHONE TO SAMPLING DEMOCRAT

159
00:04:53,883 --> 00:04:54,984
BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE

160
00:04:54,984 --> 00:04:56,385
THAT WANT TO BE HEARD AND I

161
00:04:56,385 --> 00:04:57,553
DON'T THINK OR HEAR ANY

162
00:04:57,553 --> 00:04:58,121
SOLUTIONS OR IDEAS.

163
00:04:58,121 --> 00:04:59,388
GREG: SOMETIMES THAT CAN WORK,

164
00:04:59,388 --> 00:05:00,590
ROB, BUT AMERICANS ARE GETTING

165
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,125
USED TO THE IDEA OF PRESIDENT

166
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,359
TRUMP SAID WHEN THEY HEAR THE

167
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,760
NEGATIVITY THEY SEE IT AS A

168
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,561
NEGATIVE PERSON'S FLAWS NOT

169
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:05,962
TRUMPS.

170
00:05:05,962 --> 00:05:06,562
>> THAT IS THE ISSUE.

171
00:05:06,562 --> 00:05:11,501
I'M FORTUNATE BUT I TRAVELED

172
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:12,735
AROUND THE COUNTRY AND SPEAK TO

173
00:05:12,735 --> 00:05:13,970
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE PERSONALLY A

174
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,371
WEEK AND THEY'RE TIRED OF THE

175
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:15,838
IMPEACHED TALK.

176
00:05:15,838 --> 00:05:18,674
THE TIDE OF THE NEGATIVITY.

177
00:05:18,674 --> 00:05:19,842
THEY WANT AMERICA TO WORK

178
00:05:19,842 --> 00:05:21,310
TOGETHER IN THE MEDIA WILL NOT

179
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:21,878
TELL YOU THAT.

180
00:05:21,878 --> 00:05:23,913
LIKE I SAID, I SAT ON HIS COUCH

181
00:05:23,913 --> 00:05:26,649
AND HAD SOMEONE SAID THAT THE

182
00:05:26,649 --> 00:05:27,783
WAY THAT DONALD TROUBLE GET

183
00:05:27,783 --> 00:05:28,751
ELECTED BECAUSE THE POLLS SAY

184
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:29,051
THIS.

185
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:30,386
NANCY PELOSI IS UP THERE SAYING

186
00:05:30,386 --> 00:05:32,455
AND APPLAUDING HER OWN COMMENTS

187
00:05:32,455 --> 00:05:34,790
AS A THIS DOES WORK FOR MOST AND

188
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,292
YOU'RE ONE OF THE FEW BUT SHE'S

THAT WILL NOT ATTRACT VOTERS
