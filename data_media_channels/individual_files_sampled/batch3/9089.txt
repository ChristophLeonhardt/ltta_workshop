HOME OF THE U.S. OPEN SEE IT ON FOX SPORTS 1 OVER THE WEEKEND. IT IS FRIDAY. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, "NOTABLE QUOTABLES." CANADIANS WE'RE POLITE, WE'RE REASONABLE BUT WE ALSO WILL NOT BE PUSHED AROUND. THERE IS A SPECIAL PLACE IN HELL FOR ANY FOREIGN LEADER THAT ENGAGES IN BAD FAITH DIPLOMACY WITH PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP. OR TRUMP. I'M NOT SURE WHAT ACTIVITY HE IS ASKING ME TO UNDERTAKE IN EITHER. HE'S HAPPY. BIGGEST SHOWOFF OF THE 21st CENTURY. GO VIRAL ON SOCIAL MEDIA. WE DEVELOPED A VERY SPECIAL BOND. KIM JONG UN. HE'S A BUTCHER. WORKING WITH HIM. HE IS A KILLER: EXECUTING PEOPLE. HE HAS DONE SOME REALLY BAD THINGS. YEAH. BUT SO HAVE A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE. NEGOTIATE WITH DONALD TRUMP. IT PAYS TO HAVE A NUCLEAR BOMB IN YOUR POCKET I THINK HE MAY BE GOING THE EXTRA MILE. YOU CAN ATTACK ME ALL YOU WANT. I'M USED TO IT I ENJOY IT HOWEVER, WHEN IT COMES TO ATTACKING STAFF, THAT'S WHEN YOU HAVE GONE TOO FAR. GET A GOOD PICTURE OF EVERYBODY SO WE ARE NICE AND HANDSOME, THIN. I GOT A LOT OF NICE GOOD KISSES. NOT TODAY OR TOMORROW OR AT ANY POINT EVER GOING TO COMMENT ON RUDY GIULIANI'S LOVE LIFE. I WILL SAY MAKES ME FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. IF IT WAS VAUDVILLE IT WOULD BE A LOT BETTER SPEECH.
