>>> WELCOME BACK.
ALL EYES ON PRESIDENT TRUMP AND
KIM JONG-UN AHEAD OF THE
HISTORIC SUMMIT.
NEW REPORTS NOW SAYING THAT SOME
OF HIS ATTENTION COULD BE
SINISTER.
AUTHORITIES WARNING ABOUT A
POTENTIAL WAVE OF CHINESE SPIES
PLANTED ALL OVER SINGAPORE.
BUGGING HOTEL ROOMS,
INFILTRATING SUMMIT STAFF.
SO WHAT IS THE U.S. DOING TO
STOP THEM?
HERE WITH INTEL SENIOR FELLOW AT
THE CENTER FOR DIGITAL
GOVERNMENT MORGAN WRIGHT.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
>> HI.
>> THIS IS A PART OF THE STORY,
MAYBE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
PIECES OF IT.
BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO SPYING,
CHAI GNAT MIGHT BE THE MOST
SOPHISTICATED WHEN IT COMES TO
THIS.
WHAT IS THE U.S. INTEL DOING TO
COMBAT THIS?
IS IT POSSIBLE?
>> YOU TAKE SOME BASIC COUNTER
MEASURES.
THE CHINESE ARE GOING TO TRY TO
GIVE OUT EVERYTHING FROM ROOM
KEYS TO PHONES.
THEY JUST BANNED THE ZTE PHONES
ON MILITARY BASES.
BUT IT'S THE HUMAN COMPROMISE OF
THIS.
THEY'VE BEEN ON THE ISLAND FOR A
LONG TIME BUT FOCUSED ON IT
TRYING TO COMPROMISE EVERYBODY
FROM THE WAIT STAFF TO PEOPLE
WORKING AT THE HOTEL, THE
AIRPORT.
NOT ONLY IN SINGAPORE BUT IN
CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES.
THE OPM BREACH FROM 2015, GUESS
WHAT, THAT'S MAYING
WHAT, THAT'S PAYING BIG
DIVIDENDS FOR THE CHIES KNEE.
>> YOU HAVE TO GO OVER A BRIDGE
OR A SUBWAY TO GET THERE WHICH
IS WHY THEY PICKED THAT
LOCATION, THEY CAN CLOSE IT OFF
FROM EVERYBODY ELSE.
IS THERE A PLACE IN THE HOTEL
THAT YOU KNOW FOR SURE WILL NOT
BE BUGGED, WHERE THEY'RE
MEETING, YOU HAVE NO CONCERNS
ABOUT THAT?
>> YOU NEVER SAY NEVER.
THAT'S ONE OF THE LESSONS YOU
LEARNED IN THE INTELLIGENCE
COMMITTEE.
BUT THEY'LL HAVE THE BEST OF THE
BEST, THEY'LL SWEEP THAT ROOM,
LOCK IT DOWN, PROTECT IT.
ANYBODY THAT'S LOOKING AT
CLASSIFIED MATERIAL IS GOING TO
BE, YOU KNOW, INSIDE OF TENTS,
INSIDE OF PLACES WHERE YOU CAN'T
HAVE CAMERAS LOOKING AT IT.
THE BIGGEST THING THAT THE
CHINESE WANT IS THE INFORMATION
WITH WE'RE USING FOR THE
NEGOTIATIONS.
CHINESE ARE LEARNING TO FIND OUT
WHAT OUR CAPABILITIES ARE AS
MUCH OZ WHAT OUR NEGOTIATING
POSITION IS.
>> CHINA IS 90% OF TRADE WITH
NORTH KOREA.
THEY'RE BASICALLY THE ONES THAT
KEEP NORTH KOREA AFLOAT.
THEY CARE FOR MAN ANYBODY ABOUT
