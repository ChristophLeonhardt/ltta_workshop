THE SANCTIONS IN NORTH KOREA ABIDED BY, OPENED NEW POSSIBILITIES. Dana: GERMAN CHANCELLOR MERKEL MOMENTS AGO GIVING PRESIDENT TRUMP SOME PROPS ON NORTH KOREA. JOINING ME IS MICHAEL ALLEN. HE'S A FORMER MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL. THIS DOES FEEL LIKE KIND OF A MOMENTOUS DAY. I JUST HAD A TWEET FROM SOMEONE TELLING ME HIS FATHER WAS IN KOREA. HE WAS STATIONED IN KOREA. HIS SON IS STATIONED IN KOREA. AND TODAY FEELS LIKE A DAY, THOUGH OF COURSE AS ARI FLEISHER SAID, THOUGH THERE IS REASON TO BE CAUTIOUS. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT HERE. I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PROBABLY RIGHT TO TRY AND TEST THE INTENTIONS OF THE NEW LEADER. IT MAY BE THAT HE SEES THE WAY FORWARD IN THE FUTURE FOR THE NORTH KOREAN ECONOMY. IT'S TANKING. IT'S TERRIBLE. IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE. IT PROBABLY MAKES SENSE, WHILE NOT TAKING ANY OF YOUR CRIPPLING SANCTIONS OFF THE TABLE, TO SORT OF TEST THE WATERS HERE AND SEE IF THIS GUY CAN MAKE GOOD ON WHAT HE'S SAYING. Dana: IN ADDITION, THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT IRAN THIS WEEK AND THE IRAN DEAL. I WONDER WHAT YOU THOUGHT ANGELA MERKEL NEEDED TO GET OUT OF THIS MEETING WHEN IT CAME TO IRAN AND WAS SHE ABLE TO GO HOME WITH ANYTHING? DOESN'T SOUND LIKE TOO MUCH. SOUNDS LIKE THE PRESIDENT IS OPEN TO HEARING WHAT THE EUROPEAN POWERS HAVE TO SAY. BUT LISTEN, WE STILL NEED THREE THINGS IN ORDER TO STAY IN THIS DEAL. THE MOST IMPORTANT OF WHICH IS, WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PUT A LONGER PERIOD TO THIS DEAL. WE DON'T NEED SUN SEATS HERE IN THE NEXT 5, 12 YEARS, THAT'S THE STRATEGIC PATIENCE PATH WAY. THE EUROPEANS NEED TO UNITE WITH US AND TRY TO IMPROVE THE DEAL SO WE MIGHT STAY IN. Dana: LET ME ALSO ASK YOU ABOUT READ TO YOU FROM "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" THIS MORNING, SAYING ON THE EVE OF A TRUMP/KIM JONG-UN SUMMIT, A REWRITE WOULD REINFORCE MR. TRUMP'S DEMAND THAT NORTH KOREA MUST DISMANTLE ITS NUCLEAR AMBITIONS. MICHAEL, I JUST ASSUME THAT IF GERMANY AND OTHERS IN EUROPE HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE BETWEEN DOING BUSINESS WITH IRAN OR BUSINESS WITH THE UNITED STATES, THERE'S JUST NO QUESTION WHAT THEY WOULD CHOOSE. SO THE PRESIDENT'S HAND HERE FEELS PRETTY STRONG. I THINK SO. LISTEN. LOT OF THE PRESIDENT'S LANGUAGE IS CALCULATED TO MAKING IT CLEAR TO THEM THAT HE'S VERY, VERY SERIOUS. I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S GOTTEN THEM TO THE TABLE SO FAR IN ORDER TO SAY, HEY, LISTEN, LET'S TRY AND FIX SOME OF THESE THINGS THAT OBAMA NEGOTIATED. BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK THEY GOT A PRETTY STRONG MESSAGE. PRESIDENT MACRON AND CHANCELLOR MERKEL THIS WEEK. LISTEN, THE PRESIDENT IS SERIOUS. HE'S GOT TO GET A BETTER DEAL OR HE DOESN'T WANT TO STAY IN THE DEAL FOR A LOT OF REASONS ABOUT THE MIDDLE EAST, BUT ALSO FOR THE MESSAGE IT SENDS TO NORTH KOREA, WHICH IS THAT WE'RE WILLING TO SIGN UP FOR DEALS THAT WE THINK HAVE SERIOUS EMERGENCIES. Dana: WHAT ABOUT THE TRADE ISSUE? I HAVE ONLY GOT ABOUT 40 SECONDS LEFT, BUT I'LL LET YOU HAVE THE FLOOR HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE TRADE ISSUES THAT GERMANY IS CONCERNED ABOUT AND HOW YOU THINK THAT WILL PLAY OUT WITH THE DEADLINE MAY 1ST NEXT WEEK. I THINK THE PRESIDENT WILL END UP EXTENDING THE SORT OF SHELTER HE'S GIVEN THEM TO GIVE THE TWO SIDES MORE TIME TO NEGOTIATE. I DON'T KNOW THAT IT MAKES TOTAL SENSE TO SORT OF SANCTION THEM AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE NEED THEM ON IRAN.
