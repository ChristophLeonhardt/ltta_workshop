1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
Good morning John! I am in sunny Florida.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,980
It's raining pretty hard right now.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,900
I mean, not really THAT hard.

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,440
It is beautiful here. I am loving the, the-

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,420
wetness actually.

6
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,840
It's very dry in Montana.

7
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,460
My skin breaks out. My nose gets all crackly

8
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,340
I like it! I want to be moist!

9
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,000
I maybe don't want to be this moist though

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,300
I may have come out later and film this at a different time

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,680
There's a dog... coming to pee

12
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,280
Quick before it gets all rainy!

13
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,000
Oh no!

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,480
Okay that was bad timing.

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,200
[Thundering]

16
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,200
Okay yeah. No. It's. Okay. Let's go.

17
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,820
I'm back. It's tomorrow.

18
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,440
It was a long storm and now it's very bright back there

19
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,740
But it felt like I committed to this spot, you know?

20
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,820
I'm in Florida for my in-laws' 50th wedding anniversary

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,035
Then I tweeted, "

22
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:47,915
Okay, I'm in Florida on vacation and I need to make a video

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,240
That is fun and quick and not stressful because I need to get back in there [splash] and celebrate.

24
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:52,740
Hello Big Fish!

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,420
So I asked for questions, and I got this from one from Amanda who asks,

26
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,620
"Have you watched the Orin butt wiggle video yet today?"

27
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,500
I haven't. I did watch it yesterday.

28
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,540
But look... I also have the real thing.

29
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,940
Scott Manly says, "What is the expected velocity of an unladen swallow?"

30
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,880
Is it African or European? Scott you didn't say.

31
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,700
Come on!

32
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,400
Grace Helbig said, "Dance."

33
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,140
And I will remind you that I said want not
stressful questions to answer.

34
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,180
Dance, is one, not question.

35
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,800
Two: It's so many people watching. You crazed? Jeez.

36
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,180
What's under your feet right now?

37
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,520
I'm sitting down, and I don't want to touch my camera because it is an extremely precarious set up right now

38
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,980
But here under my feet. Look!

39
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,980
Nothing. Air. Air on both sides.

40
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,040
This is how I sit by the way.

41
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,700
I am very flexible in one, one way, and it's this way.

42
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,380
Hey.

43
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,240
Hi.

44
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:38,960
Hey.

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,640
Hi.

46
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,440
Hey.

47
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,300
Hi.

48
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,220
Hey. [Chuckling]

49
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,860
Is this good video? I have no idea.

50
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,440
What should I embroider on my jacket?

51
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,800
Fancy... dingo.

52
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:48,920
Seems like a good one.

53
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,360
Smell of gasoline. Yes or no?

54
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,720
I mean yes.

55
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,780
Show us your favorite dance move right now.

56
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,520
Come on people!

57
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,860
Who put the ram in the "Rama Lama Ding Dong"?

58
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,520
I bet this is something I can Google.

59
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,960
"Rama Lama Ding Dong"

60
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,800
What's a person who wrote a song's name?

61
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,620
Songwriter?

62
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,700
George Jones Jr.

63
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,080
He put the ram in "Rama Lama Ding Dong."

64
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,919
Somebody should shake his hand...

65
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,039
He's dead.

66
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,595
[Awkward laughing]

67
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,380
He died in 2- 2008.

68
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,580
Wow, they originally called that the "Lama Rama Ding Dong" on the cover of the album

69
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,300
That must have been a bad day when he got it delivered.

70
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,780
He was like, "Come on, you guys!"

71
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,380
I've been workin' so hard, on this, my legacy.

72
00:02:26,485 --> 00:02:29,215
And you're like "Blama Rama" - No! It's Rama Lama!

73
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,820
Yanny or Laurel?

74
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,540
Look. I'm a Yanny.

75
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,860
And I think that it's done with and it's over.

76
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,140
But I'm a Yanny. It happened.

77
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,360
And then I showed Katherine, and she's a Laurel

78
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,460
And she... thought... that I was lying to her... about Yanny.

79
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,780
But it's real, okay?

80
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,520
Yanny's are real!

81
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,620
Please- oh hello, Blue-jay! Aww.

82
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,460
What do you think of the word moi-

83
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,280
I used the word moist earlier in this video yesterday when I was making- making it.

84
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:59,720
What I would like to say to you is, "I think it is word that useful and we should think of it in its usefulness."

85
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,920
But I also really like it.

86
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,500
That was my baby screaming.

87
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,760
Why did he scream?

88
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,440
Cause he was like, "No, dad. Don't talk about the word moist."

89
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,620
Elizabeth asks, "Would eating a carnivorous plant be considered vegan?"

90
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,440
Of course it would.

91
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,600
There's. Wait. WAIT.

92
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,960
No. You're right.

93
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,620
Shoot.

94
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,620
I mean does it come up that often.

95
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,460
Do we need to have rules for everything?

96
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:23,080
Nate asks, "What is your favorite non-serious dance move?"

97
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,220
Raphaelia asks, "Show us your favorite dance move right now!"

98
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,000
Echo asks, "Your best dance moves."

99
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,160
Paulina says, "Recreate Orin's dance."

100
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,700
You guys really want me to dance.

101
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,880
So here's the situation: my baby has a bunch of different dance moves.

102
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,440
So I'm going to do one of them for you.

103
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,060
I'm going to do my currently, -my favorite of Orin's dance moves is

104
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,760
I call it finger guns.

105
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm gonna have to get far enough away from the camera to do it.

106
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,560
[music with vocalizations begins] Okay. Here I am doing fingerguns.

107
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,940
There it is. That's Hank Green doing finger guns.

108
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,060
Now you've all seen it.

109
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,680
I hope that you appreciate it. Hank Green doing finger guns.

110
00:03:52,840 --> 00:00:00,000
John, I will see you on Tuesday.
