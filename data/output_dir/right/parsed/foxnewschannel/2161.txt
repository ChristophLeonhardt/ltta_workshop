BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM
JONG-UN.
GREG IS LIVE IN LONDON WITH THE
DETAILS.
GREG?
>> HI, MELISSA.
THERE IS A FLURRY OF TALK AT
LEAST ABOUT THE POSSIBLE RELEASE
OF THREE AMERICAN CITIZENS WHO
HAVE BEEN HELD FOR THE LAST
SEVERAL MONTHS IN NORTH KOREA OF
THE THREE ARE A BUSINESSMAN
DETAINED IN 2015, AND TWO WHO
WORKED AND TAUGHT AT A CHRISTIAN
CHARITY BACKED UNIVERSITY IN
PYONGYANG.
THEY WERE ARESTED IN 2017.
REPORTS IN THE LAST FEW DAYS HAD

RUDY GUILIANI, WENT A LITTLE BIT

NEGOTIATE PROBABLY ONE OF OUR
MOST HISTORIC AGREEMENTS SINCE
THE OPENING OF CHINA.
AND WE GOT KIM JONG-UN IMPRESSED
ENOUGH TO RELEASE THREE
PRISONERS TODAY.
>> IN FACT, THOSE THREE ARE
STILL IN DETENTION IN NORTH
KOREA.
ACCORDING TO A SENIOR
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL WHO
LATER SPOKE WITH FOX NEWS, IN
THEIR WORDS, SOME WORK STILL

RELEASE.

A LITTLE BIT AHEAD OF EVENTS.
ALL OF THIS HAPPENS OF COURSE
FOLLOWING THE LAST QUICK'S
SUMMIT BETWEEN NORTH -- LAST
WEEK'S SUMMIT BETWEEN NORTH AND
SOUTH KOREA ALONG THE DMZ WE
REPORTED ON.
AND AHEAD OF THE PLANNED SUMMIT,
THE BIG ONE, BETWEEN KIM
JONG-UN.
THAT IS SAID TO BE HAPPENING
EARLY JUNE.
ANALYSTS SAY ANY RELEASE OF THE
AMERICANS PRIOR TO THAT WOULD BE
