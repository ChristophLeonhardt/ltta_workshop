well it's Valentine's Day and that seems like a good time for our monthly visit to our favorite website everyday feminism everyday feminism is a place where straight men can go to experience the true joy of feminism which is making fun of feminism it's also a place where women can go if they're unhappy angry confused and perpetually dissatisfied and they want to be with other women like themselves today on everyday feminism we find a post entitled nine fantastic ways to be a practicing feminist with your partner and you know just how fantastic it's going to be because it's illustrated with a picture of a happy gay Eurasian man washing dishes I'm not sure what that's about but I know if a happy gay Eurasian man would come over to my house and wash dishes that would be fantastic and when he's done maybe he could take out the trash the post is written by Tory truesight no really that's her name I swear and Tory truesight explains that she's a lesbian who enjoys dating masculine women so she knows a lot about being with men because her friends tell her about it and it sounds very difficult I'm not making any of this up so Tory truesight asks what does feminist feminism look like in a relationship with a man which of course is a difficult question to answer since it would involve finding a man who is in a relationship with a feminist and is able to stop sobbing long enough to explain what it's like but as a lesbian who dates masculine women Tory truesight offers the following nine guidelines to straight men for how to be in a relationship with a feminist number one continually ask for consent Tory truesight writes and this is a direct quote so help me I've lived in a tragic bind for the last decade which is that I'm a lesbian who loves breasts but I'm attracted to masculine women who don't enjoy their breasts being touched unquote so in that situation make sure to continually ask for consent before sneaking out the back door and never going home again number two actually listen actually I don't know what the section said because I wasn't paying attention number three respect your partner's autonomy over their body happily if your partner can be described by the possessive adjectives there it's possible she has more than one body and you can respect her autonomy over one of them while going to town with the others until the first one is ready to go number four for splits let us work in a way that works for everyone this sentence has no rational meaning well there are five more fantastic ways to be a feminist with your partner in the article nine fantastic ways to be a feminist with your partner but if you followed the fantastic advice in the article so far you probably no longer have a partner and are now miserable lonely bitter and angry so

got itself a scalp and they are happy Michael Flynn the National Security Advisor resigned he had what had he done it's kind of quick good question what had he done he had talked to the Russians before he took office to the Russian ambassador before he took office he had mentioned talked about the sanctions that Obama had put on the Russians for theoretically tampering with the election you know who cares that he did this but he did but then he lied to officials about it Mike Pence included and pence went on TV and defended him and then felt kind of wrong-footed and now it came to light it was all of this was leaked to the press so the story that the press is telling now is that the White House is in complete chaos right it's this is a complete chaos and everything is just falling apart and this this president will never accomplish anything just like he never won the nomination and he would never win the presidency so now he's never going to be able to accomplish anything here's the Washington Post upheaval upheaval is now standard operating procedure in the White House once dismissed his growing pains three weeks ago growing pains the chaos that was one of Donald Trump's trademarks and business and campaigning now threatens to plague his presidency according to interviews with a dozen White House officials and other Republicans just to compare I just just for fun to compare the way they treated Obama when he couldn't get anything done he first got into the White House right here's Terry Moran from ABC News interviewing Obama listen to the difference in tone who's President you got no honeymoon not a single Republican vote in the house on your first major piece of legislation a big honeymoon from the American people but what happened coming into the presidency maybe you were too nice if if I'm a Republican senator or Republican congressman and I think you're a very nice guy but maybe I don't have enough reason to fear you Donald you know president the Donald you're just too nice you know why didn't you get a honeymoon oh yeah because we're attacking you every day now remember so they so the press is happy they feel like that here's a New York Times reporter yesterday you know what I'm feeling pretty good about myself right now okay maybe that wasn't really a New York Times reporter but maybe it was for all I know it could well have been all right so you know they did give the impression of chaos Kellyanne Conway went out and said that Flynn had the complete confidence of the President and then within 45 minutes Sean Spicer was saying not so much and within another hour you know Flynn was gone so Matt Lauer has Kellyanne and he's taken her to pieces here's the first cut yesterday afternoon on MSNBC you said that Michael Flynn enjoyed the full confidence of the President John Spicer later said the president was evaluating the situation and then Michael Flynn resigns overnight were you out of the loop on this no not at all both were true the president is very loyal he's a very loyal person and by night send Mike was best to resign he knew he'd become a lightning rod and and he made that decision so had he resigned the president would continue with him as national security advisor even though he misled the vice president and the administration about my intents of that call that fact is what became unsustainable actually I think misleading the vice president really was the key here and I spoke with the president this morning he asked me to to speak on his behalf and and to reiterate that Mike Flynn had resigned he decided that he that the situation had become unsustainable for him so there's you know this happens every time somebody gets the can basically in politics every time somebody comes out before head and says the president has a hundred percent you know confidence in this man and then the trap door opens underneath him and he's gone you know so the big question the question that the press is asking is why did this take so long if the FBI and the intelligence community had warned the Justice Department had warned the president that he might be blackmailed because he had said things to the Russians and then had not been honest about what he said although that seems really really far out there that he would that that would get him blackmailed but okay if he knew about it why didn't he fire him so here's the exchange where Matt Lauer tries to say that this proves that he was acting for Trump he was contacting the Russians for Trump and it was all you know basically the administrator I mean what this is about you let's remember these sanctions that Obama lowered on them were a political move in the first place they were just to show just to delegitimize the presidency by saying that the Russians had somehow skewed the election which we now know is is untrue we now know that people did not vote according to things that the Russians did that really didn't happen so this whole thing with the sanctions was a political setup to begin with so it's not like a real thing you know I mean it's so he's talking about it so what the big conspiracy would be I don't know but Matt Lauer feels that he's on the trail of something here is you're starting to make me think that perhaps general Kelly was not freelancing during that call when he talked about or hinted I'm sorry general Flynn that that he wasn't freelancing during that call that in fact he may have been making that call on behalf of the administration or the Inc humming administration would that be accurate no that's it would be mistakes he conclude that remember in the end it was misleading the vice president that made the situation unsustainable which the White House knew about last month and yet yesterday you went on the air and said that General Flint had the complete and full confidence of the President and general Flynn decided that he should resign last night the president accepted that resignation but the president is very loyal and he's been carrying forward with his entire team very effectively frankly and at this stage he accepted the resignation and he's moving on you know one of the things is I mean I don't I don't know what the sequence of events was no one else does either except for Trump and maybe the few people who were around him so one of the things I've noticed about commentaries people speculating and the speculation becomes the fact and people just act as if they're crazy speculations or what actually happened I mean I can imagine I can imagine Trump stay you know Trump is a loyal guy he does stick with people right down to the end I can imagine Trump trying to stick with this guy becoming impossible for pence to work with him I think the Trump has a lot of a lot of investment in Pence because I think that he knows that pence is his connection to Congress he knows he's not gonna get anything he doesn't know how to deal with you know the Senate in the house and he knows he's not gonna get anything done he knows that pence gives him respect he would wouldn't otherwise have and there was a lot of noise about the kind of hires that Flynn was making so so maybe Flynn wasn't doing that good a job and he just eventually said you know this has got it this has got to happen I don't know I do not know what happened but but here's the thing there's all this talk about the Logan Act and this is trash okay because the Logan Act essentially says that private citizens are not allowed to negotiate with countries that we're at odds with basically and no one's ever been for one person was once indicted on it no one's ever been prosecuted on it ever no one's ever been prosecuted on and if they were it they it would be tossed out on First Amendment grounds I mean even talk to anybody you want you know and what what difference does it make if I go talk to the Russian ambassador that's not going to do anything to the country I mean it's it's a ridiculous thing there's no reason why an incoming administration shouldn't be talking to him it's absurd I mean this part of it is absurd that he violated he violated some kind of criminality but but that is part of what the left is playing is selling the best one this was just before the resignation was our old friend Keith Olbermann which I have to play because it's just too hilarious where he now believes the entire government I love this guy he's like he's like the entertain he's like the clown the gesture of the court of Donald Trump you know it's like Donald and then the guy comes out with the little bells on his hat and all this stuff Vicki Keith Oberman believes now the entire country has been taken over by the Russians I call for the immediate indictment of Michael Thomas Flynn on charges of and his immediate arrest on suspicion of violations of the Logan Act I call for his immediate suspension resignation or dismissal as the national security advisor to the President of the United States of America I call for the immediate investigation of whether his relationship with the Russian government is limited to activities covered by the Logan Act or if he is acting as an agent of the Russian government or as in the past acting as a paid employee of companies affiliated with the Russian government I call for senators Graham and McCain and any remaining patriotic Americans on the Republican Senatorial roster if any there yet be to fulfill their promise of weeks ago to immediately conduct a full open and limitless investigation into Russian hacking during the election into Russian coordination with the Republican presidential campaign during the election and into the contact between the Russians and the transition team between the time of the election and the time of the inauguration just don't panic sorry and the Russians are coming the Russians are coming so the government is taken over by the Russians we violated the Logan act something terrible they owe that in the White House's and chaos listen Trump has a chaotic style you know the The Wall Street Journal wrote a piece today kind of describing what happens is that he likes there to be any time there's a president the his inner circle divides into power centers okay that just happens with any group it's gonna with any group and usually the chief of staff in this case Reince Priebus governs kind of guides everybody in you can go in now and you can go in then you know kind of puts people together so it all makes sense and that doesn't seem to be happening yet after three weeks with this guy who was never a politician before the Wall Street Journal writes vice-president Mike Pence ran the transition and has a say in personnel among other things strategist Steven Bannon and his policy made Steven Miller share mr. Trump's fondness for shocking the beltway Busey and wrote the botched executive order on immigration son-in-law Jared Kushner appears to play on any issue he wants Kellyanne Conway is a presidential favorite who takes the media Spears on the cable shows Gary Cohn runs the National Economic Council was already muscling now competing voices on taxes and finance and block supply siders steve moore and larry cudlow from senior White House jobs then there's Reince Priebus the nominal chief of staff who was supposed to impose order on the joint but hasn't been given the power to do so and now they're starting to blame him you're starting to hear all this stuff about Reince Priebus and maybe we're gonna get rid of Reince Priebus and also so there is there's a little bit of disorder at the White House and you know that's that is part of the Trump style part of the Trump style is like this kind of creative destruction whether this is going to be a huge problem or not is absolutely beyond our our Ken is impossible to know all we do know is that all the same people who are telling us the Trump can't succeed and the Trump can't do anything with the same people telling us he couldn't get elected saying people telling us he couldn't get nominated so there's much to say I have something really important to say about this but unfortunately I got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube so you got to come over to the Daily wire comm and hear the rest you can watch if you subscribe and if you subscribe you can be in the mailbag tomorrow all your problems solved
