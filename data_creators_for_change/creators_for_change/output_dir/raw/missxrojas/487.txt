00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,289
from the subject which is of course

10
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:18,869
Harry Potter this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is your token Harry</font>

Potter video from my channel Harry

12
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,800
Potter has been an influence in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my life</font>

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,710
since<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was 6 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> old I still can't</font>

14
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,859
find the<font color="#CCCCCC"> words to talk about just</font>

15
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly what he's done in my life</font>

16
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,910
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's done so much this little</font>

17
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,649
boy wizard with spectacles or rather do

18
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,719
roaring has done so much by writing this

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,219
book<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this little boy wizard with</font>

20
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,050
spectacles it's been really peculiar

21
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,550
actually over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the flat last couple of</font>

22
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,910
days I was interviewed by USA Today and

23
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,100
your lines<font color="#E5E5E5"> ants a bitch column they were</font>

24
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,600
asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> me of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> course you know what's the</font>

25
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">best thing I butch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was giving you or</font>

26
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,910
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is gonna happen or why is</font>

27
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,710
it that people love Harry Potter as

28
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,039
always when I talk about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't</font>

29
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:00,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">articulate myself because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just like I</font>

30
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,760
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> describe it it's done too much</font>

31
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,979
it's too much of a phenomenon and that

32
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,110
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right word I mean I really</font>

33
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,060
didn't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gym early and Oprah</font>

34
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,950
interview for many reasons mainly

35
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,390
because it seemed to all revolve around

36
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,580
money but I think the most interesting

37
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,560
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that came out of that was rolling</font>

38
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,890
saying that she had learned not to chase

39
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,470
the phenomenon that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the phenomenon</font>

40
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,780
happened and it was amazing and that

41
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,549
she'll treasure that but that's not

42
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:29,189
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be striving for all the time</font>

43
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,990
and she gave the example of Michael

44
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,090
Jackson and thriller and that he was

45
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,759
always chasing that experience after

46
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,200
that but that was like that was an

47
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,610
exceptional time I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we have to</font>

48
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember that as well me and my friends</font>

49
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,630
tend to get quite melodramatic when we

50
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,040
leave our friends behind because we

51
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,490
normally see each other maybe three or

52
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,590
four<font color="#CCCCCC"> days a year sometimes a little bit</font>

53
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">more and it's sad because you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

54
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">love these people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spend more</font>

55
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,130
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> with them and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of post</font>

56
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,380
Potter depression oh man will<font color="#E5E5E5"> never have</font>

57
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,060
this again this was such a defining

58
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,860
moment in our lives and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how lucky are we</font>

59
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,770
that these books to find our childhood

60
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,920
rather than anything

61
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,600
else to<font color="#E5E5E5"> finding our childhood really</font>

62
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,520
this isn'ta bastard<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twilight honestly</font>

63
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">like you know I don't like twilight with</font>

64
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,060
this I promise you is it to bash

65
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">Twilight oh do you wonder what I would</font>

66
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">have been like if I read twilight kind</font>

67
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,959
of in place of harry potter almost cuz i

68
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:21,010
started reading here<font color="#E5E5E5"> i come to when I</font>

69
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,050
was six so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would have started</font>

70
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,420
Twilight when I was like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 or something</font>

71
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,980
something younger than I should have I

72
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,390
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would have made a very</font>

73
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,880
different person I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> very much shaped by</font>

74
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,800
the books<font color="#E5E5E5"> I read we do need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hold on</font>

75
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,360
to the idea that this whole experience

76
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,010
is an exception it's something

77
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,780
exceptional phenomenal and of course we

78
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,310
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> celebrate that but we shouldn't</font>

79
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,340
spend our lives chasing after all of

80
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,350
that that happened or looking for

81
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,090
something else to replace<font color="#CCCCCC"> that neither</font>

82
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,910
should I hold it as the central part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

83
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,140
my life because<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the amazing</font>

84
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,400
things about<font color="#E5E5E5"> high cultures that it's</font>

85
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,620
permeated so much of my life mainly

86
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">through the friend that's introduced me</font>

87
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,620
to you and other things we were

88
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,690
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and other experiences that</font>

89
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,069
we've had together that aren't so

00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:01,810
directly linked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to harry potter but i do</font>

91
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,760
except that now it's not going to be

92
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,370
essential as it has been for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past 10</font>
