YOU THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 15 DAYS FROM ELECTION DAY. JOINING US NOW AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK. TRUMP THE BLUE COLLAR PRESIDENT. ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI. I LOOK THE PARTY OF NO CONSTITUTION ORDER IN THE KAVANAUGH HEARINGS. NO PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE. SANCTUARY CITY AND ELIMINATING ICE. A PARTY THAT WON'T CONDEMN THE MOB THAT SAYS THE LEADERS SAYING CONFRONT THEM. WHY DO THEY EVEN HAVE A SHOT IN 15 DAYS IS THE REAL QUESTION? IT'S BECAUSE OF THE MEDIA PROBABLY. THAT COULD BE ONE. MANY REASONS. THE PRESIDENT ON A NIGHT LIKE TONIGHT. A RESOUNDING RALLY. EVERY NIGHT WHEN THE PRESIDENT IS OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN, HE IS PUTTING THEM DEEP IN THEIR OWN ZONE. THE DEMOCRATS ARE BACKED UP TO THEIR GOAL LINE. HE IS TERRIFIC AT THAT. IT'S WAY TIGHTER. THE BEST CLIP YOU SHOWED WAS THE BERNIE SANDERS CLIP SAYING THIS IS TIGHTER THAN EVER BEFORE. THE MOST UNUSUAL PRESIDENCY EVER. MOST PEOPLE PREDICT THAT THE HOUSE AND SO FAR GOES TO THE OTHER SIDE. THE PRESIDENT IS DEMONSTRATING HE CAN GET THE VOTER TURNOUT EVEN IN A MID-TERM ELECTION. I THINK IT WILL BE CLOSE. YOU WON'T BE SURPRISED. OUR FRIENDS WON'T BE SURPRISED. RUSH LIMBAUGH WON'T BE SURPRISED IF THE DEMOCRATS DON'T GET THE BLUE WAVE. Sean: I AM LESS WORRIED ABOUT THE SENATE. IF RICK SCOTT CAN WIN AS A SENATE CANDIDATE IN FLORIDA AND RON DESANTIS IS GOVERNOR AND HEIDI HEITKAMP IS TOAST IN NORTH CAROLINA. THEN YOU HAVE JOHN TESTER IN THE FIGHT OF HIS LIFE. HE COULD LOSE IN MONTANA. I HOPE THE PEOPLE IN INDIANA REJECT THE LIBERTARIAN SO THEN JOE IS TOAST. IT'S THE HOUSE I AM WORRIED ABOUT. PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH 15 DAYS. THAT'S A LOT OF TIME ON THE CLOCK TO GET HIS MESSAGE OUT. LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO US DURING THE CAMPAIGN. EVERYBODY COUNTED US OUT AFTER THE ACCESS HOLLYWOOD TAPE AND WHAM HE IS THE 45th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THAT WAS ONLY 30 DAYS. 15 DAYS, THAT'S A MOOCH AND A HALF. Sean: . I WANT TO APPLAUD YOU. YOU CAPTURED SOMETHING IN YOUR BOOK. IT'S ON AMAZON.COM. TRUMP THE BLUE COLLAR PRESIDENT. THE PEOPLE HE IS HELPING ARE THE FORGOTTEN MEN AND WOMEN. THAT'S SCARAMUCCI AND "HANNITY." ABSOLUTELY. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO LOVE THE GUY. THEY ARE POSITIVE. THE MEDIA CAN SAY WHATEVER THEY WANT. THE MORE MEDIA NONSENSE THROWN AT THE PRESIDENT, THE MORE PEOPLE ARE LIKE THE SCARAMUCCIs. LIBERALS DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT MESSAGE. THEY TALK OVER YOU. THAT'S FINE. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS OF WRITING A BOOK LIKE THIS, IF THE LIBERALS READ IT THEY WILL SEE THE PRESIDENT'S PLAYBOOK. I AM A HUGE SUPPORTER. I WANTED TO EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE WHY HE WON FROM MY VANTAGE POINT. Sean: I HAVE TO RUN. CONGRATS.
