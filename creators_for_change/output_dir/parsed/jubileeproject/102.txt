people see the end result which is a
shiny red airplane they go that's nice
you know like that's that's cool but
like it's more to me than I it's the
reflection everything I had to do to
turn them
growing up for me was like I did have
energy but I don't know where to put it
the sky surfing down
so I got school up I was put special and
I didn't like I just felt like like
nobody nobody believed like I was
capable of anything it was just like
being in timeout I would just sit there
and not really do a lot
when you become like unconfident you
don't know how to how to recover from
that I don't have a really good way of
being like other people
I was just bullied enough forties to
where I thought I am weird I was really
Restless at the school like the
institution just as it wasn't speaking
to me at all
I really needed to find something that I
was passionate about now you found it
right at the right time dad left it over
the office that I'm picking you up don't
take the bus and he picked me up from
school that day and there was a leak in
a hangar and we had to fix some
sheetrock even from the day my dad gave
me that note in school like that was the
beginning like of the chain that changes
your life and you never know what it is
until you like look back
first time I came to the airport and saw
that airplane I saw something I want to
be involved in for the rest of my life
and at that point I was like whatever it
takes
I met Mack Nguyen probably the most
influential force of my life and max
showed me a couple things that he was
working on and I was actually kind of
really interested I'll do all this up
works like this and this is how this
works I was placing the blocks for so
long and now coming out to this airport
I felt like I was out of that box Mac
put me on these floats that need to be
drilled apart so there was like couple
thousand rivets nine to start drilling
out of each one
and then having somebody believe in me
it's Berkeley excite know who were
working on airplanes now you know I'm 14
we're working on airplanes and he's
expecting me to do a good job they know
they're not gonna be perfect at the time
but I kept trying really hard and you
recognized that I started using my
special at hours reading like grounds
for books
everything I didn't learn in algebra
ended up learning in metal shop
now therefore the contrast like school
doesn't care and then back and the
people the airport like care like they
believed in me and I was kind of
addicted to it I just kept coming here
and eventually they start paying me I
knew as a freshman at least gonna be a
pilot
I wasn't have an airplane I didn't know
exactly how I was gonna do it but this
was a start
your people say like if you want
something you have to want it more than
you want to breathe wanting that
airplane there was no option to quit on
because I was identifying with that
when I was in the hunt for the Cessna
172 Artie said you should get a project
my dad called me said that his boss knew
where one was and Max's you just you got
to buy that one max likes pizzas iced
tea and it's dripping out of his like
white beerus okay dad no I guess I guess
we're buying it
when we found the plane it was green and
white somebody had carved their name
into it so this old banged-up fuselage
without any wings on or anything and it
was it was a wreck but like it had the
potential it was excited I mean I was
only 15 and I had pie now and an
airplane
yeah sure can fly but didn't matter it
still said I owned an airplane in the
registry so I owned one
when I was younger is definitely more
inpatient and wanted to get things
wanted do you like the action I'm
getting like get in it and get things
done and kick ass
people thought like oh we bought an
airplane he'll get bored of it
eventually I couldn't imagine not
finishing it I would work like 10 hours
a day and I started building this plane
up and things we're they look pretty
good but nothing ever really goes
according to plan I got a lot of help
today going on Sam I just wish you knew
what I even did are a hundred bucks
so that could buy the screws
I did some construction jobs I dug
ditches I worked in a refinery to pay
for the rent on the hangar
I even spent months of an Alaska fishing
for salmon
I just like six years just to earn as
much as I could
I was out in these storms that are
sometimes 12-foot waves
30-knot winds at just under three am
tall
11 a.m. and then again from 3 p.m. to 11
p.m. you learn how to like sleep outside
like lean against a warm exhaust and
sleep outside you put on
try to like channel that warm air coming
out of the manifold that like get night
foxy air anything
phishing taught me a lot no matter what
when it's time to fish time to fish you
don't quit
building the plane itself wasn't the
hard part of it the hardest thing has
been you know keeping motivated through
the entire process and like absolutely
not taking no for an answer
and doing whatever it takes to really
get that done
I couldn't imagine not finishing it
I could probably go over every part and
just tell you like the experience of
building just that or what happened to
get that part I was laying with a
learning disability but by 21 I became a
certified mechanic I finished college
seven and eight quarters early I'm
private pilot and I build my own
airplane
I didn't let what anybody else thought
of me dictate what I do I doubt myself
it's not uncommon for me to doubt myself
but then I see how far the planes coming
and how much progress had maintenance
and there's no way I can go back on that
if you want something bad enough we
truly want something bad enough then you
have to make the sacrifices
I could buy steak but I buy airplane
parts instead
this is just the any of this what's next
for me is to have the experience of
flying this airplane every state and
that's really important to me because I
know that there's a lot more in this
country to see and the plane is the
perfect way to do that
