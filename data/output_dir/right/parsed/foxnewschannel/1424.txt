BILLS ONTO THE FLOOR, AND 213
MEMBERS HAVE SIGNED ON SO FAR.
ED.
>>  CHAD, THANKS FOR THAT
REPORT.
LET'S TALK TO CONGRESSMAN JEFF
DENHAM.
HE'S KIND ENOUGH TO JOIN US
LIVE, GIVE US THE INSIDE SCOOP
OF WHERE THIS IMMIGRATION DEBATE
STANDS.
SOMETIMES YOU HEAR SOMETHING
THAT JUST STOPS YOU IN YOUR
TRACKS.
NANCY PELOSI SAYING YOUR EFFORT
IS TO, "MAKE AMERICA WHITE
AGAIN.
SGLILT
SGLIL
"
>>YEAH, DISAPPOINTING TO HEAR.
WE'VE GOT TO GET SOMETHING DONE.
THERE WERE MANY PROMISES MADE
LAST YEAR TO BRING UP A BILL.
THERE WAS CERTAINLY A DEADLINE
THAT THE PRESIDENT IMPOSED.
AND CONGRESS FAILED TO ACT.
WE NEED BORDER SECURITY AND WE
NEED TO FIX THIS ISSUE WITH
DREAMERS, HAVE A PERMANENT FIX.
WE ARE WORKING TO DO BOTH.
>>  LET'S GET OUR VIEWERS INSIDE
THE HUDDLE, IF YOU WILL.
BASICALLY, AS CHAD EXPLAINED, IF
YOU CAN GET 218 PEOPLE TO SIGN
ONTO THIS, WHAT HAPPENS?
>>  SO 218 WILL FORCE A VOTE.
I'VE GOT 218.
I'VE ALWAYS HAD 218.
THERE HAS BEEN A PLAN IN PLACE.
BUT REALLY THIS WAS SET UP AS A
RULE INITIALLY TO SHOW HOW MANY
REPUBLICANS WE COULD HAVE IN THE
HOUSE AND HOW MUCH SUPPORT TO
REALLY GIVE THE SPEAKER --
EMPOWER THE SPEAKER TO BRING
SOMETHING UP.
WE DIDN'T DO THAT, SO WE DID THE
DISCHARGE.
AND NOW WE'RE HAVING A VERY
PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION WITH THE
FREEDOM CAUCUS AND HOUSE
LEADERSHIP TO HOPEFULLY COME TO
A SOLUTION AS SOON AS WE GET
BACK.
BUT WE HAVE THIS DISCHARGE
PETITION THAT WILL BRING UP FOUR
DIFFERENT BILLS.
THE GOODLATTE BILL -- HE
DESERVES A VOTE.
THE PRESIDENT DESERVES A VOTE.
THAT'S WHY PAUL RYAN HAS HIS OWN
BILL IN THIS.
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE THEIR CLEAN
DREAM ACT.
AND THEN WE HAVE THE USA ACT.
>>  SO WE UNDERSTAND THE
PROCESS.
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS SOME OF
YOUR FELLOW REPUBLICANS ARE
SAYING THAT WHAT MAY END UP
HAVING IS MOST VOTES WILL GO TO
SAY THE DEMOCRATIC DREAM ACT.
BARACK OBAMA WENT AROUND TO
EVERYBODY AND UNILATERALLY
DECIDED THAT THE CHILDREN OF
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS THAT ARE HERE
IN THE UNITED STATES, UNION LAT
-- UNILATERALLY HE DECIDED THEY
COULD STAY HERE.
YOU'LL WIND UP WITHOUT BORDER
SECURITY BUT WITH MAKING DACA
CODIFIED INTO LAW.
>>  CERTAINLY, IT'S
DISAPPOINTING TO HEAR THIS TYPE
OF RHETORIC WHEN THE GOD  --
GOODLATTE BILL IS AN EXTENSION
OF WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA DID.
I WAS AGAINST THAT EXECUTIVE
ORDER.
I THINK CONGRESS HAS TO DO ITS
JOB.
BUT IN A BIPARTISAN BILL, WE ARE
GOING TO ACTUALLY HAVE A BORDER
SECURITY PIECE, CYBERSECURITY,
AND DEAL WITH THE CHAIN
MIGRATION THROUGH MORE JUDGES SO
WE HAVE DUE PROCESS VERY
QUICKLY.
THE REAL DEBATE IS DO
REPUBLICANS ACTUALLY WANT TO
GIVE A PERMANENT FIX FOR
DREAMERS?
IF THEY DO A 10 TO 12-YEAR
PROCESS, SHOULD THEY BE ABLE TO
GET CITIZENSHIP?
>>  SO BOTTOM LINE, WILL THE
WALL BE INCLUDED?
THE PRESIDENT SAID IF THERE'S
NOT FUNDING FOR A REAL WALL,
SOMETHING SUBSTANTIAL, HE'S NOT
GOING TO SIGN IT INTO LAW.
EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING WON'T
MATTER.
HE WON'T SIGN IT INTO LAW.
WILL THE FINAL PRODUCT HAVE
FUNDING FOR THE WALL?
>>  ABSOLUTELY.
THE FINAL PRODUCT WILL NOT ONLY
HAVE BORDER SECURITY MONEY IN IT
FOR THE WALL, BUT IT WILL HAVE A
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT.
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE'LL GET A
FIX ON THIS.
AND ULTIMATELY THIS IS NOT JUST
FOR REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS.
THIS IS ACTUALLY FOR AMERICANS
TO FIND AN AMERICAN SOLUTION.
THAT MEANS SIGNING IT INTO LAW.
WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE
PRESIDENT TO HAVE A BILL HE'LL
