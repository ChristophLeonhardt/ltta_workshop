Co cinema is the ultimate celebration of a film we create a world which is inspired by a movie in this case it's really Scott's Blade Runner where we have recreated the City of LA with all its back streets and stories and it's characters are populated and audience come and interact with the various characters within the story of the film and then they sit down in the watch movie and as they watch the movie the film comes to life around so it's really a participatory experience for the audience where they get to let loose in their favorite film I've just come out of secret cinemas Bladerunner production at undisclosed location in London it's absolutely mind-blowing experience for any movie lover and throughout the way I fought with gangs I've had to infiltrate information but of course I can't say too much because it is called secret cinema well for a reason so I guess you'll just have you you
