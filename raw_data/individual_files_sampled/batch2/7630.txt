you're about to watch a free clip of old school if you like it wait till you see the whole episode all the episodes in their entirety are available for members become a member by going to TYT calm /join jankura ben mankiewicz old school old school so lots of discuss tonight and there's something new on old school that I have to explain right now programming notes are always super fun so first of all of course we're sponsored by shop TYT dot-com where you will not be able to find this t-shirt okay because this happening on that t-shirt that t-shirt is if you remember the sword in the darkness the Watchers on the wall okay so that's from the last drive we did well we have a new membership drive mmm-hmm so people who gave in the last Drive got this t-shirt and we said they'd never come back and it didn't come back okay so we're not playing around you understand what I'm saying so if we do shirt in this Drive understand that it would be a different t-shirt it'll be different and you will never get a chance to buy it again now it doesn't even exist yet so and probably one of you guys will draw it as as was the case with this one of your drug and and so I'm gonna tell you about the membership drive in a second but whenever I see anybody in this shirt I know that they in a sense help build a company so one of the drives we build the studio another one we hired reporters and this one is to try to get to a hundred thousand members so that we are an immovable Rock and that we fight for progressives and especially because 2020 is coming I think we disagree it's working 2018 it's been pushed back it has went well okay I had the three eyed Raven did not tell me that yeah it's like I think 2023 is it yeah yeah well what was 2023 well you know what they say that will now be 20 2006 right well what they say hindsight is 20/20 three that's right they say that they didn't say that yeah uh so I have really understood the head expression didn't tell man oh yeah that's right it seemed a little weird until now okay so we have a lot of fun things on the show we're gonna in a minute discuss of course what is the least American season of the four seasons which one is the least American it actually hides it well that's a good answer for a different question but it turns out there is actually a clear answer and we'll see if banking it that clear answer we might have to dip into Trump because see again is added in maniacal ways just before this show began but before I get into any of that so I want to explain we have gone public and private a piece of tape before we yeah okay this is the kind of stuff that happens on old school so we have changed our minds approximately seventy eight times on whether any portion of this show is going to be public it's usually four members that members get it live and a lot of you are watching now and notice that we started late as usual so that's also old-school tradition but we're now putting up basically the first half hour for free on YouTube it's not just a half an hour show it's about an hour and a half show and members get the whole show and you'll already have seen that in the pre-roll to this where I'm wearing a suit and all that stuff but I just wanted you guys to know both the folks that are watching and that are not members and the members that from now on we'll be putting up the first half an hour or so on YouTube on the weekends ok so a lot of you are watching now that are not members so the first half hour of old school we've had so many conversations about what to do with old school I'm sorry actually I haven't had any I like finding out with the rest of you so the first half hour which is seldom the best half hour will be made free it is what it is for example the first couple of minutes here useless good pretty much pretty much a waste of time requests for tape chewing some food yeah and over some membership rules we eat between the shows ok anyways lastly on this we're gonna put up a number here that is relevant to the members cuz they're the only ones watching live because we've been trying to get to 29,000 today 29,000 our membership drive those of you are not members will be seeing this days later but this will be a fun for oh no it's not public anyway there won't be any fun part for you guys we do keep it real on old-school and are we going to talk about the thing on my lip yes that's another thing we're gonna discuss in a little it was only a few weeks ago that we talked about the thing on my lip that's right man there's a lot of lip talk a lot of loose lips summer oh no 17 heart ship is sinking all right so membership drive update for the day we're trying to get the 29,000 did we get there can I see the number but that wait a minute I think I actually have it not what I intended all right so 29,000 47 we did reach 29,000 Anna's is 30,000 she says we had either 30,000 she said it by the first thing which is impossible this is the second day and 29,000 was impossible but we got it's a good start oh it's an amazing start yeah so thank you to all who are like of 1,000 yesterday right yeah with 1,500 no no it's it's been an amazing couple thank you to all of you guys and if you if you're not already member make progress of media possible and get this fun show and by the way the archives for the old school goes back years you're gonna love those archives we're now wait I can I can curse this will have to be bleeped out later we're not around okay what does that bleed out on a version that do you reverse your three half-hour yeah and pluses in other words who cares super boring anyway for the members you get all the curses too so that's fun tea y-t-dot-com /join alright let's move on let's move on so we got Trump I got a I have there's so many wonderful things today also a secret state among the 50 states that were you're gonna go no nobody wants to live there wait a minute should people live there so that's coming up in a little bit as well okay so by the way in old school we measure time and different metrics so when I say a little bit I probably mean an hour and 15 minutes from now okay just giving everybody a heads up since we're starting something new today all right so without further ado let's see if you can guess the most most unamerican season well to be fair it's by default there's nothing particularly unamerican about it it just loses to the other seasons is this this is in your opinion and I don't mean to say obviously there's no conversation that I like less I had wanted to Telluride Film Festival then when you say an opinion as fact and someone joins it retorts that hey man it's just opinion everyone's entitled to an opinion I'm like hey man you just made this a very uninteresting conversation I got it everyone's entitled an opinion that's not news it's only interesting if you state your opinion as fact as if it's a bold declaration look if we get to hundreds of members I should make my first promise now we will start a show called strong opinions JQ wrong opinion but it would fill the blank by rachel handled so so is this your this is your take your declaration essentially yeah I mean but you're stating the most obvious things in the world I just wondered if like it was read somewhere or was sort of a group think like did people know no one outside of me but but it is obvious yeah I think it is obvious I'm not quite there yet although I am certainly influenced by whether you use the term fall or autumn because I think we use the term autumn then that is in the running but let's go with fall okay and so I don't think it could be fall because fall is a I think a time that you would think it's just yes I do the most glorious time football begins it's a it's a new beginning they you can tell me the year starts in January that's nonsense the year starts in the fall okay so far Dana named a hundred percent correct I feel like in a old school episode three and a half years ago we already had this conversation that one's easy that's a layup fall is the most American season unless you call it autumn in which case and then we got to read it order every yeah in case you said welcome to America and you're gonna call it fall and we call football the sport where we actually hit each other that's right and not kick the ball around until we get to a one-nil result on the pitch that's right okay um okay so fall is not the most unamerican right that's not I don't think you could argue that summer is a non American season because it's F in summer summer get out in summer you look for it you have some great new greatest experience in summer either travel with your family traveling with your friends some are loved there's just something about summer that even now at our advanced age like my daughter went to started kindergarten today today is her first day at real school when it was an experience it was the end of summer so even her summer which is not the same as my summer because she doesn't have anything to do and still manages to complain and because you just said how great were those summers I don't think you can call summer unamerican ding-ding-ding continue to be 100 percent right I believe the last time we played this game summer came in 2nd not really a closed closed site but there was a discussion that's a discussion because 4th of July is in the summer I mean it doesn't get more American than that right there's a lot of flags around here day summer Memorial Day technically not summer but summer yeah Labor Day technically summer but not summer so it's kind of balances it that's true that's Labor Day technically fall Memorial Day I mean Labor Day essentially fall Memorial Day essentially so right also in in the camp for summer coming in number two hot dogs I'll touch your barbecues a barbecues no clearly the second most American sees vacation yeah no nobody look if you haven't agreed so far there's something wrong with you well you might think you're American but you're not so that we're down to a winter and spring yes we are see now and if you see how it's gonna become ok uh-huh it's tricky because winter has a Christmas or Hanukkah or whatever else thing you want to sell that's family company elves are great yeah saying that anything in these other times there aren't American moments in whatever is the most unamerican season absolutely is the boss by default that's right that's right that's what you did say that so uh I because especially for those of us who grew up back east when spring comes you sense dare I say it some degree of hope so that we've come out of a winter of shirt days and short days blow right yeah went night-night time at 4:42 that doesn't interest anybody and it's just too cold in the morning and so when spring comes and you get those first day out it's 52 degrees today and sunny something's happening something is happening and for me the baseball they go to spring training you sense there's a so I but then there are allergies because I like it could be the cup in front of you I like winter I like the snow I like the cold I don't but I like the cold but I don't see how the emergence of Sun and the emergence of a of a possibility of a nine month run of American greatness I think spring is more American than winter and I will say that winter is the most American by default of all the seasons yeah see this is where the great American controversy begins uh-huh okay for those of you who use the word autumn it is a controversy because I had an attack and neck between winter is red clearly it sa okay yeah but I kept thinking of what is American about spring and I was like cherry blossoms in in now that in Washington's Japanese yeah it's almost literally Japanese so no no not really Spring Training I hadn't thought of a baseball and again and the again the it took closure but I mean the promise of summer the promise of something better and and an America is about hope I mean that's you know well it's morning in America I get it yeah I totally get it and I think there's a fair case to be made but I just thought Christmas was too overwhelmingly American I voted winter third season spring white horses mention I mean let's just talk but it's just focus on Christmas for a second because is there any more American than Christmas because like you could say Thanksgiving because that's just literally an American holiday you can say for this I know but you can't say for the job because 4th of July everybody has a 4th of July for them like you would think it's Cinco de Meyer for the Mexicans it's not that's a head-fake but it's not their Independence Day ok but everybody has an Independence Day right nobody has a Thanksgiving so that's a good argument for Thanksgiving but Christmas with it's absurd wonderful capitalism yes I tell you why I it's absurd and I no longer find it wonderful because I find it a crash commercial at crass commercialism yeah and the and and the commercialism bugs me so yeah I suppose that's American but it is over-the-top American it well it's consumerism but but it's unpleasant and and it's not us at our best so it really depends on what the or hotdogs really us at our best but I would spring because I think hope and the emerging possibility of what's to come by the way there would always be a nine-month run away from the whatever the worst thing is sue it doesn't really hold but I liked it but warmth and possibility come in the spring and you and I both agree that I think Thanksgiving is more American than Christmas and they're in that same block of time but as we know Thanksgiving is the fall Christmas is the winter that's right so here's you we're gonna have a super fun at this point not just regular fun because I'm going to direct you to a pole that doesn't exist and might never exist later we might or might not put up a pole on tmz.com slash season where you will get to vote on the least american season we will not even put no summer and fall out in the running because they're too American because if you think it's one of those seasons I'm not interested in your vote ok so the only two choices will be the spring and winter and you people will get to decide what is the lease if you think either that summer or fall is the least American season you should consider yourself I don't know a disenfranchised voter in North Carolina or Ohio or Wisconsin we're not interested in your vote yes that's right just as Scott Walker heavily boba and Crisco but we don't want you to vote and your vote doesn't count you know you want to vote for fall being the least American season sorry I'm gonna need to see some voter ID somebody you might as well have been convicted of a misdemeanor in Florida in 1974 you're not voting music okay so I tuned this later on Sunday I guess when we put up their free version by then the poll might exist yeah so you're dirty I like my existing the voting might have been closed off yeah guess we will not let you vote do you idealize timeslice season if we get to but I have circled it on my piece of paper which had which has increased the chances of it coming to fruition okay well that was obviously the most important topic the rest is just fluff right so did you have a fight or a wrestling match or something or with Michael Smerconish no but I challenged them to won a wrestling match right no so that would have been hilarious or just a fight just all I got bad so I'll tell you what it was so you guys know Smerconish she's he's he's on CNN these days right he's on no he hops around yeah but he has a nightly show on POTUS radio on yeah which is politics radio on the unserious I didn't mention meet wrassling him or did it just pop into your head no I just I listen to POTUS serious 124 I mean I listen to a Springsteen Howard Stern baseball and POTUS radio those are like my yeah things I ever go you know what yeah it could be a good poll in that one what's most American out of those no one listens to POTUS radio I mean new one like I mean everything out serious gets like no ratings except I imagine Howard and and music any people listen to music and the Young Turks right but we're not are we on it now anymore no we're not okay so so you can say whatever yeah so I just mean like I can't just kidding I love my brothers and sister I think that POTUS radio I was trying this I wouldn't try to explain my wife totally agreed we were drove back from from Film Festival back home made a seven-hour car trip and we and and I was explaining that that post radio is the definition of the establishment there is nothing more establishment than POTUS radio you get some reliable information sometimes but if you and and don't get me wrong it isn't a powerful part of the establishment it's just if you want to know what the establishment singing join the 38 people listening to POTUS radio and you'll realize that they are getting that a hundred percent plus there is one person that was since the POTUS outside of you Michael sure of course of course it's good it's worth listening to I mean it's engaging they have some differences I particularly enjoy the press pool with Julie Mason she couldn't be more establishment but I but Smerconish is on and he is unbelievably is down so I like listening to her because I really you get a sense but I think even for the establishment he got something very wrong today related to the president he was he pretty he put out of pulse it was truth is you're trying to mentioned the president and he had a poll he was a poll every day and his poll was will the Woodward book fear right so it's called yep move the needle and he made and are significantly I think yeah which is a relevant adverb because yeah I think it will move the needle a little right but his own opinion on his argument was no it will not and I I don't know no one knows but I thought your he compared it to the other guy's book was there's no Wolf Wolf Michael Wolf Michael wolf dash pack.com right totally and he read some clips pretending that they were this is the most promotion it's pretentious it's ever done no no and I also love smirk okay there's a bizarre Smerconish love in the building which makes no sense no later I will tell you about how I threatened to wrastlin so he said that he read some allegations in the book and then was like haha those are from Michael Wolf's book mmm did i trick you it was like good one the entertainment value the Smerconish brings to the world so like it's the most uninteresting game ever played I was surprised that that in Woodward's book he'd that because he was saying it was Woodward's book that the Trump called Sally Yates the c-word and I was like I'm surprised bobble to a reported that turned out he didn't it was in Michael walls mom so he suggested that it will not move the needle at all we already know these allegations Michael Wolfe reported them and similar just confirms the the crazy nature of the Trump White House which was showed up at Michael's book and I thought I don't know but you're missing the point and for the establishment radio to miss the point the they were sort of eager in the establishment once they got a hold of that little that little yarn to pull oh look he's he even admitted right wolf did that he didn't have some stuff that he didn't write it down I remember what it was but he was easy to discredit right he and that argument that ben shapiro is using now well once you once you find one thing that can be discredited in the whole every and all 10,000 allegations in the book or out the window right so why do you even know a bunch if your argument I thought I saw him on Twitter on Twitter okay so I but but Bob Woodward is not Michael wolf and Bob Woodward is revered and I don't use the establishment as as negatively as you do but but we both know it's a thing right weed yeah and Bob Woodward is the definition of the establishment and he's done brilliant work in many often and and and and and he's a relevant voice who should not be ignored but so it is 50 billion times harder for everybody at CNN at MSNBC even at Fox News and Everett BuzzFeed at every relevant box at every well irrelevant website to dismiss Bob Woodward and therefore because they won't be able to dismiss it as it is much more likely than Michael Wolfe to have an effect on Trump whether it will move the needle significantly whatever you derma fit but I suspect that it will I don't think that means he's leaving office anytime soon because of it but I consider it it is very different than Michael wolfsburg so we already have just so many things to update you guys on we already have our first vote in TYT comm season four exist for a hole that doesn't exist that's right I will get to that later okay maybe in an hour and 20 minutes but and it's a famous person voting no no no so I because I and I will get this for Asli but I did I have to address things that are said one it will move the needle needle wrong to it has already moved in you know because I think it prompted Mike Pence write that op-ed today did you read I did I just had somebody tell me about it on the phone no no not even the op-ed which is amazing and and will move the needle by itself I'll get back to why the needle is being moved and who's moving in in a sec but but no the conspiracy theory that it was Mike Pence oh I thought it was just a joke by you that's actual conspiracy yeah it is because there was a word used in the article that his mother was it mother and and then the article ended strange it was say I got to get back because there's a woman in the room and and I gotta go find my wife I gotta get out of the room so there's a football game I got a walk out of disingenuously that's how it ended so I I guess that was a cool no seriously there was a word that people don't normally use that I actually don't think it's that unique a word but loadstar that John McCain was our lodestar or something along those lines right and people so people because everybody's now a detective but like a good one I would have looked up for other people who use that word so they immediately googled each like senior Trump official to see if they use the word lodestar and there is one guy who uses it consistently like my Mike Pence so Mike Pence's speechwriter likes that word pence likes that word yeah right yeah that's a great point by the way that it says probably a speech well I mean any I imagine if it's pants II you know I mean he probably didn't write it entirely himself and I write but on the other hand Mike Pence is the kind of square that would use the word lodestar a lot yeah yeah it was a whole load of load never used the word load start writing and that sounded like I'm people people have speech writers and they work with the guy making the speech that's not a that's not like Mike Pence's an idiot can't write his own speech oh yeah yeah but but you would never use the word lodestar if you were a speech writer a good one with a relationship with the person whom you're writing for which obviously pence would have you're not some hack you just brought in like you would never used that word unless the person used the word like how'd you write Jack Reed load story but like no yeah yeah so when my speechwriter was writing this show he put no load starts there because I don't normally say let's yeah okay so that's a super-fun conspiracy theory but anyway back to why the needle has been moved so Woodward's book comes out it causes a senior administration official to write the most unprecedented shocking I bet I have ever seen then and I know we use that a lot on the Trump here because everything has been without shocking on the president think we'd ever seen and they're not exaggerations they are true by a mile by a country mile okay they are the lodestar of truth what what in the Lone Star Trek that did let half the things that happen today are the most shocking unprecedented things that have ever happened there's a communion our lifetime sin Americanism there's a comedian called Laurie Kilmartin I think and she's a liberal I don't know she said I go regret whatever I she's she's on the right side of to me right but she occasionally she does a good thing and she just takes whatever the main story of the day she I don't know this does is every day or twice a week or whatever and she just pretends that it was President Clinton who did it you know president Hillary Clinton today and so sure here was you know an anonymous high-ranking official in Clinton administration wrote this that yeah you read it and you're like yes she be impeached like every time every time every time she does something with this you'd be like holy moly out the story would never die and yet every Trump story and maybe it would be if Clinton did it every day too but but she wouldn't it wouldn't it it is shocking to think about how things would be different if any of these things had been done if Hillary Clinton threatened to fire her Attorney General for not as you tweeted about for not bending investigations to a summer to help Democrats write immediate impeachment within the week and I hope that I am correct in saying that I think for both of us we would think oh she's she's crossed a line she can't come back yeah I mean look at there are retired early free time for president Cain oh okay there would literally hundreds of those stories that would have gotten Hillary Clinton beached I mean look at my favorite story that everybody forgets and that way and if you you might not even even heard the story because there are so many fantastical unbelievable stories about Trump that you it might have just lost it in the waterfall or or when I say oh yeah that was so mental and no one ever talks about it is when he raided his doctor's office and he had his personal security and this was what less than a year ago there's a wall yes so far I don't even know what you're talking about no that's amazing right saying you don't even know or I remember it yeah yeah he had his personal security guards go over to his own doctor's office crazy doctor with the lazy the Bornstein or whatever right and break-in physically break in move the doctor out of the way take Trump's files and run out that's definitely true yeah it's mental beyond belief that's like you could argue that's kind of mini water cake because there's a break-in right right it's of his doctor's office that's when it why the doctor turned on him everybody turns on him because he's so freakin crazy so the doctor was the doctor who said he was a healthier than president ever yeah yeah so that dr. then get Kate it was he's like they broke into my office they stole my files this is so weird okay by the way of course I didn't write the letter they let it say Trump was the healthiest person that ever lived she's like of course they wrote it in the limo they brought it up and made me sign it security guard who was running security guards loyal and connected to president Hillary Clinton broke into the offices of her doctor and removed all of her files amid accusations that she was whatever the thing was that she had parking I mean perhaps in prison right right we forgot that story about drum full because it's a it's a non-stop avalanche of insanity it's like you know it is I mean you know there's a lot of comparison of things that people don't quite know enough about my and I certainly fall into this trap too but a lot of Nixon comparisons and and and Nixon was a much smarter person much more educated yeah that's more interested in the world but but I'm not sure there's a temptation to think that Trump is far more corrupt than Nixon I'm not sure they had a Nixon was not interested in personal wealth right but he was interested in power and doing anything he could keep it I mean the lost Nixon broke were frickin staggering right he and I tell the story often but I mean when Arthur Bremer shot George Wallace in Maryland during the 1972 campaign Nixon told Chuck Colson to call his guys the same kind of guys if not the same guys who broke into the Watergate to to go to Bremer's apartment and plant McGovern literature there even so that when the FBI arrived they they'd let's look at some against reporters shot Wallace uh-huh it's on the tapes he just says it to do it right this amazing and then the they sent a guy and the guy said I by the time I got there the FBI was already there so nice opportunity opportunity lost yeah yeah yeah Jason was run out of office because he was in a sense like Trump a career criminal he was a career criminal yeah a lot of hit but almost all this criminality is centered around politics whereas most of trumps criminality was revolved around money yeah now this is the first half hour basically the full episode is for members and you're going to love it so come join us at TYT calm sighs join
