>> GOOD MORNING, AINSLEY.

19
00:00:28,048 --> 00:00:30,249
I'M HEADING BACK OUT TO

20
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,183
THREE IMPACTED COUNTIES IN

21
00:00:31,184 --> 00:00:31,950
THE PANHANDLE TODAY.

22
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:35,187
WE STILL HAVE 60,000 PEOPLE

23
00:00:35,188 --> 00:00:36,155
WITHOUT POWER.

24
00:00:36,156 --> 00:00:38,057
THIS HURRICANE WAS LIKE A

25
00:00:38,058 --> 00:00:40,059
GIGANTIC TORNADOES WITH

26
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,894
14-FOOT STORM SURGE.

27
00:00:41,895 --> 00:00:42,728
JUST DISSEMINATED OUR

28
00:00:42,729 --> 00:00:43,095

00:00:43,096 --> 00:00:44,963
SO, RIGHT NOW I'M CONTINUING

30
00:00:44,964 --> 00:00:46,565
TO TRY TO HELP PEOPLE GET

31
00:00:46,566 --> 00:00:47,933
THEIR POWER BACK.

32
00:00:47,934 --> 00:00:49,268
GET THEIR CELL PHONE SERVICE

33
00:00:49,269 --> 00:00:49,568
BACK.

34
00:00:49,569 --> 00:00:50,769
MAKE SURE THEY HELP REBUILD

35
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:51,737
THEIR HOUSES.

36
00:00:51,738 --> 00:00:53,439
WE HAVE GOT OVER 70,000

37
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,306
PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY SIGNED

38
00:00:54,307 --> 00:00:55,741
UP FOR FEMA AND WE ARE

39
00:00:55,742 --> 00:00:57,376
TRYING TO WORK WITH

40
00:00:57,377 --> 00:00:58,444
ORGANIZED STATE, FEDERAL AND

41
00:00:58,445 --> 00:01:00,012
LOCAL RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE

42
00:01:00,013 --> 00:01:01,947
KEEP HELPING THESE FAMILIES.

43
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:02,581
AINSLEY: WHAT'S YOUR MIND

44
00:01:02,582 --> 00:01:06,418
SET WHEN IT COMES TO HELPING

45
00:01:06,419 --> 00:01:06,952
HURRICANE FAMILIES.

46
00:01:06,953 --> 00:01:08,454
YOU HAVE BILL NELSON GO OUT

47
00:01:08,455 --> 00:01:10,022
AND CAMPAIGN RIGHT NOW.

48
00:01:10,023 --> 00:01:11,156
WHILE YOU ARE GOVERNOR YOU

49
00:01:11,157 --> 00:01:12,091
HAVE TO BE ON THE GROUND

50
00:01:12,092 --> 00:01:13,492
HELPING THOSE FAMILIES.

51
00:01:13,493 --> 00:01:16,061
DOLLS

52
00:01:16,062 --> 00:01:16,161
DOESS

53
00:01:16,162 --> 00:01:17,830
DOES HE HAVE AN ADVANTAGE.

54
00:01:17,831 --> 00:01:19,465
>> THE WAY I THINK ABOUT IT

55
00:01:19,466 --> 00:01:20,933
I GREW UP IN A VERY POOR

56
00:01:20,934 --> 00:01:22,367
FAMILY IN THE MIDWEST.

57
00:01:22,368 --> 00:01:24,136
I REMEMBER MY MOM, A SINGLE

58
00:01:24,137 --> 00:01:25,404
MOM, WHAT WOULD SHE WANT IF

59
00:01:25,405 --> 00:01:26,905
THIS HAPPENED WHERE SHE WAS

60
00:01:26,906 --> 00:01:28,240
LIVING, IF A TORNADO CAME

61
00:01:28,241 --> 00:01:29,541
THROUGH AND THAT'S WHAT I

62
00:01:29,542 --> 00:01:29,975
THINK ABOUT.

63
00:01:29,976 --> 00:01:30,976
I THINK ABOUT ALL THOSE

64
00:01:30,977 --> 00:01:31,443
FAMILIES.

65
00:01:31,444 --> 00:01:32,711
SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE

66
00:01:32,712 --> 00:01:34,480
THEY HAVE FOOD AND WATER, A

67
00:01:34,481 --> 00:01:35,914
TARP TO, YOU KNOW, COVER

68
00:01:35,915 --> 00:01:37,616
THEIR HOUSE.

69
00:01:37,617 --> 00:01:39,118
THEY GET FEMA BENEFITS.

70
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,452
THEY GET BACK TO WORK.

71
00:01:40,453 --> 00:01:41,920
GET THEIR COMPANIES OPEN.

72
00:01:41,921 --> 00:01:43,455
THAT'S WHAT I THINK ABOUT.

73
00:01:43,456 --> 00:01:45,591
MY OPPONENT IS JUST

74
00:01:45,592 --> 00:01:46,158
FASCINATING.

75
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:53,198
HE DID A COUPLE PHOTO OPS.

76
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:54,199
THERE IS NOTHING CAN I DO.

77
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,934
IF YOU NEED ME, GIVE ME A

78
00:01:55,935 --> 00:01:56,235
CALL.

79
00:01:56,236 --> 00:01:56,835
IT'S FEMA.

80
00:01:56,836 --> 00:01:57,970
IT'S A FEDERAL RESPONSE

81
00:01:57,971 --> 00:01:58,403
ORGANIZATION.

82
00:01:58,404 --> 00:01:59,538
HE COULD BE HELPFUL WITH

83
00:01:59,539 --> 00:01:59,838
THAT.

84
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:01,874
HE COULD BE HELPFUL WITH

85
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:02,741
TYNDALL.

86
00:02:02,742 --> 00:02:04,910
TYNDALL WAS DISSEMINATED.

87
00:02:04,911 --> 00:02:07,813
THAT'S PROBABLY OVER 20,000

88
00:02:07,814 --> 00:02:09,181
JOBS, 11,000 PEOPLE WORKING

89
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:10,214
ON TYNDALL, ALL THOSE

90
00:02:10,216 --> 00:02:11,884
FAMILIES, HE JUST TURNS HIS

91
00:02:11,885 --> 00:02:14,319
BACK TO THEM SAYS OH, I'M

92
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,754
NOT WORRY ABOUT YOU.

93
00:02:15,755 --> 00:02:16,755
BILL NELSON IS WORRIED ABOUT

94
00:02:16,756 --> 00:02:18,157
ONE PERSON'S JOB, HIS JOB.

95
00:02:18,158 --> 00:02:19,591
SO I'M GOING TO KEEP DOING.

96
00:02:19,592 --> 00:02:21,493
THIS MY WIFE IS ON THE

97
00:02:21,494 --> 00:02:21,960
CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

98
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:23,262
NOT SOMETHING SHE HE WANTED

99
00:02:23,263 --> 00:02:23,562
TO DO.

100
00:02:23,563 --> 00:02:25,264
I TOLD HER I WANTED TO RUN

101
00:02:25,265 --> 00:02:26,331
FOR GOVERNOR 8 YEARS AGO.

102
00:02:26,332 --> 00:02:27,432
SHE SAID THAT'S GREAT.

103
00:02:27,433 --> 00:02:29,034
I'M SCARED OF GIVING PUBLIC

104
00:02:29,035 --> 00:02:29,401
SPEECHES.

105
00:02:29,402 --> 00:02:30,836
BUT THAT'S WHAT SHE IS DOING

106
00:02:30,837 --> 00:02:31,870
EVERY DAY NOW.

107
00:02:31,871 --> 00:02:34,540
I FEEL SORRY FOR HER.

108
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:35,274
