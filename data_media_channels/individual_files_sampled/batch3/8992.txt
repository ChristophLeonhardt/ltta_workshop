ACHIEVEMENTS. Martha: VERY SPECIAL, VERY SPECIAL MAN. BRIT, THANK YOU SO MUCH. Martha: LET'S BRING IN GENERAL JACK KEANE. HE WAS ABLE TO TALK ABOUT OTHER THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON IN THE WORLD, BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT CHARLES THIS EVENING. THE AMAZING GIFT OF HIS WRITING AND HIS SWEETNESS. IT IS SO TYPICAL OF HIM THAT HE PREPARED US FOR TONIGHT. AND THAT ELOQUENCE, TOUCHING LETTER WHEN HE SAID GOODBYE TO AMERICA AND TO THE WORLD. AND TO EVERYBODY THAN OF HIM. IT WAS REALLY, QUITE REMARKABLE. IT IS SO TYPICAL OF CHARLES LIFE IT IS SO TYPICAL OF CHARLES LIF LIFE. ONE THING THAT STRUCK ME ABOUT HIM IS DEALING WITH THIS TRAGIC ILLNESS THAT HE HAD. I HAD SOLDIERS REACH OUT TO ME, THREE OF THEM, OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS WHO HAD SERIOUS INJURIES LIKE HIS. AND THE FIRST TIME I APPROACHED CHARLES ABOUT IT, THEY WANTED TO TALK TO HIM. HE SAID, OF COURSE. I WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY. HERE IS A WAY I SAID, I KNOW YOU PROBABLY DO A LOT OF THIS, THIS GOES ON IN MY LIFE. AND HE JUST DEALT WITH THAT ISSUE. HE SAID, I'M GOING TO TELL HIM SOMETHING THAT THEY MAY NOT WANT TO HEAR. AND HE SAID, HE DOESN'T TALK ABOUT THIS PUBLICLY, OF COURSE. AND HE SAYS, I AM GOING TO TELL THEM, THE THING THAT ENABLED ME TO GO ON WITH MY LIFE AND HAVE A MEANINGFUL LIFE, DESPITE THIS TRAGIC ILLNESS WAS A HUNDRED PERCENT ACCEPTANCE OF WHAT HAPPENED. WITHOUT THAT ACCEPTANCE AND KNOWING THAT I WILL NEVER WALK AGAIN, I WILL NEVER BE, I WILL NEVER BE THE PREVIOUS CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER. I WILL NEVER HAVE ANY OF THAT PREVIOUSLY. I'M NOT GOING TO THROW THE REST OF MY LIFE AWAY, MENTALLY, EMOTIONALLY, AND SPIRITUALLY BECAUSE OF IT. THAT'S IS WHAT I'M GOING TO TELL THEM. HOPEFULLY, IT WILL BE OF SOME ASSISTANCE TO THEM. WE HAD A RELATIONSHIP IN AND AROUND THE GREENROOM AND FOX. WE NEVER, MARTHA Martha: THAT IS WHERE THE BEST CONVERSATIONS HAPPEN, BY THE WAY. WE TALK ABOUT BASEBALL, WE CHARACTERIZED IT AS A THINKING MAN'S SPORT. WE WERE A LITTLE BIT ARROGANT ABOUT THAT IN TERMS OF PEOPLE'S FASCINATIONS WITH OTHER ENDEAVORS IN AMERICA. BUT WE LOVED THAT. THEN, ALWAYS, IT GOT AROUND TO CHARLES KNEW THAT I HAD A BACKGROUND DIFFERENT FROM HIS. IT WAS ALWAYS AFTER SOME KERNEL OF INFORMATION. WHAT ABOUT THIS? WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS? WHAT IS THIS ISSUE, HERE, DEALING WITH IRAQ, OR AFGHANISTAN? HAS MIND WAS ALWAYS WORKING. WE ACTUALLY HAD SOME FUN WITH IT, A COUPLE OF TIMES. I AM SITTING IN THE GREENROOM, I TALKED TO AT ABOUT THE MOCK HIM ABOUT IT Martha: DID HE GIVE YOU ANY CRITIC HE BREAKS HIS BACK IN THAT WHEELCHAIR. MAKE SURE THAT HE HASN'T GONE. HE SAID, OKAY GENERAL. I WAS A AGAIN TONIGHT. I TOOK THE INFORMATION, I GIVE ABSOLUTELY NO CREDIT WHATSOEVER. I WAS SO HONORED AND HUMBLED BY CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER USING ANYTHING THAT HE EVER HAD TO SAY. WHAT A CRITICAL THINKER, HIS ABILITY TO ANALYZE, A WISE MAN TO BE SURE. AND THEN, MARTHA, AS YOU KNOW, SO GRACIOUS AND HUMBLE ABOUT IT. GOD GAVE HIM A GIANT OF A MIND AND HE USED IT. HE USED IT TO ITS FULLEST. HE MADE LIFE BETTER AND LET PEOPLE UNDERSTAND COMPLICATED, AND TRICYCLE ISSUES I CAN IMAGINE ALL OF THE ISSUES IN THIS COUNTRY THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BETTER BECAUSE OF CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER. THEY BEEN ABSOLUTELY EXTRA ORDINARY. AND ON TOP OF ALL THAT, HE IS A REGULAR GUY. HE IS SO APPROACHABLE. HE IS A REAL GUY. AND YOU CAN HAVE FUN WITH HIM, AND ENJOYED HIS COMPANY. I DID NOT HAVE THE LONG, PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP THAT SO MANY OTHERS HAVE HAD. BUT I WILL TELL YOU UP, MY RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM WAS MEANINGFUL. AUNT, I LOVE TO BEING AROUND THE GUY AND I MISS HIM TERRIBLY. Martha: YOU DIDN'T MESS AROUND WITH THAT. HE DROVE THE CONVERSATION. Martha: ABSOLUTELY. LET'S TAKE A LOOK. I THINK WE HAVE THE MOMENT OF SILENCE AT NATIONALS PARK THIS EVENING IN MEMORY OF CHARLES. THIS IS AN IMAGE FROM THAT, EARLIER THIS EVENING. OBVIOUSLY, IT WAS A PLACE THAT HE LOVED SO MUCH, AND THEY LOVED THE FACT THAT HE LOVED THEM. THEY WERE HIS TEAM. AND THAT CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER LOVED NOTHING MORE THAN TO BE IN THE STADIUM. I REALLY ENJOY THE PICTURES IN THE VIDEOS OF BRET BAIER AND HIM THERE. HE WENT WITH SO MANY OF HIS FRIENDS FROM "SPECIAL REPORT." IT IS DEFINITELY A HEARTBREAKING AND POTENT MOMENT FOR ALL THE PEOPLE AND NATIONAL STADIUM. THEY WILL CELEBRATE CHARLES FOR YEARS TO COME. BASEBALL WAS AN EXTENSION OF HIS LIFE. IT HAD REAL MEANING TO HIM. HE UNDERSTOOD THE GAME, THE COMPLICATION. MOST PEOPLE GET BORED BY BASEBALL BECAUSE IT IS TOO SLOW. BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS, IF YOU ARE REALLY INTO THE GAME, YOU ARE WATCHING EVERY PITCH, AND YOU'RE THINKING WHAT THE PICTURE IS GOING TO DO, WHAT THE BATTER IS GOING TO DO, AND HE UNDERSTOOD THE GAME FULLY AND COMPLETELY. IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING OUT THERE. HE LOVED THE GAME, HE LOVED THE
