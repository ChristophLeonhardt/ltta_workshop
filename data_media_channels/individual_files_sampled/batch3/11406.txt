now speculations rife that the UK Minister for International Development is about to face the chop after it came to light she held unofficial meetings with key Israeli officials during a holiday if confirmed pretty Patel would become the second minister to go in just a matter of days let's get the details now from our London correspondent Anastacio gherkin and nastya it doesn't seem to be going at all well for the Conservatives at the moment does it well yeah Nikki you're absolutely right there's more scandal yet again indicating that Teresa may potentially hasn't been keeping her house in order very well this time around we have a big scandal unraveling following this International Development Secretary potentially about to be sacked by Theresa May following a scandal that was described here as a cover-up involving over a dozen meetings with Israeli officials without appropriately disclosing this information to Theresa May and the rest of the government in the appropriate manner we do know that Priti Patel has been summoned to appear at Downing Street later today her trip to Africa was cut short and she's said to be on her way to London right now following revelations that during what was described as a holiday back in August she had met with over 12 Israeli officials and leaders including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu without appropriately discussing this in advance with Theresa May as well as the Foreign Office then we do know that in September there were said to be two more meetings as well as several other accusations that have been raising eyebrows and the way this has been described in Westminster is as rebellious and in defiance of the British government and really we have been hearing calls going rampant in terms of sacking her as well as foreign secretary Boris Johnson we shouldn't be applying a special standard to Boris Johnson I mean if if Priti Patel has to go I find it difficult to see how he can stay you know that the old adage that you know careless talk costs lives applies above all to Britain's chief diplomat and I find it difficult to see how he can stare either well Boris Johnson is obviously no stranger to controversy but his latest blunder came following comments that he made involving a case of a British citizen being kept in Iran that could potentially prolong the amount of time this British citizen has to stay in jail in Iran lots of questions about whether or not that behavior in his part was appropriate and all of this comes as Teresa Mae's house of cards really seems to be tumbling left and right because of course we have been seeing most recently the scandals and accusations and investigations looking into the potential sex sexual harassment involving cabinet ministers as well as of course just very recently the resignation of the UK defence secretary Michael Fallon over issues of inappropriate behavior so let's see how this unravels but it seems to be clear that at this point anything but calm waters here in Westminster more damage control for the Conservative Party there that's nasty Turkey no thanks for the details
