COULD CLEARLY RESONATE FAR
BEYOND THIS EVENING.
BRET?
>> Bret: ERIC SHAWN IN
PENNSYLVANIA TONIGHT.
WHILE REPUBLICANS ARE MOSTLY
PULLING IN THE SAME DIRECTION
THIS ELECTION YEAR AND TRYING TO
MAINTAIN THEIR CONGRESSIONAL
MAJORITIES, DEMOCRATS ARE STILL
TRYING TO FIND A UNIFYING
MESSAGE AS THEY SEEK TO FLIP THE
HOUSE AND THE SENATE.
TONIGHT, CORRESPONDENT
DOUG McKELWAY LOOKS AT THE
PERCEPTION THAT DEMOCRATS ARE
LOSING MOMENTUM.
>> DEMOCRAT'S HAVE BEEN
CONFIDENT OF A LONG-TERM BLUE
WAVE THAT HAVE ALLOWED THEM TO
FLIP 23 SEATS AND REGAIN HOUSE
MAJORITY.
THE WHITE HOUSE SEES SIGNS THAT
THE BLUE WAVE MAY BE LOSING
STEAM.
>> President Trump: WE ARE
UNLOCKING NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR
PROSPERITY AND PEACE.
ALL OF THESE CHANGES ARE
HAPPENING BECAUSE AMERICA IS
BEING RESPECTED AGAIN.
>>   REPUBLICAN HOPEFULS FIND
STRENGTH IN THE HOSTAGE RELEASE,
THE EMBASSIES MOVED TO
JERUSALEM, AND OPEN SKIES
AGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED ARAB
EMIRATES, A TAX CUT AND A 20
EURO LOW UNEMPLOYMENT RATE.
THE UPCOMING SOMETHING DUMB LIKE
A SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG UN TO
COME IF IT HAPPENS, IS LOOKING
AT MORE SUCCESS.
IT WILL HELP NUDGE APPROVAL
RATINGS UP WORRIED OR A COATTAIL
EFFECT.
HIS ADVANTAGE IN MARCH SHRUNK TO
SEVEN POINTS IN APRIL.
ANOTHER DEMOCRATIC POLE SAW THE
LEAD SLIPPING FROM 15 POINTS IN
JANUARY TO FIVE POINTS IN APRIL.
DEMOCRATS HAVE LEARNED SOME HARD
LESSONS FROM 2016 AND HAVE
CHANGED THEIR STRATEGY.
>> WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING AS A
DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE IS
ORGANIZING EVERYWHERE.
NO ONE EVER THOUGHT WE WOULD WIN
ALABAMA, BUT THE REASON WE WON
ALABAMA IS BECAUSE WE INVESTED
THERE.
WE INVESTED IN RURAL IOWA.
DEMOCRATS ARE SHOWING UP WITH A
POSITIVE MESSAGE.
>> THAT MESSAGE INCLUDES A $15
MINIMUM WAGE.
GOVERNMENT-FUNDED COLLEGE LOANS
AND CHILD CARE.
OTHER KITCHEN TABLE ISSUES AND
CONCERNS OF WOMEN IN THE ME TO
AIR OUT.
>> WHEN WE GET TO THE MIDTERMS
IN 2018, YOU WILL SEE WOMEN TURN
OUT.
>> IN PENNSYLVANIA WHICH IS
PIVOTAL TO DEMOCRATS' HOPE OF
TAKING THE HOUSE, MANY OF THE
MIDTERMS HAVE MORE THAN 20
DEMOCRATIC WOMEN RUNNING.
>> THERE'S ALSO A WILD CARD THAT
COULD LIMIT THE BLUE WAVE
EFFECT.
