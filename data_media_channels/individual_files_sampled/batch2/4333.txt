James clapper James clapper has written a new book that is just out today it's called facts and fears title comes from a quote from General George Patton quote the time to take counsel of your fears as before you make an important battle decision that's the time to listen to every fear you can imagine when you have collected all the facts and all the fears and made your decision turn off all your fears and go ahead clapper uses that quote and takes it as his title for his book that's out today in part to explain why he has chosen to write a book he says quote as I left government service I had my own decision to make I had not planned to write anything but after experiencing the election the unprecedented Russian interference in our political process and the behavior by and impact of the Trump administration I changed my mind he says quote I think the catalyst was the stark visceral realization of seeing the fundamental pillars of our country being undermined both by the Russians and by the president this shook me she tell you James clapper then goes on to say some absolutely remarkable things about the sitting president of the United States I will quote you what he says about President Trump in just a moment it will curl your hair but the the news that James clapper makes in this new book is remarkable not just because of the sort of position that he's taking and the observations that he's making the opinions that he's always saying what's remarkable about the news that he's making in this new book is is remarkable because of what he is in a position to know what he has seen what he has been through clapper was Director of National Intelligence under President Obama he's only the fourth person to have ever held that job which was created after 9/11 he took that job in 2010 he held it until the day Trump was inaugurated in January 2017 which means Jim clapper held the intelligence director job for longer than all three people who had it before him combined clapper was there at the head of the intelligence community for all of the intelligence scandals and stories you remember for most of the last decade Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning and the raid that killed bin Laden and WikiLeaks and Benghazi and and NSA spying in the book you get a detailed explanation from clapper as to what went wrong in a now-famous back and forth he had with Senator Ron Wyden in which he said that the NSA wasn't collecting data on millions of Americans when in fact it was he gives his whole explanation about what went wrong there before he was Director of National Intelligence James clapper was running a different Intelligence Agency which put him in a position to be intimately involved with the disastrous failure in advance of the Iraq war when the intelligence community in the Bush administration said there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq when there weren't James clapper personally has negotiated the release of American prisoners from North Korea clapper when he was head of the Defense Intelligence Agency that's when that agency was caught up in a huge emotional national scandal over the pursuit of American prisoners of war and servicemembers listed as missing in action long after the end of the Vietnam War James clapper has been there for all of it he is a controversial figure in lots of different circles for lots of different reasons because he's been at least tangentially and in many cases centrally involved in just about every intelligence story that has made the news in the past 40 years and intelligence issues rarely become national news stories because there's such good news it's almost always when something's gone bad but in this new book James clapper is scathing about President Trump which is remarkable itself coming from a career nonpartisan military and intelligence since John F Kennedy but listen to this this comes right at the end of the book the last giant intelligence story and scandal that clapper was right in the middle of things for was obviously the the Russian attack on the 2016 election you heard me read the part where he explains that's part of why he decided he was going to write a book the book explains in great detail what the intelligence community knew about the Russian attack how they responded what decisions were made while the attack was underway while President Obama was still president again clapper left the job of National Intelligence director on the day of Trump's inauguration in the intelligence community assessment that clapper released in January before Trump was inaugurated you'll remember that the intelligence community announced its conclusion that Russia had attacked the presidential election specifically to try to help Donald Trump win but the intelligence community didn't try to assess whether or not the Russian attack worked whether they actually succeeded in giving Trump the win when he otherwise would have lost that was where the intelligence community's official assessment left off in January 2017 just as James clapper was leaving office after decades in Intel well now that he is out of government service and a private citizen James clapper is ready to say what he really thinks on that front and what he really saw happen okay check this out by May 2017 when James Comey was fired his FBI director we had learned that the Russian operation had been even more expansive than the intelligence community had assessed in January we knew now that the Russians had thousands of Twitter accounts and tens of thousands of BOTS that posted more than a million tweets they posted more than a thousand videos on YouTube with days of streaming content Facebook has said Russian contact reached 126 million of its American users which is an astonishing number considering that only 139 million Americans voted as the leader of the intelligence community I testified that the IC did not attempt to assess whether the Russian influence campaign impacted the results of the election as a private citizen I have no doubt they influenced at least some voters looking at the savvy ways the Russians targeted specific voter groups for instance buying ads on Facebook promoting Clinton's support of the black lives matter movement but ensuring those ads ran only on the pages of white conservative voters in swing states looking at how they created lies that helped trump and hurt Clinton and promoted these falsehoods through social media and state sponsored channels to the point that the traditional US media were unwittingly spreading Russian propaganda looking at how they ran a multi-faceted campaign and sustained it at a high level from early 2015 until election day in 2016 clapper includes of course the Russian effort affected the outcome of the election surprising even themselves they swung the election to a trump win to conclude otherwise stretches logic common sense and credulity to the breaking point less than 80,000 votes in three key states won the election I have no doubt that more votes than that were influenced by this massive effort by the Russians oh the immediate past Director of National Intelligence who was Director of National Intelligence during the Russian attack on the election says he has no doubt that the Russian attack in his words quote swung the election to a trump win that means that the immediate past Director of National Intelligence believes that Donald Trump is only president because of a successful foreign intelligence operation to make him president and as to the question of whether or not the president's campaign benefited from that operation just by dumb luck or whether they were in on it in some way here's what James clapper says now in this book that is just out tonight quote as the investigations have advanced the specter of collusion has dominated the discussion when I left office on January 20th 2017 I'd seen no smoking gun evidence that the Russian government in the Trump campaign were in substantive coordination of their efforts I didn't learn about the June 9 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Trump's closest advisors and representatives of the Russian government purportedly to discuss dirt on Hillary and sanctions against wealthy Russians I didn't learn about that until I was firmly retired but what I did see as DNI is that the Russians and the campaign's seemed to employ strikingly parallel messaging in social media posts and public statements effectively complementing each other to great effect with no attempt to hide it that combined effort appeared to go well beyond candidate Trump's calling on a foreign power to find 30,000 missing emails belonging to his political opponent or his praise for WikiLeaks for publishing materials Russian intelligence had stolen on a routine basis whenever the campaign published an allegation that hurt Clinton the Russians would repeat amplify and embellish that claim and when the Russians promulgated a conspiracy theory about her Trump would repeat it at campaign rallies and on Twitter whether secretly coordinated or not whether there was actual collusion or not this parallelism constituted a putative team effort by the Russian government and the Trump campaign he served as Director of National Intelligence for six and a half years including for the duration of the Russian attack on the 2016 election he says in this new book just out today that the Russian attack did sway the election that Donald Trump would not be president but for that attack and he says the Trump campaign helped in the attack he calls it a putative team effort James clapper joins us next hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if
