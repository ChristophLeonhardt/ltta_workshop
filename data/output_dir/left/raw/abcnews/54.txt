1
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:13,613
>> Announcer: NOW REPORTING 

2
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:14,113
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS. 

3
00:00:14,113 --> 00:00:14,480
>> GOOD MORNING.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,582
WE WANT TO GO STRAIGHT TO THE 

5
00:00:16,582 --> 00:00:18,184
SENATE FLOOR.

6
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,619
AL FRANKEN RESPONDING TO CALLS 

7
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,220
ASKING FOR HIS RESIGNATION. 

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,489
>> I FELT WE HAD ENTERED AN 

9
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:24,357
IMPORTANT MOMENT IN THE HISTORY 

10
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,524
OF THIS COUNTRY.

11
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:28,327
WE WERE FINALLY BEGINNING TO 

12
00:00:28,327 --> 00:00:30,062
LISTEN TO WOMEN ABOUT THE WAYS 

13
00:00:30,062 --> 00:00:34,234
IN WHICH MEN'S ACTIONS AFFECT 

14
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:34,434
THEM.

15
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,904
THE MOMENT WAS LONG OVERDUE.

16
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:38,938
I WAS EXCITED FOR THAT 

17
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:42,075
CONVERSATION AND HOPEFUL THAT IT

18
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,777
WOULD RESULT IN REAL CHANGE THAT

19
00:00:44,777 --> 00:00:47,113
MADE LIFE BETTER FOR WOMEN ALL 

20
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:49,582
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IN EVERY 

21
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:54,287
PART OF OUR SOCIETY.

22
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:56,823
THEN THE CONVERSATION TURNED TO 

23
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:57,090
ME.

24
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,526
OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS A NUMBER

25
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,327
OF WOMEN HAVE COME FORWARD TO 

26
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:03,563
TALK ABOUT HOW THEY FELT MY 

27
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:07,133
ACTIONS HAD AFFECTED THEM.

28
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,602
I WAS -- I WAS SHOCKED.

29
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:12,805
I WAS UPSET.

30
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:15,141
IN RESPONDING TO THEIR CLAIMS I 

31
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:18,344
ALSO WANTED TO BE RESPECTFUL OF 

32
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,313
THAT BROADER CONVERSATION 

33
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:23,049
BECAUSE ALL WOMEN DESERVE TO BE 

34
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:24,984
HEARD AND THEIR EXPERIENCES 

35
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:27,420
TAKEN SERIOUSLY.

36
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,190
I THINK THAT WAS THE RIGHT THING

37
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,991
TO DO.

38
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:34,260
I ALSO THINK IT GAVE SOME PEOPLE

39
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,063
THE FALSE IMPRESSION THAT I WAS 

40
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:38,864
ADMITTING TO DOING THINGS THAT 

41
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:42,001
IN FACT I HAVEN'T DONE.

42
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,635
SOME OF THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST 

43
00:01:43,635 --> 00:01:46,940
ME ARE SIMPLY NOT TRUE.

44
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,343
OTHERS I REMEMBER VERY 

45
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:50,710
DIFFERENTLY.

46
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,614
I SAID AT THE OUTSET THAT THE 

47
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,416
ETHICS COMMITTEE WAS THE RIGHT 

48
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,150
VENUE FOR THESE ALLEGATIONS TO 

49
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,320
BE HEARD AND INVESTIGATED AND 

50
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,323
EVALUATED ON THEIR MERITS, THAT 

51
00:02:04,323 --> 00:02:06,960
I WAS PREPARED TO COOPERATE 

52
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,027
FULLY AND THAT I WAS CONFIDENT 

53
00:02:09,027 --> 00:02:11,998
IN THE OUTCOME.

54
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,600
YOU KNOW, AN IMPORTANT PART OF 

55
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,069
THE CONVERSATION WE'VE BEEN 

56
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,870
HAVING THE LAST FEW MONTHS HAS 

57
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,007
BEEN OUT HOW MEN ABUSE THEIR 

58
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:24,777
POWER AND PRIVILEGE TO HURT 

59
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,145
WOMEN.

60
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:28,547
I AM PROUD THAT DURING MY TIME 

61
00:02:28,547 --> 00:02:31,384
IN THE SENATE I HAVE USED MY 

62
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:36,188
POWER TO BE A CHAMPION OF WOMEN 

63
00:02:36,188 --> 00:02:38,624
AND THAT I HAVE EARNED A 

64
00:02:38,624 --> 00:02:39,659
REPUTATION AS SOMEONE WHO 

65
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,328
RESPECTS THE WOMEN I WORK 

66
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,831
ALONGSIDE EVERY DAY.

67
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,365
I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A VERY 

68
00:02:46,365 --> 00:02:48,200
DIFFERENT PICTURE OF ME PAINTED 

69
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,336
OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS, BUT I 

70
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:54,941
KNOW WHO I REALLY AM.

71
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,542
SERVING IN THE UNITED STATES 

72
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:58,044
SENATE HAS BEEN THE GREAT HONOR 

73
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,545
OF MY LIFE.

74
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:02,381
I KNOW IN MY HEART THAT NOTHING 

75
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:07,286
I HAVE DONE AS A SENATOR, 

76
00:03:07,286 --> 00:03:10,356
NOTHING, HAS BROUGHT DISHONOR ON

77
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,425
THIS INSTITUTION.

78
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:15,161
I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE ETHICS 

79
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:18,498
COMMITTEE WOULD AGREE.

80
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,299
NEVERTHELESS TODAY I AM 

81
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:22,335
ANNOUNCING THAT IN THE COMING 

82
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:27,106
WEEKS I WILL BE RESIGNING AS A 

83
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:31,377
MEMBER OF THE UNITED STATES 

84
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,379
SENATE.

85
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,649
I OF ALL PEOPLE AM AWARE THERE 

86
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:39,952
IS SOME IRONY BY THE FACT THAT I

87
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:42,054
AM LEAVING WHILE A MAN WHO 

88
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:44,724
BRAGGED ON TAPE ABOUT HIS 

89
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,126
HISTORY OF SEXUAL ASSAULT SITS 

90
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,961
IN THE OVAL OFFICE AND A MAN WHO

91
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:51,497
HAS REPEATEDLY PREYED ON YOUNG 

92
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:54,033
GIRLS CAMPAIGNS FOR THE SENATE 

93
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:57,670
WITH THE FULL SUPPORT OF HIS 

94
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,738
PARTY.

95
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,840
THIS DECISION IS NOT ABOUT ME.

96
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,011
IT'S ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF 

97
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:05,745
MINNESOTA.

98
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,513
IT HAS BECOME CLEAR THAT I CAN'T

99
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:11,451
BOTH PURSUE THE ETHICS COMMITTEE

100
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,518
PROCESS AND AT THE SAME TIME 

101
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:16,555
REMAIN AN EFFECTIVE SENATOR FOR 

102
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:17,589
THEM.

103
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,726
LET ME BE CLEAR, I MAY BE 

104
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,394
RESIGNING MY SEAT, BUT I'M NOT 

105
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,963
GIVING UP MY VOICE.

106
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,231
I WILL CONTINUE TO STAND UP FOR 

107
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:28,067
THE THINGS I BELIEVE IN AS A 

108
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:33,973
CITIZEN AND AS AN ACTIVIST.

109
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,441
MINNESOTA DESERVES A SENATOR WHO

110
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:39,612
CAN FOCUS WITH ALL HER ENERGY ON

111
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,746
ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES THEY 

112
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:45,551
FACE EVERY DAY.

113
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:48,620
THERE IS A BIG PART OF ME THAT 

114
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,889
WILL ALWAYS REGRET HAVING TO 

115
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,858
WALK AWAY FROM THIS JOB WITH SO 

116
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:55,628
MUCH WORK LEFT TO BE DONE.

117
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,396
BUT I HAVE FAITH THAT THE WORK 

118
00:04:57,396 --> 00:05:00,032
WILL CONTINUE BECAUSE I HAVE 

119
00:05:00,032 --> 00:05:01,867
FAITH IN THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE 

120
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:06,339
HELPED ME DO IT.

121
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:14,146
I HAVE FAITH IN THE DEDICATED, 

122
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:16,249
FUNNY, SELFLESS, BRILLIANT YOUNG

123
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:19,819
MEN AND WOMEN ON MY STAFF.

124
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,787
THEY HAVE SO MUCH MORE TO 

125
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:24,624
CONTRIBUTE TO OUR COUNTRY.

126
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,859
I HOPE THAT AS DISAPPOINTED AS 

127
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,861
THEY MAY FEEL TODAY, EVERYONE 

128
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,630
WHO HAS WORKED FOR ME KNOWS HOW 

129
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:36,068
MUCH I ADMIRE AND RESPECT THEM.

130
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:38,604
I HAVE FAITH IN MY COLLEAGUES, 

131
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:43,409
ESPECIALLY MY SENIOR SENATOR.

132
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,211
I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO

133
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:48,514
THIS JOB WITHOUT HER GUIDANCE 

134
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,348
AND WISDOM.

135
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:50,883
I HAVE FAITH OR AT LEAST HOPE, 

136
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:54,821
THAT MEMBERS OF THIS SENATE WILL

137
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,021
FIND THE POLITICAL COURAGE 

138
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:57,957
NECESSARY TO KEEP ASKING THE 

139
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:01,026
TOUGH QUESTIONS, HOLD THIS 

140
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:01,827
ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTABLE AND 

141
00:06:01,827 --> 00:06:07,266
STAND UP FOR THE TRUTH.

142
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,301
I HAVE FAITH IN THE ACTIVISTS 

143
00:06:09,301 --> 00:06:11,537
WHO ORGANIZED AND HELPED ME WIN 

144
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,772
MY FIRST CAMPAIGN AND WHO HAVE 

145
00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:16,742
KEPT ON ORGANIZING TO HELP FIGHT

146
00:06:16,742 --> 00:06:18,944
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO NEEDED US, 

147
00:06:18,944 --> 00:06:22,548
KIDS FACING BULLYING, SENIORS 

148
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,183
WORRIED ABOUT THE PRICE OF 

149
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:28,687
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, NATIVE 

150
00:06:28,687 --> 00:06:29,221
AMERICANS WHO HAVE BEEN 

151
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:32,291
OVERLOOKED FOR FAR TOO LONG, 

152
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,325
WORKING PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 

153
00:06:33,325 --> 00:06:36,262
TAKING IT ON A CHIN FOR A 

154
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:37,663
GENERATION, EVERYONE IN THE 

155
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,131
MIDDLE CLASS AND EVERYONE 

156
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:42,802
ASPIRING TO JOIN IT.

157
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,370
I HAVE FAITH IN THE PROUD LEGACY

158
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,807
OF PROGRESSIVE ADVOCACY THAT I 

159
00:06:48,807 --> 00:06:50,109
HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO BE A 

160
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:51,811
PART OF.

161
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,113
I THINK I PROBABLY REPEATED 

162
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:55,514
THESE WORDS 10,000 TIMES OVER 

163
00:06:55,514 --> 00:06:57,850
THE YEARS.

164
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,553
PAUL WELL STONE'S FAMOUS QUOTE 

165
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,421
THE FUTURE BELONGS TO THOSE WHO 

166
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:07,126
ARE PASSIONATE AND WORK HARD.

167
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:08,194
IT'S STILL TRUE.

168
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:12,632
IT WILL ALWAYS BE TRUE.

169
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:17,703
MOST OF ALL I HAVE FAITH IN 

170
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:18,137
MINNESOTA.

171
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:21,540
A BIG PART OF THIS JOB IS GOING 

172
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,876
AROUND THE STATE AND LISTENING 

173
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:26,145
TO WHAT PEOPLE NEED FROM 

174
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:26,445
WASHINGTON.

175
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:28,614
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT WHEN I'M 

176
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:32,685
HOME I AM BLOWN AWAY BY HOW MUCH

177
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:34,720
MINNESOTA HAS TO OFFER THE 

178
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,790
ENTIRE COUNTRY AND THE ENTIRE 

179
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,324
WORLD.

180
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,860
THE PEOPLE I'VE HAD THE HONOR OF

181
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,761
REPRESENTING ARE BRILLIANT AND 

182
00:07:42,761 --> 00:07:44,630
CREATIVE AND HARD WORKING AND 

183
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,634
WHOEVER HOLDS THIS SEAT NEXT 

184
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,303
WILL INHERIT THE CHALLENGE I'VE 

185
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:54,307
ENJOYED FOR THE LAST 8 1/2 YEARS

186
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:58,911
BEING AS GOOD AS THE PEOPLE YOU 

187
00:07:58,911 --> 00:07:59,812
SERVE.

188
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:03,916
THIS HAS BEEN A TOUGH FEW WEEKS 

189
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:04,517
FOR ME.

190
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:07,053
I AM A VERY, VERY LUCKY MAN.

191
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:11,256
I HAVE A BEAUTIFUL, HEALTHY 

192
00:08:11,256 --> 00:08:14,727
FAMILY THAT I LOVE AND THAT 

193
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:18,664
LOVES ME VERY MUCH.

194
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,733
I'M GOING TO BE JUST FINE.

195
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:28,441
I JUST LIKE TO END WITH ONE LAST

196
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:28,841
TH

197
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,443
THING.

198
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:34,145
I DID NOT GROW UP WANTING TO BE 

199
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:34,480
A POLITICIAN.

200
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,414
I CAME TO THIS RELATIVELY LATE 

201
00:08:36,414 --> 00:08:37,216
IN LIFE.

202
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,751
I HAD TO LEARN A LOT ON THE FLY.

203
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:41,821
IT WASN'T EASY AND IT WASN'T 

204
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:42,922
ALWAYS FUN.

205
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:46,025
I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT 

206
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:46,325
TODAY.

207
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:50,629
THIS IS A HARD THING TO DO WITH 

208
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:51,230
YOUR LIFE.

209
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,299
THERE ARE A LOT OF LONG HOURS 

210
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:58,904
AND LATE NIGHTS AND HARD 

211
00:08:58,904 --> 00:08:59,137
LESSONS.

212
00:08:59,137 --> 00:09:01,440
THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT ALL 

213
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,509
YOUR WORK AND SACRIFICE WILL 

214
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,312
EVER PAY OFF.

215
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:10,716
I WON MY FIRST ELECTION BY 312 

216
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:11,317
VOTES.

217
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:15,521
COULD HAVE EASILY GONE THE OTHER

218
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,657
WAY.

219
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:21,193
EVEN WHEN YOU WIN PROGRESS IS 

220
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:23,396
FAR FROM INEVITABLE.

221
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,164
PAUL WELL STONE SPENT HIS WHOLE 

222
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:30,368
LIFE WORKING FOR MENTAL LIFE 

223
00:09:30,368 --> 00:09:32,171
PAIRTY AND IT DIDN'T PASS UNTIL 

224
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:36,075
SIX YEARS AFTER PAUL DIED.

225
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,110
THIS YEAR A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO 

226
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,179
DIDN'T GROW UP IMAGINING THAT 

227
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,748
THEY WOULD EVER GET INVOLVED IN 

228
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:46,318
POLITICS HAVE DONE JUST THAT.

229
00:09:46,318 --> 00:09:49,221
THEY'VE GONE TO THEIR FIRST 

230
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:50,456
PROTEST MARCH OR MADE THEIR 

231
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:54,093
FIRST CALL TO A MEMBER OF 

232
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,495
CONGRESS OR MAYBE EVEN TAKEN THE

233
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,931
LEAP AND PUT THEIR NAMES ON A 

234
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:02,101
BALLOT FOR THE FIRST TIME.

235
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,871
IT CAN BE SUCH A RUSH TO LOOK 

236
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:10,776
AROUND A ROOM OF -- A ROOM FULL 

237
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,812
OF PEOPLE READY TO FIGHT 

238
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,780
ALONGSIDE YOU.

239
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,281
YOU FEEL THAT ENERGY TO IMAGINE 

240
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:20,686
THAT BETTER THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.

241
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:29,628
YOU TOO WILL EXPERIENCE

242
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:31,196
>> THERE WILL BE DAYS WHERE 

243
00:10:31,196 --> 00:10:33,132
YOU'LL WONDER WHETHER IT'S WORTH

244
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:33,298
IT.

245
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:39,605
WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW IS THAT 

246
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:40,672
EVEN TODAY, EVEN ON THE WORST 

247
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:44,477
DAY OF MY POLITICAL LIFE, I FEEL

248
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:50,116
LIKE IT'S ALL BEEN WORTH IT.

249
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,817
POLITICS, WE WERE TOLD, IS ABOUT

250
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:56,355
THE IMPROVEMENT OF PEOPLE'S 

251
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:56,756
LIVES.

252
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,424
I KNOW THAT THE WORK I'VE BEEN 

253
00:10:59,424 --> 00:11:03,229
ABLE TO DO HAS IMPROVED PEOPLE'S

254
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:03,429
LIVES.

255
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:08,667
I WOULD DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN IN 

256
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,102
A HEARTBEAT.

257
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:12,337
FOR A DECADE NOW, EVERY TIME I 

258
00:11:12,337 --> 00:11:14,373
WOULD GET TIRED OR DISCOURAGED 

259
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,042
OR FRUSTRATED, I WOULD THINK 

260
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,976
ABOUT THE PEOPLE I WAS DOING 

261
00:11:17,976 --> 00:11:19,745
THIS FOR AND WOULD GET ME BACK 

262
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:22,014
UP ON MY FEET.

263
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:25,251
I KNOW THE SAME WILL BE TRUE FOR

264
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:28,621
EVERYONE WHO DECIDES TO PURSUE A

265
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,389
POLITICS THAT IS ABOUT IMPROVING

266
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,825
PEOPLE'S LIVES.

267
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,361
AND I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT I WILL 

268
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,731
BE FIGHTING ALONGSIDE YOU EVERY 

269
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:41,534
STEP OF THE WAY.

270
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,635
WITH THAT, MR. PRESIDENT, I 

271
00:11:43,635 --> 00:11:46,238
YIELD THE FLOOR.

272
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,106
>> WITH THAT, THE NEWS, THE 

273
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:50,342
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR AL FRANKEN IS

274
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:51,811
RESIGNING HIS SEAT IN THE SENATE

275
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,179
IN THE COMING WEEKS, ON A DAY HE

276
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,481
CALLS THE WORST DAY OF HIS 

277
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:55,714
CAREER.

278
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,616
HE SAID THAT HE'S NEVER BROUGHT 

279
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:01,053
DISHONOR ON THE SENATE, 

280
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,121
RESPONDED IN SOME MEASURE FROM 

281
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,388
THE CALLS FROM EIGHT DIFFERENT 

282
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:05,624
WOMEN WHO ACCUSED HIM OF SEXUAL 

283
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:06,825
MISCONDUCT IN THE COMING WEEKS, 

284
00:12:06,825 --> 00:12:09,327
SAYING ALL WOMEN DESERVE TO BE 

285
00:12:09,327 --> 00:12:09,528
HEARD.

286
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:12,030
BUT SAYING THAT HE BELIEVES IN 

287
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,899
SOME OF THE CASES AT LEAST, THAT

288
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,101
THE ALLEGATIONS WERE NOT TRUE.

289
00:12:16,101 --> 00:12:17,736
IN OTHERS THAT HE REMEMBERS THEM

290
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:18,036
DIFFERENTLY.

291
00:12:18,036 --> 00:12:19,004
NEVERTHELESS, HE IS RESIGNING 

292
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,206
BECAUSE HE FEELS HE CANNOT SERVE

293
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:20,873
THE PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA, THE 

294
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,075
PEOPLE WHO ELECTED HIM, WHILE AN

295
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,444
ETHICS COMMITTEE INVESTIGATES.

296
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:28,080
HE ALSO WENT ON IN THAT SPEECH 

297
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,382
TO CALL OUT BOTH PRESIDENT TRUMP

298
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,284
AND PRESIDENT SENATE CANDIDATE 

299
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:33,652
ROY MOORE OF ALABAMA, WHO ARE 

300
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:35,621
ALSO FACING SEXUAL MISCONDUCT 

301
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,289
ALLEGATIONS, DENYING THEM, 

302
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,258
NOTING THE IRONY, AS HE STEPS 

303
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:39,892
DOWN, THEY REMAIN IN OFFICE.

304
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,760
I WANT TO GO TO OUR TEAM NOW, 

305
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,765
STARTING WITH OUR SENIOR 

306
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:47,900
CONGRE

307
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,767
CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT MARY

308
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,236
BRUCE ON HILL.

309
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,971
WE HEARD HIM DEFIANT, NOT 

310
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,706
CONTRITE, SAYING HIS ENTIRE 

311
00:12:54,706 --> 00:12:55,341
CAREER WOULD BE WORTH IT.

312
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:56,475
CLEARLY HE WANTED TO STAY IN THE

313
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:57,810
SENATE, MARY.

314
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,010
YESTERDAY, AFTER ANOTHER 

315
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,279
ACCUSATION FROM AN ANONYMOUS 

316
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,014
SOURCE, IT WAS SIMPLY 

317
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:02,314
IMPOSSIBLE.

318
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:05,450
THE FLOODGATES OPENED FROM HIS 

319
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,085
DEMOCRATIC SENATE COLLEAGUES. 

320
00:13:07,085 --> 00:13:08,787
>> Reporter: FRANKEN MADE IT 

321
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,256
CLEAR HE DOESN'T FEEL HIS 

322
00:13:11,256 --> 00:13:14,360
ACTIONS WARRANT HIS RESIGNATION,

323
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,962
BUT WHAT IS ALSO CLEAR IS HE 

324
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:17,529
LOST THE SUPPORT OF HIS 

325
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:17,830
COLLEAGUES.

326
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,065
HIS FELLOW DEMOCRATS CAME OUT 

327
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:20,632
AND SAID, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

328
00:13:20,632 --> 00:13:21,367
HE HAD TO RESIGN.

329
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,736
IT DID COME AFTER THAT LATEST 

330
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:24,870
ALLEGATION, THE ACCUSATIONS 

331
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,071
COMING OUT AGAINST HIM.

332
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,140
WE SAW A HANDFUL OF WOMEN 

333
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,808
SENATORS REALLY DRIVING THIS, 

334
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:30,743
COMING OUT IN WHAT APPEARED TO 

335
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,045
BE A COORDINATED PUSH, SAYING HE

336
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,180
HAD TO RESIGN.

337
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,350
THEN WE SAW IN LESS THAN 24 

338
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,653
HOURS NOW, AT LEAST 39 SENATORS 

339
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,653
WHO AGREED WITH THAT, INCLUDING 

340
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:43,422
THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER, CHUCK 

341
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,823
SCHUMER, WHO IS INCREDIBLY CLOSE

342
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:48,160
WITH AL FRANKEN BUT HAS SPENT A 

343
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,263
DIFFICULT LAST 24 HOURS, 

344
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:51,997
PERSONALLY PLEADING HIM TO DO 

345
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:55,000
WHAT HE JUST DID, STEPPING DOWN.

346
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,368
>> JOHN, AL FRANKEN CALLING OUT 

347
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,137
THE PRESIDENT THERE, AS WELL.

348
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,171
THE PRESIDENT HAD BEEN CRITICAL 

349
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,906
OF SENATOR FRANKEN ON TWITTER, 

350
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,875
EVEN AS HE DEFENDS ROY MOORE.

351
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:06,512
WHAT YOU HAVE NOW IS BOTH AL 

352
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,280
FRANKEN AND DEMOCRATIC 

353
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,481
REPRESENTATIVE JOHN CONYERS 

354
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:10,882
RESIGNING, SETTING UP A CLEAR 

355
00:14:10,882 --> 00:14:12,751
CONTRAST WITH SOME REPUBLICANS. 

356
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:15,854
>> CLEAR CONTRAST.

357
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,290
WHAT STRUCK ME ABOUT LISTENING 

358
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,191
TO SENATOR FRANKEN IS HE REALLY 

359
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,792
DOESN'T SEEM TO THINK HE DID 

360
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:21,994
ANYTHING WRONG OR SIGNIFICANTLY 

361
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:22,994
WRONG, BUT HE POINTED OUT WHAT 

362
00:14:22,994 --> 00:14:26,165
HE CALLED THE IRONY, THAT THE 

363
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:29,368
PRESIDENT, IN HIS WORDS, HAS 

364
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,170
ADMITTED ON TAPE TO COMMITTING 

365
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,539
SEXUAL ASSAULT.

366
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,042
HE FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT, YOU 

367
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,078
KNOW, SENATE CANDIDATE ROY MOORE

368
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,313
POSSIBLY ON HIS WAY TO THE U.S. 

369
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:44,082
SENATE IS GUILTY OF THINGS FAR 

370
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:45,884
WORSE THAN ANYTHING THAT FRANKEN

371
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:48,821
HAS ADMITTED TO OF BEEN ACCUSED 

372
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:48,987
OF.

373
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:50,122
HE NOTED THE IRONY.

374
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,391
THERE IS A CONTRAST HERE.

375
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,159
ONE SIGNIFICANT THING HERE THAT 

376
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,094
YOU MIGHT SAY HE HAS IN COMMON 

377
00:14:56,094 --> 00:14:57,829
IS NO REAL ADMISSION OF DOING 

378
00:14:57,829 --> 00:14:58,998
ANYTHING WRONG.

379
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,799
THE PRESIDENT ADAMANTLY INSISTS 

380
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,700
HE DID NOTHING WRONG, CALLED 

381
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,636
THAT "ACCESS HOLLYWOOD "TAPE 

382
00:15:04,636 --> 00:15:06,538
LOCKER ROOM TALK.

383
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:09,742
ROY MOORE IS DENYING NOW THAT HE

384
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,311
DID ANYTHING WRONG IN TERMS OF 

385
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:13,178
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT TOWARD 

386
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:14,079
UNDERAGE GIRLS. 

387
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,915
>> ALSO OUR SENIOR NATIONAL 

388
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:18,016
CORRESPONDENT HAS BEEN IN 

389
00:15:18,016 --> 00:15:19,784
ALABAMA THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS 

390
00:15:19,784 --> 00:15:20,351
COVERING THIS CAMPAIGN.

391
00:15:20,351 --> 00:15:21,519
THIS WILL BE AN INTERESTING 

392
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,688
MOMENT AS THIS ELECTION COMES UP

393
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:23,155
ON TUESDAY.

394
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:24,923
AS JOHN POINTED OUT, ROY MOORE 

395
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:25,890
AND THE PRESIDENT SIMPLY 

396
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,759
ABSOLUTELY DENY IN THE FACE OF 

397
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,027
SEVERAL WOMEN ACCUSERS, AS WELL 

398
00:15:29,027 --> 00:15:30,762
AS -- AND ONE OF THE THINGS 

399
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:32,798
WE'VE SEEN IS A SHIFT AMONG THE 

400
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:33,265
REPUBLICAN SENATORS.

401
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,666
THEY STARTED OUT SAYING, ROY 

402
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,268
MOORE HAS TO GET OUT OF THE 

403
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:36,468
RACE.

404
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:37,469
THERE IS NO WAY HE CAN SERVE.

405
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:38,937
THEY'RE STARTING TO COME AROUND 

406
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:39,938
TO THE IDEA HE IS GOING TO BE 

407
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:40,205
SERVING. 

408
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:41,873
>> I THINK IT'LL BE BIGGER THAN 

409
00:15:41,873 --> 00:15:42,340
THE SENATE.

410
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,209
THE RACE IN ALABAMA GOT SO MUCH 

411
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:44,442
BIGGER.

412
00:15:44,442 --> 00:15:47,246
IF ROY MOORE WINS, A MAN ACCUSED

413
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,148
OF SEXUALLY INAPPROPRIATE 

414
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:49,847
BEHAVIOR WITH EIGHT WOMEN, 

415
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:51,416
ALMOST ALL OF THEM TEENAGERS, 

416
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,752
AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTING TWO -- 

417
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:56,021
HE HAS DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS --

418
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,489
BUT IF HE WINS THE RACE, HE GOES

419
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:58,624
TO THE U.S. SENATE.

420
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,758
EVERY REPUBLICAN UP FOR ELECTION

421
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:00,826
IS GOING TO BE ASKED THE SAME 

422
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,160
QUESTION, DO YOU STAND WITH ROY 

423
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,594
MOORE?

424
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:03,695
THIS IS A VERY BIG ISSUE.

425
00:16:03,695 --> 00:16:04,963
THE NEWS CYCLE MOVES SO FAST 

426
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:05,431

427
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,165
BUT THIS ISSUE HAS PROVEN NOT TO

428
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,232
GO AWAY.

429
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:09,634
THE MID-TERMS, ONLY 11 MONTHS 

430
00:16:09,634 --> 00:16:10,035
AWAY. 

431
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,104
>> LIKELY HE WILL END UP IN THE 

432
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:12,871
SENATE.

433
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:16,208

434
