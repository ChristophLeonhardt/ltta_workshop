00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> came through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this corridor and this</font>

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,200

helping me with this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I looked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,400
the corner and I'm gonna be from there

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,730
and it's not gonna be filled up<font color="#E5E5E5"> though</font>

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:22,980
luckily imagine that I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> spoken in</font>

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,510
front of this a room this size before

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,400
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was rubbish at public speaking</font>

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,060
then and I'm gonna be<font color="#E5E5E5"> there that's a</font>

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,360
thursday after the conference<font color="#E5E5E5"> i did and</font>

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,870
what a great day it was I wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure to</font>

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,160
expect from it but I've definitely

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,170
learned a lot in terms of blended

16
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,480
learning and the all these different

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,700
projects that are going on and my big

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,480
mug shot is gonna be up<font color="#CCCCCC"> there oh yes and</font>

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,390

20
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,949
and Australia live yes I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> wondering</font>

21
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:02,219
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 differences in it let's stay</font>

22
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,400
enough so they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been eager geez the</font>

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,110
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people that came up to me and</font>

24
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,400
she the questions at the end there was

25
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,869
so much input I don't know how to

26
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:14,720
explain it because i always have

27
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,610
believed<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is such an underrated</font>

28
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,729
medium to help with education and many

29
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:23,549
other areas of<font color="#E5E5E5"> life but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think because</font>

30
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:26,250
a lot of these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that applauded me</font>

31
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,640
who are professors doctors and

32
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,530
specialists in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this field and have said</font>

33
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,540
such great things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

34
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">giving me the reassurance I need</font>

35
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,520
I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the speech which is a</font>

pretend i'm doing a video and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then that</font>

39
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,180
will fill up the 40 minutes pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

44
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,400
conference been talking primarily about

45
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,160
the use of web<font color="#CCCCCC"> two tools sighs I don't</font>

46
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,199
worry we're going to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> against</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> web</font>

47
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,240
tools are primarily anything that's

48
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,090
could controllable workable changeable

49
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,340
by the user so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> might be a blog</font>

50
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,740
or a facebook<font color="#CCCCCC"> account or if they're</font>

51
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,270
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we can't all like delicious</font>

52
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,500
which allows you to kind of carry around

53
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,200
your bookmarks and your resources<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

54
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,970
you like but the critical thing is that

55
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,010
their own their own by you you don't

56
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,540
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know web programming or anything</font>

57
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,090
you can build<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own stuff you can</font>

58
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,440
control it and you let other people see

59
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and critiquing you feedback and that</font>

60
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,360
kind of thing so bills networks and what

61
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,010
your goals in terms of how far do you

62
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,239
think you can go in the education system

63
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,830
and like what are the limitations of

64
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,360
stopping it from happening now because

65
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,340
we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tools now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but the balloons</font>

66
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">the limitations</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think around people's</font>

67
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:51,420
mindsets you know in terms of what how

68
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,830
they think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that those tools should be</font>

69
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">deployed to support students and support</font>

70
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,330
learning primary<font color="#CCCCCC"> mukherjee and we still</font>

71
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,489
have this obsession with lectures and

72
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:02,310
seminars and essays and exams and it

73
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,510
locks it into particular ways of

74
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,280
thinking you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know yet these are the</font>

75
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,620
tools allow the participation allow us

76
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,910
to kind of work with other people

77
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,700
outside universe is again you know talk

78
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,620
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them about their worldview about what</font>

79
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,140
they think about bits of content or

80
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,570
ideas or the outset<font color="#E5E5E5"> aware and it allows</font>

81
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">to bring those things back in</font>

82
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:21,989
custom you know so some all abstracts

83
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:23,790
intelligence I think it is you know

84
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,650
pretty allows us to connecting kind of

85
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,209
more emotional ways as well you know

86
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:28,980
these thoughts hello you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> allowing</font>

87
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,040
to talk to you about politics or citizen

88
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,989
participation yeah or taking action you

89
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:35,849
know well we never<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about those in</font>

90
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,950
higher education<font color="#CCCCCC"> function yeah because</font>

91
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,810
because we should be trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work with</font>

92
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">our students and ourselves of stuff you</font>

93
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,909
know tomato wolf but place is about life

94
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:47,040
it is that why it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> about education</font>

95
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,930
in your little box<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's how do you</font>

96
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,480
employ out there in the lecture I gave I

97
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,280
discussed the many skills I had obtained

98
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,250
from blogging over the past two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

99
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,359
proposed how I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

100
00:03:57,359 --> 00:03:59,939
education system could benefit so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

101
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,829
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> blogging was to be implemented into</font>

102
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:04,949
the system now our key elements all this

103
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:07,049
is how I began blogging and what

104
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:08,879
attracts me to the idea of broadcasting

105
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,739
yourself to the world I of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

106
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:13,919
mentioned how Peters geriatric 1927 s

107
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,228
first video gave me the first push and

108
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:18,329
how the video responses people posted to

109
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,488
that made me realize we all have a

110
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:22,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">chance to be heard I thought you know</font>

111
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:26,310
can I be mad I'll give it a<font color="#CCCCCC"> go so surfer</font>

112
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,789
camera video is uploaded it and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

113
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:32,849
within 24 hours we've got about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 years</font>

114
00:04:32,849 --> 00:04:35,550
but compared<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> without me</font>

115
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,169
doing it that was a step up we'd all

116
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:40,080
agree and i had about 1 or 2 comments

117
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,759
that people who said interesting views

118
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,610
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other discussion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with comments</font>

119
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,639
and that was the star now two<font color="#E5E5E5"> years on</font>

120
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,889
I've obtained over<font color="#CCCCCC"> thirteen and a half</font>

121
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,780
thousand subscribers I've had over

122
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,199
almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> four million views and it has</font>

123
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">given me so many opportunities in life</font>

124
00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:01,139
like what I'm doing here today and it

125
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,419
has made me evolve as a person now this

126
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:05,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">is I'm very passionate about and the</font>

127
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,389
reason I'm here today is to talk about

128
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">how it can help the education system</font>

129
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,580
because if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything can help develop us</font>

130
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,969
those individuals as as people we should

131
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:15,330
use

132
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,270
any medium we can as possible and I

133
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,560
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> just from doing stuff like this</font>

134
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,360
it's really nice to sort of use my

135
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">passion in a constructive sense because</font>

136
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,379
it's all I've ever wanted to do and I've

137
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:28,259
had to really self motivate such things

138
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,419
you know on<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube of all the projects</font>

139
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:31,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">that do it's because I really really</font>

140
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,289
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the message out there and</font>

141
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:36,990
you know is paying off now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want</font>

142
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,789
to say that the thing about looking that

143
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:41,159
feels to me the most is some people tend

144
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,870
to disagree and that's fair enough I

145
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,659
work in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a discussion later and is that I</font>

146
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:47,699
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's one of the purest forms of</font>

147
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:49,440
creativity now what do I mean by that

148
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,719
now the purest all the creativity is the

149
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:53,460
fact that you take anything that song

150
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,319
might do they might like to report news

151
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,270
articles they might going to play in a

152
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,900
band they may do art or they've made

153
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,310
like to speak about philosophy or

154
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,500
politics now all these elements can be

155
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,440
incorporated into a video you can use

156
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,400
bits of everything we can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one</font>

157
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,069
and a site like YouTube gives you the

158
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:18,210
ability to push all this out there and

159
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,310
to see if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow other people on</font>

160
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,349
the same wavelength so it allows to show

00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,840
you like this now i'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to show</font>

163
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:30,509
years ago and you will see how I've

164
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:33,229
actually changed

165
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:42,309
hey everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> those miles has a lot of</font>

much already you can see I'm slouch in

170
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:55,089
I'm help looking at the camera

171
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:57,999
completely and there's lots of

172
00:06:57,999 --> 00:06:59,529
confidence I mean it takes a degree of

173
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:02,169
confidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself out there I</font>

174
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:04,179
was you know it's all about they're not

175
00:07:04,179 --> 00:07:06,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure about it now I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> processor two</font>

176
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:11,799
years I've managed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go from plug into</font>

177
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:16,389
going to events last year in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> summer</font>

178
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:18,009
I went to America where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

179
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:19,419
stayed around the homes of people who

180
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:20,860
watch my videos know many people think

181
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,219
as crazy there's a lot of negative media

182
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:26,799
in the needs but I believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

183
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:28,860
the people who put themselves out there

184
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,449
they do it in hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that other people</font>

185
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:35,110
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be treating themselves so from that</font>

186
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,939
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> become speaker</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at gatherings</font>

187
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:38,799
organizers government what people in the

188
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:41,139
online community came together which I

189
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:43,029
believe signifies and symbolizes the

190
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,139
fact that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know these are real people</font>

191
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:47,379
with real lives and furthermore it is

192
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:51,369
led to television I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're on vine and</font>

193
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:53,739
I come from a wonderful city it's a

194
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,349
Calgary Alberta but miles just in terms

195
00:07:56,349 --> 00:07:57,969
of context<font color="#E5E5E5"> I work for both the</font>

196
00:07:57,969 --> 00:08:00,069
University of Calgary and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a college</font>

197
00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:01,749
that's just in the process of becoming a

198
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:03,789
university right certainly hertfordshire

199
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:06,610
get a while ago and valued idea no it's

200
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">over in Calgary so you just come out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

201
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:10,209
specialist just unhealthy here as<font color="#E5E5E5"> miles</font>

202
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:11,679
again just as you mentioned your

203
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:13,200
presentation it's been fast

204
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been involved</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with this conference</font>

205
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,130
for three years now yes so the first

206
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,470
year I even get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> come is we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just did</font>

207
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,140
my session using technology which<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

208
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,210
wonderful<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you don't get any sense of</font>

209
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,010
community and again as mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> miles</font>

210
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,590
earlier when am I it's been wonderful I

211
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,090
think the networking opportunities when

212
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,220
Syme here are great except physically

213
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,229
here but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we haven't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tapped into</font>

214
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:35,880
how we can create that sense of

215
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,380
community<font color="#CCCCCC"> with these sort of gatherings</font>

216
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,090
online yeah that's interesting because I

217
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,190
did you see the Second Life program

218
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,229
you're a better bike lane your little

219
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:45,060
bed basic always a favor<font color="#E5E5E5"> within this</font>

220
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">virtual world you go to classes you sit</font>

221
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,750
on that chair in a virtual world and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

222
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,760
think the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> people tend to</font>

223
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,640
misinterpret is as good as good as it is

224
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,470
a virtual world yep you need the

225
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,970
connection from virtual to real world

226
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">because if people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only learn to learn in</font>

227
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,710
a virtual world how they cope in the

228
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,690
outside world and the big thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

229
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,630
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your identity as a member of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

230
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">online community now online community is</font>

231
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,110
something which I can talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to switch</font>

232
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,270
from the health of the end of time but

233
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,980
it is the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason you to be</font>

234
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,830
so successful is the fact that it's not

235
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">just the website way on my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> videos is</font>

236
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,050
where people<font color="#E5E5E5"> can communicate and people</font>

237
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,000
can get their ideas together and there

238
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,380
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something sort of filling in the gaps</font>

239
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,180
because we need individual videos so in

240
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,280
terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Education it be bridging the</font>

241
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,260
gap between teachers and students which

242
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,630
tends to happen a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> lectures dr.</font>

243
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,340
Richard who actually places a blog about

244
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,350
my lecture and his views on it the

245
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,300
evening after I made it which is

246
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,010
available<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you go to the description</font>

247
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">box but he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was also happy to explain why</font>

248
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,570
my lecture appealed to him in the talk

249
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,250
we had the next day well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said it was</font>

250
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,960
so any time to come to conferences and

251
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,180
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear really really important stuff</font>

252
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,010
about in terms of how to improve

253
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,840
them in terms of students to work

254
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,150
together collaboratively or engagements

255
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,160
or lightning or whatever it might be

256
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,160
basically our experiences yeah and it's

257
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,780
not cooling student and I think that's

258
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,880
critical writing from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual person</font>

259
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,280
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> this thing is being done to you know</font>

260
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,140
ice and I think the critical thing about

261
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,500
what you what you use your blog for

262
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">really me is that your view of the world</font>

263
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,440
connecting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to other people and</font>

264
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,910
respecting their use and how that

265
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,340
changes your wealthier than have enabled

266
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,830
you to reflect writers / CA but also

267
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,170
then reflect on what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

268
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,640
curriculum you know I mean yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

269
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,440
thing it strikes me<font color="#E5E5E5"> from what you've</font>

270
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,570
thought about for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alec seeing you too</font>

271
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,060
can that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about your</font>

272
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,310
assessments oh um all around you where

273
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,930
you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> now I've done videos on stuff</font>

274
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,250
that I've actually learned in lectures

275
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,260
and discuss their an underlying basis

276
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,120
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm one of these links we got</font>

277
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,710
we got some really<font color="#E5E5E5"> great students who</font>

278
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,420
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that they will use</font>

279
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,420
myspace or they will use own YouTube in

280
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,980
order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> present their work tip feedback</font>

281
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,480
from other people who they trust you

282
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,010
know yeah just why why we're locking

283
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,990
ourselves into small groups known as a

284
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,400
world of information of other people

285
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,710
others in bed with and finally value

286
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,670
systems the fact knowing who you are

287
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,200
Stephanie discovering who you are and

288
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,060
what you have offer his education

289
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,910
process in learning tools and then being

290
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,190
able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use them in the outside world</font>

291
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">and already because just watching your</font>

292
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,390
presentation yesterday in that little

293
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,010
YouTube clip they have hope you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

294
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,720
Gordon Brown the<font color="#CCCCCC"> government suddenly</font>

295
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">decides you're going into what i find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

296
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,600
there was a fellow canadian marshall

297
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,250
mcluhan

298
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,840
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how we really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are shape</font>

299
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,850
these tools that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> two ways shaping</font>

300
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:37,310
us and what I find our generation is

301
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,800
trying to use these tools to change the

302
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,260
hottest practices right we r smiles

303
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,140
honestly for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you folks you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font>

304
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,180
that that baggage that we do the history

305
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,490
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be honest is totally natural I</font>

306
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,870
live in a world where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it used to be</font>

307
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,390
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> one version to version 3 and I</font>

308
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">still you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know my generation calls at</font>

309

web 2.0 s up they have a go with your

310
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,050
generation think of them even something

311
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,820
like Google or YouTube you ever hear

312
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,590
about YouTube bringing our version 12

313
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,810
you don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's just again</font>

314
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:08,000
that's made on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fly it's not suddenly</font>

315
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,770
okay we've got all these bugs now we

316
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,650
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wait and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as one is</font>

317
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly oh the next version</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the vle</font>

318
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">in version 3.5 or 300 that'll fix that</font>

319
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,250
bug but when you think of these social

320
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,170
networking applications<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't think</font>

321
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:24,050
facebook you two in any of them there's

322
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">never versions interest because it's an</font>

323
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,070
iterative process<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's based on that</font>

324
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,810
community feedback and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to think</font>

325
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,300
of again there's these the perp the

326
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,710
tools they're wonderful but at the end

327
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,760
of the day we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to remember there's</font>

328
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,810
people making a lot of money

329
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,930
appreciation on facebook but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

330
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,339
whole other group there is well a

331
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:42,920
community of sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source</font>

332
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,200
educational tools in terms of Voe is

333
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,960
being created there's some wonderful

334
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,660
they dim dim YZ can't remember all that

335
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,760
terminology but that's where<font color="#CCCCCC"> i find it's</font>

336
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,530
really fascinating because the community

337
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,720
is involved not only in terms of using

338
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,010
these tools for communication

339
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,870
opportunities but in terms<font color="#CCCCCC"> of revising</font>

340
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,150
and bridging them yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I guess what</font>

341
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,769
not even a metaphor is community

342
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:06,959
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's people's</font>

343
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,579
ideas coming together it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way the</font>

344
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,480
world should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> developing their</font>

345
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,029
education is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not about just teaching</font>

346
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:14,040
tools s about sharing and evening

347
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,869
blogging is perhaps the superior of all

348
00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:18,119
the web two point nine things I is

349
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:20,249
superior on the word<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm having my</font>

350
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:21,749
second point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to offer</font>

351
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:23,519
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of approach the students we</font>

352
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,170
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> does does this</font>

353
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,670
help you reflect on your work on

354
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">yourself this opportunity not restricted</font>

355
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,649
it if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be yeah and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sometimes</font>

356
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:33,029
people need to make more tools available

357
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:35,369
to our students and talk about how

358
00:13:35,369 --> 00:13:37,290
they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use say well you may</font>

359
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,970
good to see you can make a decision you

360
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,499
make a decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> about your own which</font>

361
00:13:40,499 --> 00:13:44,069
super monkey otay you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you probably</font>

362
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:46,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">know someone about without funny image</font>

363
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,519
or an allegory not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> another's do</font>

364
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,540
you take actually gonna buy that

365
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">newspaper what are they making decisions</font>

366
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,689
all the time if you make decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

367
00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:53,999
tools and power is a critical thing

368
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,369
Buicks bargain you know for being social

369
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,379
networking taught courses of courses you

370
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,610
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really powerful things that</font>

371
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use in mind but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think you know I've</font>

372
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,259
now been asked to do workshops all

373
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:05,939
around the country for universities and

374
00:14:05,939 --> 00:14:08,429
that and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I don't understand</font>

375
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:10,009
why youtube doesn't do this because

376
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:13,740
there's so much potential with people

377
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about their experiences</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

378
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:18,749
think that it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that YouTube don't</font>

379
00:14:18,749 --> 00:14:21,509
understand it they do understand it but

380
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:23,939
I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think they're investing</font>

381
00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:26,549
enough in the transfer from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> online</font>

382
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:28,499
community to the real world I mean they

383
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:29,939
invest a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> online</font>

384
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:33,329
community but it doesn't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> end there</font>

385
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:34,949
it's the fact that this can actually

386
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:38,279
revolutionize the world yeah I think so

387
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">thanks bro JS files and yeah</font>

388
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,910
Beyonce<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay there you thank you very</font>

389
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,279
much just<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were good yeah and</font>

390
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,320
something dr. Richard hull said was the

391
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,970
fact that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he will be all sort of</font>

392
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:54,279
enforcing the democracy into into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

393
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:56,320
world by giving everyone a voice which i

394
00:14:56,320 --> 00:00:00,000
think is such a great thing
