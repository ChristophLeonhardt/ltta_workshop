according to the rules of Hillary you
can take the baby at nine months and you
can imagine what you have to do to that
baby to get it out if you go with what
hillary is saying in the ninth month you
can take the baby and rip the baby out
of the womb of the mother just prior to
the birth of the baby now you can say
that that's okay
and Hillary can say that that's okay but
it's not okay with me according to the
rules of Hillary you can take the baby
at nine months and you can imagine what
you have to do to that baby to get it
out and you can take that baby at nine
months and you can abort mm-hmm and a
day prior to birth you could take the
baby and I said it's unacceptable
