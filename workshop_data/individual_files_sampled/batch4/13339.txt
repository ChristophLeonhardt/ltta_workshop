now it is time to put on my Stephen Colbert smart glasses and give the final thought for today's final thought I'm going to do the unthinkable I am going to defend Hollywood the horror the horror specifically I'm going to defend Darren Aronofsky's movie mother starring Jennifer Lawrence which I just saw yesterday I think I am the only conservative in the country who enjoyed mother right wingers have been excreting this film a writer a National Review called it the vilest film Hollywood has ever produced and the great John Nolte even said that it's an environmentalist anti-christian anti human screed now with respect to my friends in the conservative movement conservatives are Philistines and they have missed the rich narrative of this movie now Jennifer Lawrence and Aronofsky himself might misunderstand it too artists often get their own work wrong but the movie doesn't really make sense if Lawrence's character is seen as Mother Earth it makes much more sense if we realize that Jennifer Lawrence's character is Satan it is a mill Tony analogous for Christianity much like Paradise Lost now the movie is difficult to watch particularly its depiction of mankind and the Blessed Sacrament but that's the point the movie is told from the point of view of Jennifer Lawrence who is Satan a mother is a theological a serious movie that presents a thorough and disconcerting portrait of the insidiousness of sin and the unfathomable magnitude of God's love and inventiveness we have a sympathetic Satan character here just like we do in Paradise Lost and Mother's sympathy Jennifer Lawrence's characters sympathy for the devil should startle Christian audiences out of these sentimental complacency and shallowness that Aronofsky assails in his humans it's worth a watch you should go see yeah that's our show I'm Michael Knowles this is the Michael Noel's show come back tomorrow we'll do it all again
