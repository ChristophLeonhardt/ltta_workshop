THE V.A. SECRETARY WILL HAVE
HISS HEARING.
>>> BETWEEN PROTESTORS ATTACKING
SANDERS AND NELSON.
ALSO MELANIA TRUMP GETTING
SLAMMED FOR HER CLOTHING CHOSES
ARE WOMEN TWEETED DIFFERENTLY?
I HAVE A PANEL, GOOD MORNING
LADIES, THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH
US.
>> GOOD MORNING.
>> CANDACE IS THERE A DOUBLE
STANDARD?
>> OF COURSE THERE IS A DOUBLE
STANDARD.
IT'S INCOMPREHENSIVEBLE.
ANYONE WOULD ADMIT THAT WAS
WRONG.
I COULDN'T IMAGE THAT OBAMA'S
DAUGHTERS IS THREATENED WITH
PEDOPHILIA AND A MEMBER IS
KICKED OUT OF A RESTAURANT.
YOU WOULD NEVER HEAR THE END OF
THE CLAIMS OF RACISM.
IT SHOULD EVENT BE ALLOWED
BECAUSE IT'S DONALD TRUMP'S
ADMINISTRATION.
>> MY RESPONSE IS THERE ARE TWO
ISSUES HERE.
THERE IS A CIVILITY ISSUE.
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THROWN
OUT OF THE RESTAURANT.
WE DON'T DENY PEOPLE SERVICE.
WE CAN LEGALLY ON THE BASES OF
POLITICAL AFFILIATION.
THE OTHER SIDE TO THE ISSUE IS
THE FACT THAT REPUBLICAN WOMEN
HAVE THE SAME KIND OF CLOUT AS
WOMEN ON THE LEFT.
THE POLICIES OUT OF THE
ADMINISTRATION HURT THEM.
>> BUT WOMEN THAT WORK FOR THE
PRESIDENT WOULDN'T SAY THAT.
THEY WOULD SAY WE BELIEVE IN
THESE ISSUES.
>> YEAH, YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU
WANT THE STATISTICS DON'T LIE.
IF YOU RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE
TWO-THIRDS OF THOSE WORKING AT
MINIMUM WAGE ARE WOMEN.
>> PLEASE, I HATE THIS SELECTIVE
FEMINISM WE HERE ON THE LEFT.
DON'T MAKE THIS A FEMINISM ISSUE
BECAUSE IT'S NOT.
>> IT IS --
>> I'M NOT DONE.
YOU ARE NOT A FEMINIST.
YOU SIT HERE AND SAY YOU CARE
ABOUT MOTHERS, THE BASES OF THIS
IS PEOPLE ARE UPSET THAT ILLEGAL
IMMIGRANTS ARE BEING TAKEN AWAY
FROM THEIR MOTHERS.
WHY NOT PUT THIS INTERGOOD I --
ENERGY INTO BLACK COMMUNITIES.
THEY ARE SEPARATED FROM THEIR
FAMILIES ALL THE TIME.
THIS IS REALLY LOST ON ME.
IT'S TIMES UP ON THIS
ALTOGETHER.
THE BLACK COMMUNITY HAS HAD
ENOUGH OF YOU BEING SELECTIVELY
OUTRAGED.
IT'S BEEN HAPPENING FOR SIX
DECADES.
>> I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT
LET'S KEEP THIS CIVIL.
>> I BELIEVE I WAS KEEPING IT
CIVIL THEN CANDACE TOLD ME I
WASN'T A FEMINIST.
>> LADIES.
>> I SAID THE LEFT.
I DIDN'T SAY YOU, THE LEFT.
>> I DISAGREE.
I'LL DO THAT POLITELY.
I'LL RETURN TO MY ORIGINAL
ARGUMENT.
WE HEARD THIS FOUR YEARS THAT
KELLYANN AND OWL
KELLYANN AND AWL
KELLYANN AND ALL OF THE WOMEN
ARE NOT GETTING THEIR DUE.
THEY ARE ADVOCATING FOR POLICIES
THAT HURT WOMEN.
THEY KEEP THEM IN A BAD ECONOMIC
SYSTEM.
>> CAN I ASK YOU THIS?
WHAT ABOUT BLACK WOMEN.
>> DO YOU THINK NELSON SHOULD BE
TREATED THE WAY SHE DOES?
SHE WAS FORCED OUT OF THE
MEXICAN RESTAURANT.
DO YOU THINK THE WAY SHE'S BEEN
TREATED WAS FAIR.
>> I BELIEVE WHAT SHE DID IN
COMING OUT AND LYING ABOUT WHAT
THE POLICY DID AND THE HAVING TO
BACKTRACK --
>> THAT WASN'T MY QUESTION.
>> I THINK THAT PEOPLE SHOULD
HAVE CIVIL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT
IT AND HAVE EVER RIGHT TO COME
UP TO HERITABLE AND CALL HER OUT
ON HER LIES AND THIS
ADMINISTRATIONS LIES.
IF SHE LEAVES BECAUSE OF IT
THAT'S ON HER.
SHE SHOULD BE OPEN TO THAT
DIALOG.
>> CANDACE, VERY QUICKLY, THIS
IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE.
YOU SAID THE LEFT SHOULD STOP
THIS AND THIS WILL BE BE
THIS AND THIS WILL BE AE
THIS AND THIS WILL BE ALLOWED IN
THE ADMINISTRATIONS.
NO ONE TALKS ABOUT THE FATHERS
THAT ARE BEHIND BARS OR BURIED
ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO AND
BALTIMORE.
THIS IS OUT OUTRAGE AND I DON'T
UNDERSTAND IT.
>> WE'LL HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE.
>> HIS FATHER --
