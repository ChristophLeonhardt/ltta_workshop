the left never lets its myths die today hashtag Mike Brown trended on Twitter not because the assistant coach for the Golden State Warriors got a new contract no it's because Michael Brown you know st. Michael of the gentle giant admit died two years ago today which of course means the media have to rehash their utter lie that Brown was a wonderful gentle giant young man shot in cold blood by an evil white cop all the while shouting hands up don't shoot which of course is complete crap here's what you need to know first Michael Brown was a criminal he strong-armed robbed a convenience store moments before he was pulled over by Officer Darren Wilson along with his buddy Dorian Johnson but don't worry he was just an innocent young man minding his own business second Michael Brown attacked a police officer so after he was pulled over Brown leaned into Wilson's window and punched him in the face which typically is bad strategy if you don't want to have a run-in with the cops he then reached over to Wilson's gun and tried to grab it and then when the gun went off he took off and he ran third Brown charged a police officer after officer Wilson popped out of the car and told Brown freeze Brown decided you know it's a great idea I'm gonna turn around and charge the officer while shouting at him that he can't do anything to me turns out the officer could and shot him to death fourth Dorian Johnson Brown's thug best friend he lied Brown never said hands up don't shoot he never even held his hands up by both witness and forensic testimony he certainly didn't surrender at any point to the officer v members of the ferguson black community pressured witnesses to shut up or lie president obama maintained in the middle of all of this that quote this is not just an issue in Ferguson this is an issue for America there are problems and communities of color they're not just making these problems up except that the community of color in Ferguson actually did make it up they threatened witnesses who contradicted the narrative one witness told the cops that threats were actually made two other witnesses another admitted that witnesses were embellishing testimony 12 witnesses told the police that Wilson shot Brown from behind only one problem me didn't 6th the media tried to turn this incident racial there was no evidence whatsoever Wilson shot Brown for any other reason than the threat to his life but the Eric Holder racist Justice Department found there was no rationale for any sort of federal prosecution of Wilson seventh none of this matter the media decided the narrative of an innocent black man shot for no reason by white officer simply had to stand and then they justified the riots in Ferguson based on that lie oh bomb used it as an opportunity to push forward his racist agenda the black lives matter launched itself on the back of a lie and so here we are two years later and the left is still pushing its lies because after all the myth has to be created and it has to be created in a controversial episode to craft the perception that America is deeply divided on racial issues if they picked a different episode if they pick like laQuan McDonald for example we'd all agree so instead they picked a bad example on purpose and they did so because first they don't care about facts and second they need opposition in order to show that Americans are racist but you know facts actually do matter Michael Brown was a criminal who tried to kill a cop and the cop killed him instead I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show tends to demonize people who don't care about your feelings here we are it is a Tuesday and once again I am healthy and life is beautiful and it's a wonderful thing except of course for politics which continues to stink beyond all human imagine our political scenarios tend to be bad and now they've gotten even worse but today the big boo boos was Hillary's big boo boos so Donald Trump will talk about his economic speech the Trump nama clan in just a little while and we'll get to this massive conservative infighting that's now taking place in the media sector but we have to start off with Hillary Clinton making a giant giant boo-boo so today's Hillary Clinton giant giant boo-boo she was giving a rally in in Kissimmee Florida and you'll notice something in the tape that we're about to show you one of the people who's sitting behind her on stage is Sadiq Khan you'll recognize his face Sadiq Khan was the or or say yeah I think it's a I think his name is Sadiq Khan correct he was the the father of of Omar Mateen who was the shooter in the early is the Orlando jihadis it might be Sadiq Mateen I have to have to check the name but in any case he's he's sitting behind Hillary I guess everybody's looking around at this going wait wait hold on a second so the guy who shot 49 people in Orlando like five minutes away from where Hillary is giving this rally is sitting behind Hillary at the rally clapping for her oh yes it happened it's real Sadiq Mateen that is his name sitting directly behind Hillary Clinton grinning away like a crazy person Hillary Clinton speaking to a crowd in Kissimmee just south of Ward supposed to be talking jobs but started off paying tribute to those affected by the pulse nightclub shooting and I know how many people family members loved ones and friends are still grieving notice the man right behind Secretary Clinton with the mustache and wearing a red hat that's the father of the Orlando shooter what were you thinking when she was talking about the Orlando incident we've been helping and we were cooperating with federal government FBI that's about it Thank You Sadiq Mateen didn't want to answer any other questions anything sir no but just hours later by chance we ran into him at a rest stop on the way back to West Palm Beach Clinton is good for United State vs Donald Trump he wanted to do an interview and showed us a sign he made for Hillary Clinton so tell us why you wanted to stop and talk now well I feel like to tell you why I stopped to talk to you because very important for the United States of America especially the election I was invited by Democratic Party just like come come support Hillary just a regular chain email or a personal invitation so it came out I I'm a member so as I remember I get the invitation so it's nothing particular about it what went into your decision about going to this events right near Orlando where this post nightclub shooting happened I I was because I spoke a lot about that and I wish that my son joined the army and fought Isis and destroyed our say Isis that would be very much better did Hillary Clinton's campaign know that you were going to that event and sitting right directly behind her it's a democratic party so everybody can enjoy do you think that some people will be surprised to know and to see that you were there in Orlando or near Orlando what why why they should be surprised I love United State long time it's beyond Paradiso he wasn't specifically invited by the Hillary Clinton campaign but let's be clear about something one of the ways that you get to sit behind a candidate at these things they understand the cameras are shooting up at Hillary Clinton right so one of the ways you get to sit behind the cans in it at events like this is the campaign picks who in the crowd they want to sit behind Hillary Clinton and it's always the United Colors of Benetton right it's always it's always a bunch of people from various countries who look very different and it looks like a diversity brochure from the local University they always find the black people and if I'm brown people in the Asian people and they stagger them in the backgrounds that it looks like people of all colors shapes and sizes support Hillary apparently terrorists father's support Hillary - so he's they stick him up there because diversity matters to the Democrats right that's the reason why he's up there the reason he's up there is because he's a brown guy who looks brown and he's got a mustache and he looks like Saddam Hussein and he's sitting up there you know behind Hillary Clinton because he's supposed to add diversity to the photo only later does it occur to them oh yeah that's a guy who says that he likes the Taliban and that gay people will be punished by God and whose son murdered 49 people five minutes from here so that's kind of awkward that's kind of weird it does go to the idea that and when Hillary Clinton says that she's going to keep us safe it's like darlin you can't even keep your stage safe from like really he's the JV team and he's sitting there behind you he's not a security threat to Hillary Clinton but I mean his son did murder 49 people it doesn't seem like the world's smartest idea so this idea that she's going to be really safe on immigration if she's gonna vet all of the various refugees who are coming in all over the United States that she's gonna that she's gonna vet all the Muslim refugees we can trust her with our security obviously that's untrue and it's still you know the media are not paying any attention to this of course so the media went absolutely bonkers over the over the fact that Donald Trump one of his delegates at the RNC was a white supremacist you remember this is tons of reports about this sort of thing and they asked Donald Trump one proximately one thousand times about support from David Duke in the KKK and Donald Trump memorably got one of those very egregiously wrong and that's a question you have to get right a hundred percent of the time will anybody ask Hillary about this well anybody ask Hillary I mean first of all she doesn't do press conferences but will anybody ask Hillary Clinton why is it a guy who says gays will be punished and the Taliban ought to win is sitting behind you at one of your rallies like how did that happen who's getting fired for that that question will never be asked they'll just they'll brush it off they'll say oh well you know anybody can sit anywhere no big deal yeah because that's the way than the media operate here but that doesn't mean that that Hillary Clinton is off the hook it just means that she's able to get away with more so in other bad Hillary news the State Department was asked about the fact that as we discussed yesterday Hillary Clinton had two emails on her private server in which the the Iranian spy who was just hangs in Iran he was openly discussed and called our friend in in her email server and so there was speculation on based speculation because we don't have evidence of this yet that the Iranians may have hacked her server and that's how they found out that this guy was a spy unlikely the likely answer is that they knew he was a spy and they threatened his family so he came back and then they hanged him but it's a question it's a decent question so somebody asks it to the State Department watch the State Department avoid answering these questions we're not going to comment on what may have led to this event but as we spoke about with Matt you know there was public reporting on this topic back in 2010 former Secretary Clinton discussed this issue in public at that time so this is not something that became public when the State Department released those emails okay so she says we're not gonna discuss it and then she goes on to justify Hillary Clinton but it's amazing that she won't just say Hillary's server wasn't hacked right wouldn't that be your normal answer when your normal answer be we have no evidence that Hillary Clinton's email was hacked but they can't say that because they don't know the answer because Hillary's email might well open nobody knows the answer to that including Hillary Clinton's own State Department but that's not stopping Hillary from campaigning she's going after Donald Trump and she's winning I mean right now the polls are very very bad for Donald Trump he's down anywhere from 10 to 15 points in most of the major national polls he's now running behind in Georgia he's running behind in Arizona he's running about even in North Carolina and these are not good polls for Donald Trump I mean these this and what we'll discuss the ramifications all for all of this for the Republican Party and what it means for the future in a little while but Hillary knows that she doesn't have to defend herself this is the beauty of being a Democrat and Trump had to know this going in we all had to know this going in there is not gonna be any fairness from media we're never gonna cover Hillary scandals they were never gonna cover the fact that yesterday to Benghazi families actually sued Hillary Clinton for wrongful death in Benghazi they're not gonna cover that can you imagine can you elaborate has there been of the Trump University lawsuit this one that's going down in San Diego tons and tons of media coverage forget what you think about Trump University whether you think it's a scam or whether you think it's real the media coverage on it's been extraordinarily heavy and part of that is because Trump talks about it but part of it is because the media covered these sorts of things they cover all of his lawsuit Hillary Clinton just had a lawsuit filed against her for wrongful death of American cities in Benghazi Libya and you can't find that story anywhere but on Fox News so yes the media are out to get Trump and they're out to defend Hillary which frees up Hillary to go on the offensive so here is Hillary yesterday going up a going going after Donald Trump and saying that he's a bad mean terrible man and don't be fooled there is no other Donald Trump what-you-see-is-what-you-get he is still the same Donald Trump who makes his shirts and his ties overseas instead of in the United States he is the same Donald Trump who refuses to pay his bills for small businesses and working people and in fact he is the same person who can be provoked by a tweet and who takes a parent's pleasure in tormenting protesters at his rallies a reporter with a tough question even a crying baby and a gold star family okay so we can stop it this oh so Hillary Clinton goes after Trump note two things to note about this Hillary Clinton's campaign is an absolutely plotting campaign just plods forward step after step after step there's no surprises there's no shocks there's no there's no color into this campaign it's an absolutely boring campaign that's why she's winning she's winning right now because she's letting Trump hang himself she's letting Trump just do what he's gonna do now if Trump shuts it down if Trump actually gets back on message then presumably Hillary may actually have to may have to do something because if she's playing with a lead and playing defensively and Trump gets aggressive with her then maybe this a little bit of race although it's getting very late in the day there's a report today that Donald Trump has taken out zero dollars in added time zero dollars in ad time Hillary Clinton is taking out fifty seven million dollars in advertising time that's that's not good by the Trump campaign again if you want Trump to win then you have to be looking at him at this point in saying dude you have to start running a professional campaign at some point in here but I just want to know that that when Trump complains about the media it's not all false so you heard Hillary Clinton say you know he's bullying a crying baby we talked about this last week it was just a funny situation right it was just it was goofy it was ten a typical Trump it was funny the mama the crying baby is now on the media and she's saying why is this an issue it was kind of hilarious I wouldn't be just been like blushing I would have I don't know what I would have done what did you say I'm sure my face was probably five shades of red like yeah well it was it was even funnier because the whole crowd that was there turned around also with him and they were all looking at me and we were just laughing because they're all going oh what a beautiful baby and you know it was just so funny because they were just going right along with them and the whole crowd was like totally engaged so it was it was hilarious and so okay so it was hilarious but that sound how the media covered it there's an actual think piece and a long think piece about all the terrible terrible things that Donald Trump had done to this to this poor little baby if it's just come on they come on I mean this is this is silly talk now this isn't to say that the Donald Trump is is is a a standard bearer for conservatism we're gonna talk about that in a minute we're gonna go through his economic speech which i think is kind of important because some it's important to actually mention his policy here and we'll do a little bit of good good Trump bad Trump but unfortunately we're at the end of our live feed so if you want to see the good Trump bad Trump and and you want to hear us talk about this new this new candidate Eric McMuffin Eric McMullen I think your McMuffin and if you want to hear us talk about the things I like the things I hate and it's a very rich episode of things I hate go to daily wired.com and you can subscribe for eight dollars a month you stingy bastards just pay out the money and

gonna want to join the fight and join the team daily wired.com to become a subscriber Cowabunga dude all right so we're back and here's the thing so it's time for some good Trump bad Trump so Trump yesterday had a pretty good day not externally externally he had a very bad day there were these 50 national security experts who couldn't be bothered to say anything in the primaries but now the Trump is the nominee now they come out and they say they don't like Trump Susan Collins he's the senator from Maine she says she doesn't like Trump there there are some you know kind of bad pieces of news the polling is bad for Trump but Trump himself had a good day because somebody took away his phone and hid it from him while he was in the bathroom and so he was incapable of tweeting out silly things until all you got if Trump yesterday was actually his economic speech and his economic speech was not terrible his economic speech I have to say our standards in this election have been lowered so much that what would be considered by any stretch of the imagination like a normal stump speech is now consider like yeah Donald you can do it we sort of treat Donald Trump as you candidate who had treat my two-year-old daughter when I take her swimming which is oh my you just swam 5 feet honey that's fantastic that's fantastic like at the very end I had to grab your hands and pull you out of the water she didn't drown but it was really really great that's sort of how we treat Trump as Cannes it hit unfortunately we treat him with these kind of kid gloves Oh Donald you read from a teleprompter and you didn't make any huge mistakes I mean you didn't make one mistake where he's you were trying to save the word cities and instead you said award that sounds like a strip club but but aside from that it was it was pretty good so we'll do a little bit rump bad Trump here we'll start with as always good Trump so Trump still has his sense of humor which is good because he doesn't have much else in the polls so the speaking of Trump sense of humor I wish that this is what from people like a bathroom what people like about Trump is when he seems like he's having fun lately he just seems like he's bitter and angry at the world because the polls aren't going his way but when he's having fun up there then people tend to like him so here was how Donald Trump dealt with some protesters yesterday home ownership is that its lowest rate in 51 years pulling nebulae and from Jesus waiting thank you very much thank you I will say the Bernie Sanders people had far more energy and spirit I will say look at that like a contained response like you didn't actually call for them to be beaten up or dragged out by the feet and hung up and caned or anything like that was good that's really good and some of his other economic policy stuff was not bad either like for example here is Donald Trump talking about Detroit and what all the problems with Detroit some of this is good some of this is bad we'll explain what's good what's bad when we were governed by the America first policy Detroit was absolutely booming engineers builders laborers shippers and countless others went to work each day provided for their families and lived out totally lived out the American dream but for many living in this city that dream has long ago vanished when we abandoned the policy of America first we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own the skyscrapers went up in Beijing and many other cities around the world while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled right here in Detroit our roads and bridges fell into disrepair yet we found the money to resettle millions of refugees at taxpayer expense today Detroit has per capita income of under $15,000 about half of the national average 40% of the city's residents live in poverty over two and a half times the national average the unemployment rate is more than twice the national average half of all Detroit residents do not work Detroit tops the list of the most dangerous cities in terms of violent crime protestors yelling in the background we didn't stop it there for a second so what Trump is saying about how terrible Detroit is is absolutely true it's actually kind of amazing you know he I'll explain that his diagnosis here is wrong his his his answer actually his diagnosis is sort of correct that Detroit stinks is is probably his recommendation his prescription is totally wrong and I'll explain why in a second but when when you go to Detroit it's actually kind of fascinating I was in Detroit maybe a couple of years ago for a conference for Hillsdale College and I was supposed to do my morning radio show from Detroit so I had to drive over to the local Salem station where local Salem affiliate is located right on 8 Mile Road which of course is famous because of the Eminem film and if you drive along eight mile it's the it's the border between two counties it's the board between Wayne County and Detroit County it's the it's the border between the the Detroit City proper and then the suburbs and it's like legitimately a dividing line it's where it's where one authoritative or 'ti begins and when you drive along this street what you see is on one side of the street you see nice buildings you see the radio station you see nice houses on the other side of the street literate legitimately on the other side of the street I swear to God on the other side of the street what you see is liquor store out of business shoe store liquor store tire store tattoo shop liquor store out of business tire store like that's what it looks like it's just for forever and occasionally a strip club that's that's legitimately what it looks like on the Detroit side of 8 mile and the reason that it looks that way is not because we're outsourcing jobs to China ok that's not why the reason it looks that way is because what happened in Detroit is that the government in Detroit decided that it would be worthwhile to tax everybody out of existence and everybody just moved into the suburbs so all the areas that are directly around Detroit are just fine Detroit itself has emptied out of every tax payer all the people who couldn't afford to leave are still stuck there but the taxes are high so nobody's coming back in and building businesses the only people who are left are people who don't have jobs and the reason that they don't have jobs is because all the people who built the businesses have left so too many regulations too much taxation the union's like UAW absolutely destroyed the manufacturing base in Michigan because they signed all of these lucrative contracts with the auto manufacturers basically blackmailed them into it with the help of the federal government through the National Labor Relations Board and then it turns out that it's cheaper to manufacture somewhere else now what Trump does he goes on and in this net here's where he got into bad Trump of course Trump diagnoses the problem in Detroit not as a few problems that are that are deeply interrelated too much government intervention ISM too many social services provided by too much taxation there's no one left to pay the taxes so you actually have to try and force people to stay a few years ago the mayor of Detroit tried to actually say that if you wanted to work in the city of Detroit he wanted to pass a law that said if you had to work in the city of Detroit you had to live in the city of Detroit so you couldn't commute in he's trying to do that to try and get somebody to come in and pay all the massive taxes that he wanted everybody to pay instead of blaming it on the taxation instead of blaming it on the regulation and the unions and blaming it on the the incredible social services that the city government kept voting that we're never gonna come to fruition because there was no one to pay the taxes instead of actually telling the true story of Detroit in other words Donald Trump tells a fake story and the fake story that Donald Trump tells is that we basically let all of these companies let them write it's a free country they should be able to do it they want we let them take their jobs and move them to Mexico and that's why nobody in Michigan has job anymore here's Donald Trump talking about trade and making basically that case because my only interest is the American people I have previously laid out a detailed seven-point plan for trade reform available on my website it includes strong protections against currency manipulation big problem tap and I want to explain to people what currency manipulation is and why he's talking about it so Donald Trump's suggestion is that when China inflates its currency it's destroying our manufacturing base the reason he says this is let's say that China has to pay its workers so what it does it inflates its currency it pays its workers more more of its currency but it means that the currency is worth less so basically I can now buy more from China theoretically because they've inflated their currency right my dollar is now worth more of their currency it's worth more again right or one I think is their currency it's what it's worth more one so I guess oh my dollars more for one I can buy more things there presumably this means that I can buy more labor there and I can outsource the only problem with this particular point of view is that it's not true currency manipulation doesn't do anything in the long term all currency manipulation does is destroy your savings rate in the country in which you're working right this is why Venezuela's had tremendous tremendous problems with inflating its currency and nobody is working there right everybody's unemployed buy more Germany used to inflate its currency all the way up to the point where people were obviously there pictures of the shovelling wheelbarrows around full of money that didn't make Vie my republic a hub for investment and made people feel unstable it made it feel like he couldn't invest there because who knew what the government was gonna do they were gonna start grabbing money any second so currency manipulation Mitt Romney's put focus on this too and it really is not it's not really a strong economic point if China manipulates its currency all they're doing is giving us a temporary advantage in our ability to hire their workers but those workers aren't presumably willing to work for cheaper anyway because again those workers still have to eat and they have to spend their wan on other food to pay for the food so we can't it doesn't work this way in other words they put it in short Donald Trump's vision of currency manipulation is not really a relevant one it's not economically literate okay we can continue F's against any countries that cheat by unfairly subsidizing their goods and it includes a total renegotiation of NAFTA which is a disaster for our country hey total he talks about what you were selling these bad deals and NAFTA's a disaster for the country and TPP is a disaster for the country okay there's a case against TPP the case against TPP the trans-pacific partnership is it as a case against giving President Obama what we call free trade Authority FTA the reason that we don't want to give Obama free trade Authority is because that basically pre signs away Congress's ability to look at any trade deal he negotiates trade promotion Authority TPA right that's that's what it's called so if is so the reason we don't want to give that to Obama is because he could negotiate a climate change deal under the guise of a trade deal and then Ram it down our throats that's the real reason that conservatives many of them are opposed to the trans-pacific partnership deal we don't even know what's in it but NAFTA you know the TPP in principle the idea of free trade agreements in principle Trump is against those in principle this is stupid the idea that free trade is what destroyed the domestic auto industry is just not true what's destroyed the domestic auto industry and I've written a full monograph on this well it destroyed the domestic auto industry in the United States was heavy government subsidies for years followed by massive unionization and bad deals which drove up the cost of labor and because the United States had was subsidizing the auto industry they could afford to pay all of these high wages to to the various auto workers and then we opened up our markets because it turned out that people were sick of paying twice what they ought to pay for a car because the cars in the 1970s look at American cars in the 1970s they suck the reason they suck is because they'd been subsidized we open up our markets and immediately Asian cars started pouring into the United States and taking up market share so at that point the American auto industry started to go under right Chrysler declared its first bankruptcy in the 80s so I think for declared bankruptcy at that point to the the idea is that you have to that way you actually have to do is open all of the markets and then ensure that American business is the most competitive they have to actually did this when they have to actually saved jobs in the car business the reason they have to save jobs in the car business is because if we did not allow if we weren't able to allow our car companies to compete in the global marketplace then they wouldn't have any of the room being place for us to sell those cars look it sells some of them in America but they'd be really really expensive people would buy the foreign cars anyway because they're better and then all those domestic car jobs would just go away what happened in NAFTA is we shipped a lot of the kind of low-rent manufacturing jobs from places like Michigan all the way down to Mexico but what that also allowed is for the car manufacturer to locate other plants in places in the United States that weren't heavily unionized like down south in Mississippi right Mississippi's seen a booming car industry because of NAFTA because now that we can have jobs down in Mexico it makes it cheaper for the car companies to manufacture the components in the United States because now you're in a geographically similar territory if it hadn't been for NAFTA all that would have happened is that companies like American companies they would just go overseas to Korea and Japan and Vietnam and China and they would manufacture an American cars overseas they wouldn't be American cars anymore this is why it's funny when I was younger I used to only buy American cars I don't do that anymore I've bought Honda's and the reason is because a lot of the Honda that you drive is actually made in America and a lot of the Ford that you drive is made somewhere else because of globalization ok the Trump says that it's it's free trade that's really destroying all these jobs the fact is all of the cool things that you have are basically due to free trade and if you put tariffs on cars coming in and if you tariffs companies that if you tariffs countries that subsidize their their domestic entries their domestic industries all you're doing is punishing the American consumer look at China wants to subsidize its car industry that just means it's cheaper for me to buy a car good now I can spend my money on industries that are super duper competitive in America like for example the burgeoning technology industry right we can use it on the service industry in the United States the nice thing about economics is that it follows the consumer it's my job to decide what is the best buying decision it's not Donald Trump's job to decide what's the best stop buying decision because I buy based on what I need for my family and nobody has the right to interfere with that nobody has the right to interfere with that okay so you know then he continues and then he gets to the good part of his speech so this is the kind of Bernie Sanders Democrat part of the speech then he gets to the actual good part of Trump anomic which is sort of the supply-side half the free-market half of Trump economics here is Donald Trump ripping into Hillary Clinton every policy that has failed the city and so many others is a policy supported by Hillary Clinton she supports the high taxes and radical regulation that forced jobs out of your community and the crime policies have made you far far less safe and the immigration policies that have stirred local budgets and the trade deals like NAFTA signed by her husband that have shipped your jobs to Mexico and other countries and she supports the education policies that deny your students choice freedom and opportunity everything he says right there everything he says there with the exception of the NAFTA nonsense is true right the Democrats support crappy education policy that keeps kids trapped in failing schools in inner city Detroit they support all of the crime policies that make Detroit a haven for crime and ensure that nobody can invest you really want to have investment in inner cities folks what you actually need is a low crime area nobody's gonna take their company's money and put it in an area where they are afraid that the the business is gonna get robbed every couple of days it's just not how things work so Trump is right about this and then Trump talks about tax reform and this of course is also good stuff I am proposing an across-the-board income tax reduction especially for middle-income Americans this will lead to millions of new and really good paying jobs the rich will pay their fair share but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs or undermines our ability as a nation to compete as part of this reform we will eliminate the carried interest deduction thank you as part of this reform we will eliminate the carried interest deduction well known deduction and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street investors and for people like me but unfair to American workers there so what now he's again the problem with trumpism is that it mixes up a lot of good stuff with a lot of silly stuff so when Trump says we have to lower tax rates obviously that's true but at the same time when he says that the rich will pay their fair share okay the top 1% of income earners in the United States are paying nearly half of all income taxes in America they're paying 46 percent of all income tax in America the top 1% are paying 46 percent of all income tax in America they're paying their fair share and they're paying more than their fair share the top 20% are paying 84 percent of all federal income tax whenever we talk about middle income Americans are burying the tax burden they are absolutely not bearing the tax burden the people bearing the tax burden are the people at the top of the economic echelon okay and it's not close it's by far it's by far when he talks about the carry to income loophole and what he's talking about the carried in the carried interest loophole what he's talking about is a way that that financial firms reward hedge fund partners basically if they do a good job if your general partner of a private investment fund and you get income that flows to you as the general partner of a private investment fund it's treated as capital gains your bonus gets treated as capital gains instead of his income he says that this is terrible thing I don't think it really matters much you know it's it's it's sort of a it's a throwaway line that pleases people who are anti Wall Street the fact is that the tax system should be significantly simpler just get rid of all deductions and have a lower tax rate are you skippered of all deductions then you don't have to keep your receipts and you don't have to worry about what does the government think is worthwhile and what does the government think is not worthwhile either have a single flat rate right like Steve Forbes said or have a national sales tax as neil bortz once proposed that what he called the fair tax but the way the tax system works as a whole is a joke but what Trump is proposing here generally is not bad stuff at all so the wall street journal' even is is pleased with this which is kind of a shocker Wall Street Journal's Daniel Henninger he says that trumps speech about the economy was was quite good I think this was the first important step in a big uphill comeback for Donald Trump the question now is whether he will stay on message whether he'll go around the country basically repeating this speech giving people some hope giving the details of his economic plan simplifying the tax code down to three basic rates lowering the corporate gains rate eliminating the death tax requiring regulators to justify federal regulations I mean these are things that will appeal both to families as he said I think to small businessmen and as well as to some of the corporate types who've been having their doubts about mr. Trump Donald Trump's going to try to overcome all that with the strength of his message that message today that he gave in Detroit is a very strong one and I think if he keeps pushing it he will at least be able to compete and perhaps start narrowing the gap in the polls okay so what he's saying here is I think not completely false I think that if Trump stays on message obviously he's gonna have a much better shot at winning than if he then if he gets off message the part by the way of Daniel Henninger here is being played by John Wood from wargames but in any case the the the fact that you know he's the fact that the Trump is on message about the economy I think is a positive for the Trump campaign is it enough I don't think it's enough the reason I don't think it's enough is because again all of Trump's economics are infused with the basic idea that the economy is rigged against you okay the economy is not rigged against you free trade is not rigged against you it turns out that most obstacles in life are overcome a ball if you work hard enough I really believe this I really think that this is the case especially in a free country at least this is the case free trade is a form of freedom if you don't like competition in the global marketplace that's your problem it's not mine as a consumer and it's not mine as a worker and the idea that the Donald Trump is gonna come in and he's gonna lie to you and he's going to and he's going to make America great again by pushing all of these regulations on the ability to trade that's foolishness that said his tax policy is just fine but it's the merger of the two that so that's sort of troubling Peter Nalin is this guy who's running against Paul Ryan in in Wisconsin and he's gonna lose I think the vote is today and he's gonna lose badly but Peter Nalin he goes after Paul Ryan he why because he's a globalist and this is the word that you've heard a lot globalist here's Peter Nayland doing exactly that say that's got a simple questionnaire both sides they lean on this you think Republicans are clean no a race you know no one cheap absolutely not yeah absolutely not there is a group of Democrats and a group of Republicans that are absolutely working together against the American people they want cheap labor in here because that's what their donors want I called Paul Ryan the head of the soulless snake global snake because Paul Ryan wants cheap labor in this country Chris there's five point five billion people in this in this in this world that make less than the average Mexican worker what are we gonna do we're gonna open our doors to five point five okay see this is this is one of the things that annoys me about Trump nominee in plication that if you want free trade that you must want everyone to illegally immigrate to the United States and so people use the word globalist like that's what it means that's not what globalist means global globalist means you want international institutions to rule the United States right you want the UN to tell us what to do okay that's not what free trade is free trade is no one telling us what to do and certainly our government not telling us as individuals what to do it's the conflation of these two things the Free Trade & globalism that really irks me when it comes to economics okay so in other news today there is a new supposedly never Trump candidate out make a quick point about never Trump never Trump is kind of two things there's there's what the media thinks never Trump is and then there are the people who declare themselves never Trump so what never Trump actually is is individuals who decide that they can't vote for Trump right people say I'm never Trump what they mean is I'm an individual who has said that I can't vote in good conscience for Donald Trump for a variety of reasons that I've explained a thousand times before you know all that said there's a group of people who are supposedly never Trump and their idea is we must stop Donald Trump from becoming president at all costs I don't I think this election is lost to conservatives no matter what happens so I I have no I'm certainly not gonna back Hillary Clinton and I have no interest in you know Verte Lee a tempting to sink Donald Trump with with another candidate that's not that's not my goal here my goal is to tell the truth across the board about all of these candidates one of the people that are throwing up is a guy named Eric McMuffin McMullen and McMuffin is it's a CIA former CIA agent that seems like a good solid conservative but I just want to point out one thing so here is McMullen he's he's now declared his candidacy for President of the United States he's eligible in like three states it's more like 20 but he's he's not gonna do any damage at all but here he is on TV last night talking about Donald Trump and why he's running he's already demonstrated that he doesn't respect them or their families his attacks on our American heroes like the Khan family and like John McCain this is somebody that we cannot trust the lives of those who are already risking their their lives too he is he is inhuman Donald Trump does not care about anyone other than himself okay so he's going after Trump really hard obviously and then trish regan asks mcmuffin are you okay with hillary clinton picking Supreme Court judges are you okay then with Hillary Clinton getting elected are you okay attachments going higher of course listen the suggestion then is that that that I somehow would force her to win Donald Trump is losing badly already to Hillary I've just entered the race today he's doing terribly and he can't keep his foot out of his mouth and today but you just heard Chris say you know look it's early there's still more than 90 days to go and you know polls that it can be meaningless when you finally go to the Belle époque well I think yeah and there are polls are right now that suggest he is actually running quite tightly with her in some states the real say the thinking would be that you might pull away some of those votes there for tipping the favor to Hillary Clinton Donald Trump is losing badly now according to the polls according to the Real Clear Politics average poll even which is doesn't necessarily reflect the current situation and it still shows that he's quite a bit behind Donald Trump keeps saying terrible things that alienates large swaths of the politic of the of the population he's wholly unfit I think in fact he's dangerous to the country and by the way he is not a conservative the idea that Donald Trump is a conservative is a complete farce he is a con man who pretends to be a comparative well those are the big allegations for someone who doesn't want to see Hillary Clinton elected it okay this sort of argument annoys me that your your knowledge about Donald Trump and this is what's gonna get Hillary elected know it's gonna get Hillary elected is the fact that you idiots nominated Donald Trump in the first place and now he's getting absolutely destroyed by 15 points I will say that when it comes to Eric McMullen mcmuffin that it's it seems he one of the reasons he's not gonna go anywhere is because he doesn't know how to do this if you actually wanted to launch a campaign like this a common man campaign well you need to do is you need to go in there and actually not be so serious you actually need to go in there you need to say look I woke up that when they say why you run you say look I woke up this morning and this campaign was not just a dumpster fire it was a dumpster fire atop a trash boat that was also on fire and was sinking into the middle of the of the dung infested ziko infested seas of rio that's what this election was and so I looked around and I thought can I do better this and I thought well yeah pretty much anybody can my dog can do better than this and yet everybody seems to chicken to actually get up there and say it so screw it I'm here and you know you want to vote for me vote for me you don't want to vote for me don't vote for me I'm a nobody that's the reason I'm running I'm running because I'm a nobody you have two somebodies and they both stink all right that's how that's how he actually should approach this but that's not how he's approaching it that's not how he's approaching this that never Trump is not gonna stop Trump okay the only thing that's gonna stop Trump is Trump Hillary Clinton is deeply vulnerable obviously she makes mistakes that are unbelievably gargantuan like having the father of a terrorist at one of her rallies - sitting behind her so that they're both visible in the photos it's just amazing stuff and if Trump had one iota of decency as a candidate then he'd be killing her in the polls and he should be killing her in the polls so this raises a final question before we get to things I like in things I hate and that is who's to blame for the rise of trumps there big battle has broken out everybody's looking at the polls right now and panic has set in and so here's the truth it's a little bit early for panic to sit in there's some new Quinnipiac polls that are out right now in Florida Hillary's up by one 46 45 in Ohio Hillary is up by three or four 49 to 45 in Pennsylvania Hillary is up by 10 52 to 42 so it's not a blowout in some of these states yet you know they're the polls show that she's obviously gained she's obviously doing well in some of these states but it's not a massive blow out yet but the panic is setting in anyway so some of the people who are panicking our big Trump supporters so Sean Hannity who's been supporting Trump for money since the primaries I mean clearly clearly Pro Trump has one online wag joked I wish that my wife looked at me the way that Sean Hannity looks at Donald Trump Sean Hannity a few days ago he he went off on all the people he's gonna blame if if Donald Trump loses seems Paul Ryan is and some of these other establishment Republican types have taken to the idea that they are gonna be true to what it means to be a Republican and I don't think is anything about Trump's agenda that's not conservative except maybe with the issue of trade you can argue on the issue of free trade but I think Trump's a free trader he just wants better trade deals and everything to him is a negotiation so you know as far as I'm concerned I feel like I'm gonna tell you one other thing I'm just gonna say it because it needs to be said if in 96 days Trump loses this election I am pointing the finger directly at people like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham and John McCain and John Kasich and Ted Cruz if he won't endorse and any of the jeb bush and everybody else that made promises they're not keeping and because i have watched and witnessed to the point of incredible frustration I have watched these Republicans be more harsh towards Donald Trump than they've ever been in standing up to Barack Obama and his radical agenda that has doubled the national debt that has resulted in a 51 year low in terms of homeownership in this country the percentage of homes that are owned by Americans that has led to the lowest labor participation rate since the 70s and that has led to millions and millions of millions more Americans in poverty and on food stamps and out of the labor force they did nothing nothing all these phony votes to repeal and replace Obamacare show votes so they can go back and keep their power and get reelected sorry you created Donald Trump all of you okay so he says his case is basically that the Republican Congress created Donald Trump there's merit to this there's merit to this the frustration that Republican voters feel with the Republican establishment for not doing enough to fight Barack Obama's amnesty and Obamacare that's justified here is the problem what Sean Hannity's solution was was to get behind the one guy who is not conservative on any of these issues and he's not I mean Trump is not a conservative he doesn't believe all of the things that we believe I'll play a tape in a moment showing you just this you know Donald Trump is is not any of the things that Hannity proposes to be if Sean Hannity actually thought that these were the big problems that he had with the Republican establishment I mean it's funny he's ripping into Ted Cruz for not endorsing Donald Trump and saying that these people didn't fight against Obamacare excuse me Ted Cruz was the guy who's filibustering Obamacare on the floor of the Senate Ted Cruz was the guy who was trying to shut down the government to stop Obamacare I know and don't give me this routine they're like lumping and Paul Ryan with Ted Cruz is just ridiculous so that's what's wrong with that argument so yes the Republican establishment bears a heavy burden of blame for the anger that led to the nomination of Donald Trump but there's another side to this and that other side is the reaction of some people like Sean Hannity was to go and get behind the guy who has no interest in pushing against the Republican establishment agenda he actually agrees with the Democrats on half this stuff okay so that's that's one side of this on the other side he got establishment folks like Bret Stevens over at The Wall Street Journal and he and Sean Hannity have been going at it tooth and nail over the past few days on Twitter he called breasts even called Sean I think the the dumbest man at Fox News and then Sean Hannity responded by calling Brett Stevens a dumbass with his head up his ass which was not the world's greatest response and so here's Brett Stevens talking about the Trump campaign this is the standard line of Trump side of the party that all of us who oppose him are just a bunch of elites who live in a nacelle a corridor in this bubble of unimaginable wealth I wish I had been born into an extremely wealthy New York real estate family and been given multimillion-dollar loans to get my start in life I started at the bottom like so so many of us did and to the extent that I've achieved anything I think it's on merit a lot of Americans feel the same way it's not a convincing argument and it's particularly not convincing when Trump is telling so many people who are at the bottom who are first-generation Americans who are trying to rise that he has a different vision it's not a vision of opportunity of of mobility it's basically increasingly a vision of the the privileges of a white ethnic bloc who he is speaking to and if the Republican Party becomes essentially the white party it is going to be the death of it not only for demographic reasons but for reasons of principle the party of Lincoln is a party of opportunity for everyone it's a party about the right to rise and mr. Trump unfortunately doesn't represent that view I can't look at a party if we capture that after his loss I think is the great okay so we can okay so Stevens just like Kennedy some of what Hannity said is true so what Stevens is saying is true now what he's saying about Trump doing this kind of math no nationalist routine there's a lot of truth to that there is a lot of truth to that here's where Stevens goes wrong and at the very end he drops the line right to rise whose slogan was that anybody remember as jeb Bush's slogan right so Jeb Bush was one of the reasons why people reacted with alacrity to Donald Trump because they felt like there's this Republican insider class it doesn't care about a lot of the grassroots issues right the people that Sean Hannity is talking about who are happy to cut a deal with the Democrats who don't care that much about illegal immigration or just looking for a way out of the issue who are who are looking to to increase illegal immigration in some cases and and who say that anybody who cares about this must be a xenophobe in a robe this sort of tension existed before Trump Trump was just the apotheosis of it the problem is that the answer from everybody seems to be like you've got handed now blaming Stephens for Trump and Trump and Stephens blaming Hannity for Trump the bottom line is that everyone picked the wrong vehicle everybody picked the wrong vehicle because the real Donald Trump is a man without core and a man without principle and that's gonna bare a rat that's gonna bear fruit beyond this election you know I mentioned that this is sort of the Republican dunkirk and it is because the fact is that right now Donald Trump is not running first second or third among people under the age of 30 he is running fourth among people under the age of 30 he's interning at nine percent behind Joel Stein and Gary Johnson hey that's a problem and it's a problem because those people are voting for the first time many of them and they're going keep voting the way they vote this time and if you go out there and you stump for a guy like Donald Trump regardless what your short-term reasons were you do that you break it you bought it and you know that's that's a problem I do think that it's worthwhile noting here for all the people who keep insisting that Donald Trump is some sort of great conservative there's a person who kind of five-minute video we won't play the whole thing just going and just the no commentary is just Trump on all the issues and you'll you'll see I mean he has contradicted himself I'm legitimately every issue he's ever talked about I'm the only one of the stages said we should not go into Iraq for you for invading Iraq yeah I guess so you know I wish it was I wish the first half it was done correctly he's an abortion I'm very pro-life I'm very pro-choice do you believe in punishment for abortion yes or no as a principle it has to be some form of punishment I am pro-choice in every respect no natural talent to be president she's very talented and she has a husband that I also like very much Hillary Clinton was the worst Secretary of State in the history of the United States Hillary Clinton how did she do a Secretary of State probably above and beyond everybody else let's say Hillary is president I think is a terrific woman I think she really works hard and I think she does a good job and I like her I will build the wall and Mexico is going to pay for it and they'll be happy to pay for it I'm not gonna pay for that good wall this guy used a filthy disgusting word on television and he should be ashamed of himself and he should apologize okay it's five minutes of Trump flip flopping all over the place the point here is not that Trump is worse than Hillary Clinton I don't think he is I think they're both horror shows and you'll make the decision on how you want to vote yourself but if this was your solution to your anger at the Republican establishment was to nominate a guy who five years ago ten years ago was legitimately saying he's more of a Democrat than a Republican on the issues that was a major mistake by everybody okay time for things I like in things I hate so we're doing sci-fi movies today and this week on things I like so there's a movie that came out and it didn't do well at the box office because the ad campaign for it was really flawed people thought the name of the movie was lived I repeat it wasn't it's called the edge of tomorrow this movie is terrific it's a really really good sci-fi flick basically the premise of the film is that Tom Hanks every Tom Hanks Tom Cruise every time he dies in this film he repeats the day but it's not just like a video game like it actually has a plot it actually moves forward and it's in there's an alien invasion and he for some reason every time he wakes up and he gets to replay the day and so can he defeat the aliens and he's helped out by Emily Blunt who's a wonderful actress the film is really really first-rate it's really good it's actually moving it's a very very good movie and and you should definitely check it out a lot of fun it's also Tom Cruise kind of it his best because he starts off the film as the press flack for the army and so he's basically playing Jerry Maguire and then they say ok we need everybody on the front lines and now you're a soldier and it's and it's kind of great in the sense that you see him turn from Jerry Maguire kind of a self-centered jerk into Jerry Maguire at the end of the film Tom Hanks is always best playing the self-centered jerk because probably in real life he's probably self-centered jerk so it makes perfect sense but he's in but he's very good in this film ok things that I hate so you know we keep hearing from the federal government see something say something anytime you see something that makes you suspicious that somebody is involved with jihadism then you have to you have to report it I'll commit Muhammad clock boy remember clock boy he brought a clock to school that looked exactly like a bomb because it was actually just he didn't invent a clock everybody kept saying nice clock the White House tweeted out a nice clock Achmed okay he legitimately took like a 1980s style clock took the back off the clock put it in a pencil box so it looked like a bomb and brought it to school and then the people there said hey that looks like a bomb and the police came and they checked it out and they briefly detained him and then they let him go and the White House invited him and he got some sort of internship at Facebook over all this crap because he didn't bend anything didn't do anything first of all the clock was invented a long time ago we don't need a new form of a clock but beyond that he certainly didn't invent one and the White House made a big deal out of him the whole thing was a joke the whole thing was a joke and people said it was racial profiling it wasn't racial profiling if I brought the device to school that looked exactly like a bomb and they took me outside class it wouldn't be because I look like an Arab guy it would be because I brought a device to school but some people are being pulled out of class now for biting a pop tart into the shape of a gun so that's a bunch of crap he's now suing his home town for civil rights violations so if you think that people are gonna keep reporting you know bad situations as they see them a good way to prevent that is to keep ensuring that people like Ahmed Mohammed are treated as grand heroes okay final thing that I hate today so this is just a horrifying story in a very possible way a mother who is 36 and her son who were 39 of New Mexico they have now been and they're gonna be put on trial for incest they want to risk everything to be together Maris is a mother of nine and she gave birth to Peterson when she was 16 years old and Monica Maris and her son Caleb Peterson she gave birth to Peterson when she was 16 years old who's adopted shortly afterward they're reunited for the first time last year after reconnecting over Facebook the couple lives separately in Clovis New Mexico and they developed feelings for each other and their relationship became sexual a few weeks later they've been banned from having any contact by the court here's what they look like do we have the the pictures of them at first I told okay video game Karlstad um um I'm sorry I know how you gonna react to this I'm your mom and you're my son and I am falling in love with him he said are you really I said yes I am he's saying you know what I was scared to let you know too I am too he was too falling in love with me with his mom and I was fall in love with my son and then wind up talking and we took off to the park and we end up asked him will you ever date your mom and he said well you date your son and I said honest truth yes I would because 19 years you're the best thing that ever happened to me and I really wanted to be with the rest of my life and I really wanted to be with them is kind of hard right now but I don't care what people say um what happened was we were we were hanging out and you know just talking you know I was just laughing and I looked at her and she looked at me and I just I kissed her here's a real kiss it was add feelings behind it I I had a spark in that ever since then it just you know it just stayed honestly I really didn't think we would we were both consenting adults if if it comes down to it you know it's just like the gays there you know as long as they're already teen everything's fine but you know she's an adult I'm a door I can make my own decisions I never thought it would blow up into something like this first of all they're both gorgeous specimens the the which is only relevant insofar as it's slightly hilarious like she's got a big face tattooed on the side of her face he's got tattoos down the side of his cheek it's just it's glorious all the way through here's the thing that is funny and ironic about all of this and look at that beautiful couple and that's just the offspring will be tremendous okay so the the reason that presumably the the reason that that it is illegal to participate in incest is because of the possibility of baring two-headed babies this is the usual reason that people give for why you should not have incest okay so the answer would be okay fine she gets her tubes tied right what he says when he says it's just like the gays this is actually not incorrect not that they are morally similar but if your only standard of a decent human sexual relationship is consent then the only standard is consent and you're just being a bigot right what business is it of yours whether a son has sex with his mother what business is it of yours if if he sees things from both directions no coming in and going out well what's what's the what is the what is the difference you know because that's just you being a bigot that's just you and your old-fashioned standards because the truth is the reason people oppose this is not because they hate theater two-headed babies it's because they look at this and they know deep down in their moral core that this is wrong and there is such a thing as the human conscience and people all over the world look at this and they say this is wrong this is nasty this is problematic right but does that just make you a bigot watch it will within five years it'll make you a bigot because if you say that these are two consenting adults they're in love how dare you put your standards on there love how dare you do that and I'd love to see the Supreme Court's explanation of why in fact the they shouldn't be to get married why shouldn't why should the government not confer dignity why shouldn't they confer dignity on these two people all the other only sin their only sin was to love each other and you have no good reasons I'm sorry you don't and by the way it would be particularly true if it happened to be a father and a son right because then there's no possibility of them actually having kids so it just demonstrates once you get rid of the idea that there's more to the morality of sax than just consent that there is something about the relationship between a man and a woman that's special for example within the context of marriage once you just say two consenting adults do whatever they want then incest the rules should be thrown out the window as well and then there's no really I mean that's the argument not just they should be thrown out they should be rewarded why shouldn't the government confer dignity on their relationship I would love to hear any answers on this I still haven't heard a good answer except that that people who are of the left get very offended when you ask the question this I know they don't like the question very much but that doesn't change the basic moral math here which is if you say only consent matters then only consent matters that's your only standard so my email address for all complaints and rageful enquiries is B Shapiro at Daily wire calm and and if you haven't answered that question if you're on the left or the right you think have a good answer I'd love to hear it because I'm open to any answers to that question because I'm having a hard time seeing as to why there's an answer to that question okay so tomorrow we will be back with much much more tomorrow I think we we do our weekly Bible study course for five minutes near the end but we will also on Thursday obviously have the the mailbag and we want you to be a part of that so you need to subscribe its daily wire.com to be a part of it and we're always so happy to have you join us here on the bench Shapiro show the number one conservative podcast in America see you tomorrow
