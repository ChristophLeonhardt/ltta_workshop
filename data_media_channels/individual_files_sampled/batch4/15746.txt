GQ magazine is stacked with plenty of smart editors so how'd they all end up suffering from a collective brain cramp by proclaiming Colin Kaepernick as their Citizen of the year not to worry GQ I'm gonna give you the name of a military hero not a football zero who should have received that honor so San Francisco's washed-up quarterback Colin Kaepernick is GQ citizen of the year I'll pause for a moment to let that sink in a former multi-millionaire NFL crybaby who openly disrespected the national anthem and everything it represents is somehow someway citizen of the year a guy who has proudly proclaimed that he's never voted is citizen of the Year an ingrate who wouldn't even grant GQ magazine an interview on being proclaimed citizen of the year is citizen of the year Wow say it ain't so Joe and you have to wonder has the definition of citizenship changed in recent months apparently so now I will give Kaepernick a pass on pleading the fifth by not consenting to an interview because really can even Kaepernick himself explained what he hoped to achieve with his anthem protest ostensibly this is about Kaepernick claiming that the number of young black men killed by police is epidemic really check out the stats from the Centers for Disease Control the CDC reported that in 1968 shootings by law enforcement was the cause of death for eight point six out of every million blacks by 2011 that eight point six number had declined to two point seven for hardly an epidemic quite the opposite actually so what pray tell was GQ thinking by choosing Kaepernick other than trying to generate controversy along with the reams of publicity that come with it GQ could have chosen a verified hero as its Citizen of the Year a maker rather than a taker such as oh I don't know someone who has been decorated with the Medal of Honor someone who's been described as the bravest of the brave that someone I'm thinking of is Clinton Romo che who just last weekend delivered a stirring speech at Virginia Tech in a world seemingly obsessed with Kaepernick's and Kardashians it's somewhat tragic Clinton Romo che isn't a hold name two because it really should be Romo Shay's act of heroism on the battlefield dates back to 2009 stationed at an outpost in Afghanistan Romo Shay's unit came under fire by an enemy force estimated at 400 Taliban fighters vastly outnumbered the 52 American soldiers at the outpost the enemy fighters occupied the high ground on all four sides and carried out an attack lasting 12 straight hours using rifles rocket-propelled grenades heavy machine guns and mortars Staff Sergeant Roma che answered the call of duty during this engagement that took the lives of eight American soldiers Romo che was able to kill multiple enemy fighters recover fallen soldiers and lead multiple resupply and counter-attacked operations at one point Romo che was wounded in the neck shoulder and arms by shrapnel despite these injuries Romo shade directed air support that would kill an estimated 30 Taliban fighters he then took out several more Taliban positions himself incredibly while still under fire he recovered several American casualties preventing their bodies from being dragged off by the enemy thanks to his off-the-chart bravery Romo che allowed his troop to regroup and successfully fight off a force that was far superior in numbers here's an excerpt of Romish a speech when he was inducted into the Hall of Heroes back in it makes for a mixture of humor humility and pathos on October 3rd 2009 nearly 400 Taliban fighters surrounded a place me and 52 other members Bravo troop 361 CAV called home 400 Taliban vs. 52 American soldiers just doesn't seem fair to the Taliban it was our home and they simply couldn't have it but as you know the Medal of Honor is not often given when things went well on a battlefield it tends to come at a price and heroes are often revealed some say I'm a hero but it doesn't make sense because I got to come home with few scars eight of my friends did not have that fortunate eight of my brothers fought to survive for place we had called home and more importantly they fought for their comrades and in the end they gave their lives and that defense those of may 8th amendment would you proclaim as citizen of the year an egomaniacal social justice warrior protesting a cause that's bogus to begin with or a real warrior who put his life on the line defending his country and all it stands for yeah I know what the hell was GQ thinking for the rebel dog media I'm David the men's Loyd Menzies hey folks the rebel has an all new fall lineup please visit the rebel dot media slash shows and check it out you
