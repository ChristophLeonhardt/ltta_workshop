SOME OF FORD'S ALLIES, POSSIBLY
DEMOCRATS.
JOINING US IS HARVARD LAW
PROFESSOR EMERITUS, AUTHOR OF
THE CASE AGAINST IMPEACHING
TRUMP, ALAN DERSHOWITZ.
>> THE PHONIEST ARGUMENT THEY
DIDN'T INTERVIEW HER.
SHE UNDER OATH TESTIFIED.
FBI BACKGROUND CHECKS DON'T
REPEAT WHAT HAPPENED PREVIOUSLY.
THE TWO PEOPLE THEY DIDN'T
INTERVIEW THE PEOPLE WHO
TESTIFIED.
THEIR JOB WAS TO FIND
CORROBORATION OR LACK OF
CORROBORATION.
IF SHE HAS ADDITIONAL WITNESSES
SHE SHOULD HAVE THEM PUTTING OUT
STATEMENTS, SWORN STATEMENTS
UNDER OATH.
THEN WE CAN EVALUATE THOSE.
BUT, RIGHT NOW, I THINK THE
ARGUMENT THAT SHE WASN'T
INTERVIEWED IS ABSURD ONE.
WHAT WOULD SHE DO, CHANGE HER
TESTIMONY?
SHE CANNOT HELP HERSELF.
SHE CAN ONLY HURT HERSELF TO BY
CHANGING TESTIMONY.
BRIAN: ERNEST ATTEMPT TO DELAY.
>> ERNEST ATTEMPT TO DELAY.
BRIAN: TWO SCENARIOS, ONE HE
PASSES, WHAT HAPPENS, AND ONE HE
DOESN'T, WHAT HAPPENS?
>> I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IMPACT IT
WILL HAVE ON THE ELECTION.
BRIAN: CHANGES THE COURT.
>> IT CHANGES THE COURT, BUT
CHANGES THE COURT LESS THAN IF
HE DOESN'T GET CONFIRMED AND
PRESIDENT TRUMP APPOINTS
SOMEBODY EVEN FURTHER TO THE
RIGHT.
THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.
THE COURT WILL BE CHANGED.
THAT'S THE REALITY OF A
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
THE QUESTION IS NOW, ALL ABOUT,
WHETHER WE ALLOW A NOMINEE TO BE
DISCREDITED WITHOUT HARD PROOF,
HARD EVIDENCE, AND WHETHER OR
NOT THIS ESTABLISHES AS
PRECEDENT TO THE FUTURE WHERE
NOBODY IS GOING TO WANT TO SERVE
ON THE BENCH.
THE IDEA THAT HE CAN'T TEACH AT
HARVARD NOW BECAUSE HE WAS
SUSPECTED?
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN
BROOKLYN COLLEGE AT STUDENT,
THEY FIRED PROFESSORS BECAUSE
THEY WERE SUSPECTED MAYBE BEING
COMMUNISTS WHEN THEY WERE IN
THEIR 20s.
SUSPICION WAS ENOUGH.
THIS KIND OF SEXUAL McCARTHY
SYSTEM A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE
PRECEDENT.
LOOK, WOMEN BEING ASSAULTED A
HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE THING BUT
WOMEN MAKING UP STORIES OF THE
WAY AT LEAST ONE WITNESS MAY
WELL HAVE MADE UP A STORY OUT OF
WHOLE CLOTH, THAT IS A SERIOUS
MATTER TOO.
WE HAVE TO LOOK INTO ALL OF
THESE ISSUES.
THIS IS A TEACHING MOMENT AND I
HOPE WE LEARN THE RIGHT THING
FROM THIS TEACHING MOMENT.
LOOK I'M NOT ADVOCATE FOR THIS
NOMINATION.
I WOULD NOT HAVE NOMINATED
KAVANAUGH.
MY CANDIDATE WOULD HAVE BEEN
MERRICK GARLAND THIS IS FOR ME
NOT ABOUT WHETHER THE MY CHOICE
GETS ON THE SUPREME COURT.
IT IS ABOUT WHETHER THE PROCESS
OF CONFIRMATION IS FOREVER
