1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,570
THERE ARE SO MANY STORMS BREWING
IN THE CARIBBEAN, I THINK

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,890
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TALK
ABOUT SOME OF THE DEVASTATION.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,140
HURRICANE MARIA WHICH REACHED
HURRICANE STATUS WENT BACK TO

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:17,750
FOUR, IT IS PICKING UP TO FIVE
AGAIN.

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,170
IT IS WREAKING HAVOC ON THE
ISLAND OF DOMINICA, ABOUT

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,529
78 OR 80,000 PEOPLE.

7
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:33,180
THESE ISLANDS, LIKE ISLANDS THAT
SUFFERED THE SAME FATE,

8
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:40,270
ESPECIALLY BARBUDA, IT IS
HAPPENING AGAIN NOW.

9
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:44,930
THE PRIME MINISTER OF DOMINICA
SAID AFTER BEING RESCUED FROM

10
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:53,340
HIS HOME ñ THAT IS EVERYTHING.

11
00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:05,570
IT 
IS AN INCREDIBLE THING

12
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,750
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW IF HIS

13
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,000
PREMONITIONS CAME THROUGH
BECAUSE ALL COMMUNICATION TO THE

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,960
ISLAND WAS CUT OFF.

15
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,320
THEY HAD NO WAY OF COMMUNICATING
WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

16
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,440
HERE IN FLORIDA YOU CAN DRIVE TO
GEORGIA, INLAND OR DO OTHER

17
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,440
THINGS.

18
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,980
WHEN YOU'RE ON A SMALL ISLAND
THERE IS NO PLACE YOU CAN GO.

19
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,390
IT'S EASY, WE TALK ABOUT
CLIMATE CHANGE SO MUCH ñ

20
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:40,990
IT IS EASY TO BLAME IT.

21
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,200
I WANTED
TO FIND OUT IF THIS WAS RELATED

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,630
TO CLIMATE CHANGE.

23
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:58,210
YES, OBVIOUSLY IT'S RELATING TO
CLIMATE CHANGE.

24
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,000
CHANGES IN HER PLANET'S
ATMOSPHERE DID NOT CAUSE

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,380
HURRICANES.

26
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:25,060
EVERYTHING THAT 
A HURRICANE

27
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:30,350
BRINGS, NO ONE IS SAYING

28
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,860
THAT CLIMATE CHANGE CAUSES
HURRICANES.

29
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:42,970
FOR THE CLIMATE CHANGED, IT WAS
NOT ñ WE WOULD HAVE HURRICANES.

30
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,600
YEAH, WE ALWAYS HAD
HURRICANES.

31
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,180
ANYONE WHO USES THAT ARGUMENT IS
MISSING THE POINT.

32
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,170
IT'S NOT ABOUT ALL THIS AND WE
HAVE HURRICANES.

33
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:59,050
IT'S ABOUT THE SEVERITY OF THE
STORMS, THE AMOUNT OF RAINFALL,

34
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,010
THE RISING SEA LEVELS.

35
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:05,890
AND ALSO THE MOISTURE AND THE
HEAT THAT EXACERBATES THE

36
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,180
SITUATION.

37
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,240
BACK IN THE DAY YOU WOULD HEAR
ABOUT STORMS LIKE THIS AND

38
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,020
THEY WOULD REFER TO IT AS A ONCE
EVERY 500 YEAR STORMS.

39
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:20,170
NOW WE HAVE MAJOR STORMS THAT
CAUSED SEVERE DAMAGE TO OUR

40
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,540
COUNTRY AS WELL AS OTHERS EVERY
YEAR.

41
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,160
IT'S GOING TO GET WORSE.

42
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,270
AND WE WILL CONTINUE IGNORING
IT.

43
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,770
WE PULLED OUT OF THE CLIMATE
AGREEMENT, THE PARIS

44
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:37,800
CLIMATE AGREEMENT.

45
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,130
WE ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING TO
COVER OUR BASES IN THE EVENT

46
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,340
THAT ALL THE SCIENTISTS ARE
RIGHT.

47
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,080
EVERY ACTION IT SEEMS WE ARE
TAKING IS LEADING US FURTHER

48
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,540
AWAY FROM ADMONITIONS INSTEAD OF
CLOSER IN LINE WITH THEIR

49
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,540
RECOMMENDATIONS.

50
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:57,450
AND WE ARE THE ONLY COUNTRY IN
THE WORLD THAT DEBATES THIS.

51
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,400
ONLY IN AMERICA DO WE DEBATE
WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS

52
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
HAPPENING.

53
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
WHY?

54
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,670
TO PROTECT THE FOSSIL FUEL
COMPANIES.

55
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:09,030
TO PROTECT THE FACT THAT WE
ARE PART OF DESTROYING THE

56
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,030
ENVIRONMENT.

57
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,580
WE ARE REALLY POWERFUL TO HELP
FIX IT.

58
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,680
THE STARTING POINT IS
ACKNOWLEDGING, AND GETTING BACK

59
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,099
INTO THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD.

60
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:25,150
ON THE DAY THAT TRUMP ADDRESSED
THE UNITED NATIONS THIS WAS

61
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,550
NOT A BIG TOPIC THERE.

62
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:33,499
THE CENTRAL CHALLENGE IN
GETTING PEOPLE TO AFFECT POLICY

63
00:04:33,499 --> 00:04:36,950
THAT ADDRESSES CLIMATE CHANGE
ISSUES IS THAT IT IS A NOT

64
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,950
PRESSING THREAT.

65
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:46,060
AT THE KIND OF THING WHERE WHEN
YOU HAVE A SCIENTIST SAY HERE

66
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,370
ARE MODELS WE PLAYED OVER DOZENS
OF YEARS, BUT IS FURTHER

67
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,520
DOWN THE LINE.

68
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,710
ANYTHING THE PEOPLE WANT TO GET
DONE INVOLVES SOME KIND OF

69
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,919
PRESSING ISSUE.

70
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:00,370
SUCH AS THIS YEAR WE CAN MAKE
THIS MUCH MONEY IF WE OPEN UP

71
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,150
THIS FIELD TO BE DRILLED OR
FRACKED.

72
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,410
THAT IS A PRESSING ISSUE THAT
GETS FOLKS MORE EXCITED.

73
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:14,120
NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THINGS THAT
ARE MORE INTENSE BECAUSE OF

74
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,569
HIGHER SEE TEMPERATURES.

75
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:18,220
THAT IS THE ONE THING THEY TEACH
YOU IN WEATHER AND STORMS

76
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,610
ABOUT HURRICANES.

77
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,849
THEY FEED OFF WARMER WATERS.

78
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:26,539
LOOK NO FURTHER THAN WHERE THE
HURRICANE GOES FROM CATEGORY 3

79
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:28,089
TO 4.

80
00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:32,439
IT DOES THAT OVER THE WARM
WATERS OF THE GULF, AND IT LOSES

81
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:35,960
POWER OVER THE LAND OR OVER
COLDER WATER.

82
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,159
THAT IS JUST HOW IT WORKS.

83
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:39,619
IF YOU'RE RAISING THE
TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER,

84
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:45,379
BARRING ANY DRASTIC TEMPERATURE,
YOU WILL HAVE A HUGE ASS

85
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:46,379
HURRICANE.

86
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:50,249
EVERYONE IS TRYING TO SHAKE
THESE FOLKS AND SAY THIS IS THE

87
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:54,349
DEPRESSING THING THIS IS WHAT IT
LOOKS LIKE AND FEELS LIKE.

88
00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:59,339
THE SEA LEVELS HAVE ALWAYS
RISEN, BUT AGAIN PEOPLE ARE

89
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:02,240
SAYING THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO
TALK ABOUT IT.

90
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,580
IT'S SO FRUSTRATING.

91
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:08,069
IT'S LIKE THE UNITED STATES IS
THE CERSEI LANNISTER OF GAME

92
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:09,089
OF THRONES.

93
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:12,629
AND THE WHITE WALKERS ARE
COMING, BUT WE ARE IN DENIAL.

94
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:15,409
IT IS SO FRUSTRATING.

95
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:20,310
THIS IS WHERE I PRETEND I KNOW
WHAT SHE IS TALKING ABOUT.

96
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:26,110
IT'S LIKE THE WHITE WALKERS
ARE CLIMATE CHANGE.

97
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:30,189
I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT
IT NOT BEING A PRESSING MATTER

98
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:34,680
FOR MOST AMERICANS WHICH IS WHY
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE ARE

99
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,089
ABLE TO BRUSH IT UNDER THE RUG.

100
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:43,199
HERE IS ANOTHER THING, THERE IS
ANOTHER PRESSING MATTER THAT I

101
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,899
THINK TAKES PRIORITY OVER DOING
SOMETHING ABOUT CLIMATE

102
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:49,080
CHANGE, THE ISSUE OF JOBS.

103
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:54,349
I REMEMBER HAVING A CONVERSATION
WITH A YOUNG GUY ON A PLANE, A

104
00:06:54,349 --> 00:06:59,050
LIBERAL GUY WHO IS AN ENGINEER
ON AN OIL RIG.

105
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,159
POLITICALLY SPEAKING HIS
LIBERAL.

106
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:05,580
WHEN IT CAME TO THE ISSUE OF
CLIMATE CHANGE, IT WAS

107
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,369
INTERESTING BECAUSE HE
ACKNOWLEDGED IT, BUT HE DOESN'T

108
00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:11,499
WANT TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT
BECAUSE THAT MEANS HE HAS TO GO

109
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:15,610
FIND ANOTHER JOB, AND HE IS IN A
CUSHY POSITION WORKING FOR

110
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,360
EXXON.

111
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,350
WHEN IT COMES TO FEEDING YOUR
FAMILY, BUT IS ALWAYS GOING

112
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,490
TO TAKE PRIORITY OVER DOING
SOMETHING THAT WILL BENEFIT

113
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,490
THE PLANET.

114
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,419
BUT HERE IS THE THING, IF YOU'RE
WORRIED ABOUT NATIONAL SECURITY

115
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:33,869
OR THE COST OF FOOD, OR THE
REFUGEE CRISIS THAT WE ARE

116
00:07:33,869 --> 00:07:38,020
DEALING WITH IN THE MIDDLE EAST,
ALL OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BECOME

117
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,639
EXACERBATED MOVING FORWARD.

118
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,580
AND WE SEE IT GET WORSE EVERY
YEAR.

119
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,819
ONE OF THE KNOTS AGAINST
CLIMATE CHANGE AS AN ISSUE

120
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:47,599
HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT IT IS A
TOMORROW ISSUE.

121
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,280
TOMORROW ISSUES DON'T PLAY
POLITICALLY.

122
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,520
PEOPLE VOTE THEIR POCKETBOOKS
AND THINK ABOUT WHERE THEIR

123
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,869
NEXT MEAL OR JOB IS COMING FROM.

124
00:07:57,869 --> 00:08:00,800
EXCEPT NOW IT IS A TODAY ISSUE.

125
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,599
THAT IS WHY RUNNING INTO THIS
WALL OF ATTITUDES THAT COME FROM

126
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,899
THE OTHER PARTY ON THIS, THE
PARTY THAT IS STANDING AWAY OF

127
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:12,419
THESE THINGS, AND DONALD TRUMP
AND HAS A MINISTRATION OR

128
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:17,569
STANDING IN THE WAY OF THIS,
IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT

129
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:21,080
IS A TODAY ISSUE AND IT IS NOT
THE SAME TYPE OF THING AS

130
00:08:21,080 --> 00:00:00,000
IT USED TO BE.
