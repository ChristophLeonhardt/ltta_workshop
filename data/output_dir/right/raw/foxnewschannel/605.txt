1
00:00:03,141 --> 00:00:06,243
LITTLE MORE CASUAL.

2
00:00:09,548 --> 00:00:10,314
I COME UP FROM WASHINGTON AND

3
00:00:10,315 --> 00:00:14,251
GOT TO ASK YOU ABOUT A STORY, A

4
00:00:14,252 --> 00:00:21,392
FEDERAL JUDGE IN DC WANTED TO

5
00:00:21,393 --> 00:00:22,259
RESTART THE DACA PROGRAM.

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,996
PRESIDENT OBAMA PUT IN PLACE

7
00:00:25,997 --> 00:00:26,730
THE DACA TO SHIELD CHILDREN

8
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:27,498
BROUGHT BY THEIR PARENTS FROM

9
00:00:27,499 --> 00:00:28,999
BEING DEPORTED.

10
00:00:30,235 --> 00:00:34,238
THAT.

11
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:34,939
AND EXECUTIVE ORDER SAYS

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:40,144
CONGRESS, YOU FIGURE IT OUT.

13
00:00:40,145 --> 00:00:40,911
THIS JUDGE SAYS THEY NEED TO

14
00:00:40,912 --> 00:00:42,246
RESTART IT.

15
00:00:42,247 --> 00:00:42,913
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?

16
00:00:42,914 --> 00:00:46,617
>> MY FIRST THOUGHT IS I KNOW

17
00:00:46,618 --> 00:00:47,418
MY POINT OF VIEW ON IMMIGRATION

18
00:00:47,419 --> 00:00:48,185
IS DIFFERENT FROM MOST OF OUR

19
00:00:48,186 --> 00:00:50,254
VIEWERS AND I EXPECT THE THREE

20
00:00:50,255 --> 00:00:55,326
OF YOU AS WELL.

21
00:00:55,327 --> 00:00:58,262
I AM FOR DACA.

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:02,833
COMPASSIONATE AND PRAGMATIC.

23
00:01:02,834 --> 00:01:03,634
WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA DID, THESE

24
00:01:03,635 --> 00:01:04,368
KIDS WERE BROUGHT HERE AT A

25
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:05,136
YOUNG AGE THROUGH NO FAULT OF

26
00:01:05,137 --> 00:01:06,570
THEIR OWN, THE RIGHT THING TO

27
00:01:09,808 --> 00:01:11,442
AND HE WANTS TO END THE

28
00:01:11,443 --> 00:01:12,576
PROGRAM.

29
00:01:12,577 --> 00:01:16,313
WHAT THE JUDGE DID IN THIS CASE

30
00:01:16,314 --> 00:01:18,249
WAS NOT TO SAY THE TRUMP

31
00:01:28,593 --> 00:01:29,393
FOR RESCINDING THE PROGRAM AND

32
00:01:29,394 --> 00:01:30,161
THE REASON THEY PUT FORTH THE

33
00:01:30,162 --> 00:01:34,231
HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY AND

34
00:01:34,232 --> 00:01:36,667
OTHERS WERE POLITICAL RHETORIC,

35
00:01:36,668 --> 00:01:38,269
THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE TRUMP

36
00:01:46,278 --> 00:01:54,251
AWAY A RIGHT AND PRIVILEGE.

37
00:01:55,787 --> 00:01:58,255
--

38
00:01:58,256 --> 00:02:02,259
>> YOU EXPECT IT WAS.

39
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,993
>> ONLY IF THE RATIONALE IS

40
00:02:02,994 --> 00:02:06,197
LEGAL.

41
00:02:06,198 --> 00:02:10,234
NOT JUST SELECTIVE ENFORCEMENT.

42
00:02:22,247 --> 00:02:22,980
THE ARGUMENT WAS GIVEN, AND

43
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:23,781
EXECUTIVE ORDER CREATED THIS,

44
00:02:23,782 --> 00:02:24,548
WHY CAN'T AN EXECUTIVE ORDER

45
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:26,116
AND DO IT.

46
00:02:26,117 --> 00:02:26,884
YOU HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

47
00:02:26,885 --> 00:02:30,254
INVESTED IN THIS PROGRAM, THEIR

48
00:02:30,255 --> 00:02:32,957
LIVES ARE SETTLED, THEY HAVE

49
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:33,691
BEEN HERE 10 YEARS OR MORE.

50
00:02:33,692 --> 00:02:34,425
SOME ARE MARRIED, THEY HAVE

51
00:02:34,426 --> 00:02:38,262
CITIZEN CHILDREN.

52
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:42,533
THIS IS A BAD ARGUMENT FOR

53
00:02:42,534 --> 00:02:53,244
DONALD FROM.

54
00:02:53,245 --> 00:02:53,444
DONALD FROM.

55
00:02:53,445 --> 00:02:54,245
>> IF HE TELLS THESE DREAMERS,

56
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,286
IF YOU GIVE ME $25 BILLION TO

57
00:03:02,287 --> 00:03:02,987
BUILD THE WALL THAT IS A

58
00:03:02,988 --> 00:03:09,360
COMPROMISE THAT MAKE SENSE.

59
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:10,261
LET'S JUST MAKE IT A STRAIGHT

60
00:03:10,262 --> 00:03:13,564
COMPROMISE DEAL.

61
00:03:13,565 --> 00:03:17,368
>> A COMPROMISE DEAL IS A

62
00:03:17,369 --> 00:00:00,000
REMINDER CONGRESS IS A HUGE
