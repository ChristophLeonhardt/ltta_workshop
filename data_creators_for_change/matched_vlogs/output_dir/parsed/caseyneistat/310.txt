that's our boat that's our Beach
what are we doing today Candace
sorry the audio is messed up I broke my
microphone like two seconds ago this is
the romantic vacation honeymoon
what was that trip this is the recap and
this is over there we're having a family
picnic I think a good place to start
would be to explain the boat that we
were on there was a cruise and it was
the same thing that we were on for our
honeymoon we loved it
we're in the park have you left the pork
butt in the park having like a family
picnic and there's this couple over
there and like the guy's got his hands
up the girl's skirt and she keeps like
lifting her dress up and you can see her
and tire she's like wearing a thong it's
wildly inappropriate it's all kids and
families around here and then these two
and this has come here at the bar
do you love Backstreet Boys
our room in the boat was tiny but
totally fine perfectly adequate yeah
that was awesome they make you your own
pajamas here mine say mister nice tat
canvases say Candace why don't you think
they put your last name on yours
good my name is Candace pool they didn't
want to offend me by saying missus and I
said if I was like some feminist that
said now my name is can as well little
do they know it's just cuz I'm too lazy
and the people that are on this boat are
like mostly middle-aged no the weight
isn't right retired people isn't we were
on the younger side of the people on
this boat remember the dance party
wait oh then we had all this trouble in
the airport that ultimately ended with
us getting to Venice and having no
luggage whatsoever all of our suitcases
were missing we will be in two places
one will be intro gear TR Oh
gir what if this is they find our bags
Airport tomorrow and then they're gonna
drive them to the boat this will happen
tomorrow I think so that's good yeah
I'm just relieved they have that I'm
gonna that's like 50% of day 2 of the
holiday we're in I don't know how to say
somewhere in Croatia lovely here still
don't have our bags but rumor has it
we're gonna have them tomorrow which is
tremendously excited I was kind of
excited about buying more cheesy clothes
that we've just been buying the cheapest
as in least expensive clothing we could
find to keep ourselves dress look at
this mannequin wasn't something seemed
kinda strange with her
we just got some crucial information
they found one of our bags as in either
Candace's bag or my bag if it's
Candace's bag I'm going to be very upset
but happy for you
we're in Croatia in where's this town
called a party Oh Bhatia
this is Bronco they say that right yeah
a woman came up to Candace and said
Candace your leg egde and I think she
meant luggage oh my god there it is is
it Candace and thus concludes the
luggage saga
see later
thank you
the bull would stop somewhere like
everyday like a regular cruise and you
could go to the town that you stopped in
or you can stay on the boat if you
stayed on the boat
my favorite thing to do is you they let
you swim off of the back of the boat
which was awesome
and one time we rented a boat
remember our boat that was the SS 420 no
joke check it out 420 thank you
you know what you did drive it
I have footage of you driving it
just as hard as you can
except I can't show most that footage
because you have your top off and
there's a lot of ass you do not have an
old-lady big ass I'm showing your ass we
found this little beach that we made our
own that was a special time that was the
best spot
all right
in a cave kind of smells like sounds
like bats
franciene just took off
runs like she's been drinking Francine's
ready to go ready to go home
I never finished
we never ended our video it's like 11
o'clock right now Candice is eating
microwaved
Walter oh it looks gross all in all it
was like the greatest it was the first
trip we had been on since the baby was
born and it was great
anything else you want to add in this
video you haven't really contributed
much Candice see when you get old and
you have kids it's really hard to get
away because if that's when you watch
the kids it was amazing anyway she's up
I'm not gonna get her alright that
concludes the romantic getaway recap
extravaganza we terrible parents
and that's it it's 455 a.m. right now
