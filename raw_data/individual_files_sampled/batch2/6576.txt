far-right activists who will be coming to San Francisco to hold a rally this Saturday will have a smelly surprise when they meet from some peace activists they are going to be greeted with dog excrement dog feces dog shit so hundreds of San Franciscans plan to prepare Crissy Field the picturesque beach in the shadow of the Golden Gate Bridge where right-wing protest group patriot prayer will gather with a generous carpet of excrement the idea came from Tuffy tuffington who said that he had the epiphany while he was just walking his dogs that wouldn't it be funny if you had all these uh these right-wing activists just stomping around in some poop and he thought that it was a little bit of what he said civil disobedience and they didn't have to engage with these people face-to-face because obviously as we've seen all over the country they just can escalate and get and turn violent and didn't want to do that so tuffington a 45 year old artist and designer create a Facebook event page based on the concept and the dog owners in San Francisco responded in droves many have declared their intention to stockpile their shit piles for days in advance then deliver them in bags for the site the group is also planning to reconvene on Sunday to clean up the mess and hug each other that's not the only thing that will be meeting these activists they're gonna be met with flower power drag queens a contingent of clowns kayakers cars and kids it sounds it sounds like a party if you didn't know any better yeah so this is what Cleve Jones has said in LGBTQ rights activists he said about this you have a significant number of people who would like to go and punch Nazis and then you have people who think they should be entirely ignored in between you have all sorts of creative and crazy ideas I kind of like that so my question for you guys is is littering this filled with dog poop is that just a creative benevolent crazy idea just like the clowns and the kayakers or is this actually you know not peaceful like hey it really sucks when you step in dog poop this isn't peaceful I don't like this where do you stand guys Ambria not in the dog shed you know I don't stand remember sorry no writing it down writing that down don't just in terms of strategy if you're gonna be Shady be privately shady like I don't like that we know now that this is gonna happen so now they can kind of preempt this and maneuver around the shit as opposed to walking right into it meet them in advance I mean if I were going to this rally if I was going to this meeting and I would now see this it's in the Guardian that's right not secret I would meet the me like don't shit away from here like I would and then maybe it would turn violent maybe that I'm a dog fighting or something I don't know this is really bad this is a really fun idea you know when you have it's the person who Tuffy tuffington already has had fun ideas like to have the name Tuffy tuffington is walking their dog and the dog takes a poop and they're like we should do that to Nazis like that's fun and the idea when you get the word out about it that it'll and then it's in the Guardian and I read the title turd Reich that makes it really funny for me the thing is you you also will have a period of your life dedicated to like putting dog shit in a pile and that's where it's too far for me that's where I'm like I'm this is a clever creative idea but I'm also like picking up dog poop to save it yeah and that's when I feel crazy yeah and then going back to clean it up it's there's so much labor involved in this Prout in this protest this anti protest that that's I mean they're gonna go back clean it up I don't know I feel well what they could do if what means we can offer them some logistical advice what they could do is just bring now all their dog walks up until Saturday when the activists are gathering we'll be at the the Crissy Field jobs there so then they just they poop and they pee right there and then you come back on Sunday and you pick it all up but it's gonna be caked into the ground and I know just experience it's not fun to pick up dog poop that's cake yeah yeah it's left foot I just the execution of the idea I think is what's and what does it do about white supremacy like at the end of the day makes it sweater welcome and then what did what a drag queens or like the flower crowns that they're gonna be handing out what does any of it do really it's more it's more sort of symbolic and they're different ways of approaching that and I think that the the the sim the symbolism and what you can bring to these people that you just so vehemently absolutely disagree with is it just makes you feel better really it's not about where you're gonna you're not gonna be changing any hearts there sure this is brilliant idea and the more I think about it more I think they should do it it's way better than punching Nazis which I don't think you should do people of are the people who come online and go you can punch them cuz they're Nazis like no once you punch them then you kind of are a jerk to you they were they were Nazis and you were just someone who net doesn't punch anyone and now they're Nazis and you're someone who just punches people even if they're Nazis I like the idea of a lot of folks in San Francisco who if you've ever been to like a public event in San Francisco it's super awesome and super fun and yeah randomly people can be naked it's fantastic those people being out there and around and having a better time than the angry Nazis right that's what I like about San Francisco festivals is everyone's just having the best time ever or if you try to be me and you just feel ridiculous I think that that's sort of what the spirit of this is yeah that's why I think the dogshit thing is a little strange because they were saying they want to use their their particular strengths so they have humor seaworthiness the ability to monopolize parking spaces and cuteness respectively the Sun their noses that hate and with what sort of is an outlier to that is that then these people are just tramping around and Boop and they're in a bad mood and I think that it's better to you know the Selena Gomez fan of me is just like kill them with kindness just be as kind as as you can and I don't think that's stepping in the dog learning some things about you take help us build independent media together TYT Network comm slash jewelry
