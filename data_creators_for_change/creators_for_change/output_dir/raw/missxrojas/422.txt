normally<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have six hours of pluses a</font>

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,300
week that's because my course is mainly

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">research based in a way also because i</font>

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,629
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> write dissertation this year</font>

5
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:08,189
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> morning there's an extra hour at</font>

6
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,200
nine a.m. on a monday and i really like

7
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,490
morning lectures because it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

8
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,440
get them out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can kind of</font>

9
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,639
think about them for rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day</font>

10
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,260
rather than kind of pooling around until

11
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,270
your 4pm lecture whatever anyway my

12
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,070
lecture this morning was one about being

13
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,810
employable getting a career and a job

14
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,130
and a life and all that and what makes

15
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">things worse other than a job sector at</font>

16
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,699
you know my<font color="#CCCCCC"> name the morning of monday</font>

17
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,590
was that she opened it by saying most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

18
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,420
you and at the end seconds going it

19
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,820
faster the pipe things<font color="#CCCCCC"> were very aware</font>

20
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,680
of a timetable you know you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

21
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">really set things in motion now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you is</font>

22
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,250
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the last stages</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font>

23
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,629
none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will have really left it</font>

24
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,309
this late to start thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what</font>

25
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,110
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably want to do after she</font>

26
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,579
said that there were about five seconds

27
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,039
of tangible silence in the room after

28
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,510
which everyone started whispering worthy

29
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,070
to one another wait what have you you

30
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,899
know what you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do like what but I</font>

31
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,730
think I sort of know what I want to do

32
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:54,989
yeah sure there were people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that room</font>

33
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:56,520
who had a really solid knowledge about

34
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,960
what they wanted to do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that future</font>

35
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">and precisely and had like a career path</font>

36
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,289
and like we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to convert to lure</font>

37
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:02,850
or something like that most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

38
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:03,960
sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in her chair thinking actually</font>

39
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,820
you know I do know that i really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

40
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,780

41
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing and trying to be working tools but</font>

42
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,330
some days I wake up and I can't think

43
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,590
about a thing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things mush right</font>

44
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,670
now because I can't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> in full</font>

45
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,020
sentences i think sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> or maybe</font>

46
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,220
this is another thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i should be</font>

47
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,180
doing maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> i should be doing other</font>

52
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,409

53
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:25,049
