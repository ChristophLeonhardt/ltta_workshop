costumes and Colorado will now be arming their teachers with guns in an effort to cut down on gun violence now teachers will be offered a three day course which consists of firearms and medical training and it was launched on Tuesday in Weld County now 17 members of staff who would like to be considered armed first responders have so far taken part and the pilot program will allow volunteers to enter schools with guns under us concealed carry laws now this course is provided by the faculty administration administrator safety training and emergency response group otherwise known as faster and it was set up by parents law enforcement officers and medical experts who believe that US schools are a soft target for violence now this was set up after Sandy Hook and 2012 now the move has angered a certain campaign groups such as safe campus Colorado which encourages its supporters to petition local authorities to help keep guns out of school which i think is something that we can all agree on in fact when you look at some of the numbers and you look at the shootings that have happened unfortunately in schools of the 37 school shootings in 26 states they found that nearly 2/3 of those incidents the attacker got the gun from his or her own family or that of a relative so while I think they have good intention here by arming some of the teachers I think it would be much more prudent to talk to parents and talk to relatives of students about their gun safety within their own homes since that's where these school shooters have received their handguns and whatnot there's the thing is like at school you're gonna the plan to do this they have one here they have one in Pennsylvania where they just I think it's Pennsylvania where they bought like four semi-automatic rifles they're gonna have them at school and parents are upset the idea is you're going to have guns at school now theoretically those are all going to be in the possession of trained teachers who have the guns under lock and key in their own supervision at all times that's it kids get into places they're not supposed to get into and if you have the agenda and you know that the gun is there and you don't have to break into your family's locker you could just find out where the gun is at school and maybe get that that's what I don't like about it I'm sure we can investigate more security at schools I don't know where we'll get the funding but like I'm fine with more security at schools so long as they're you know because I like you know the police being there or the security being there to protect it with the kids but this just sounds like such a bad idea yeah I mean obviously what you alluded to there is having the risk of gun theft within the school by students and kids or whatever but the other component of it that kind of scares me the most is that this program is a three day program okay and so you you know I don't think you can it's like stop an active shooter after a three day program like I took a CPR class when I was in high school and after that I would definitely not be able to administer CPR I can't imagine trying to have an active shooter who's trying to shoot at kids so this just all this just screams bad idea to me and it just is good I think it's gonna prove unfortunately very very dangerous to these kids were in these schools with added guns when we're trying to prevent gun violence I think I'm taking three CPR course in my life yeah if you had a heart attack and I was doing UC Pierre you would have heart attack and three broken ribs okay so before I trash this idea I would like to give them credit for an excellent acronym faster faster because they want a faster response and they through safety training and emergency response and faculty there that's good work dents it's it's a grime borderline great acronym yeah there's there's no superfluous words just to cover the letter those are really good yes nice job on that and Hanna you left out one part of them they're saying this is a soft target for violence the group also refers to schools as victim zones you're in the victim zone okay guys just please okay calm down for a second now look school bias is terrible we all want to prevent it but bringing in the weapons to the school is not going to help you prevent it and one of the it's gonna happen is you're gonna have all these guys who can't wait to use their weapons cuz there isn't anyone who is gonna get training in the weaponry to protect kids who isn't going to have a daydream about how they're a hero and they protect the kids by using their weapon then you've every person who went through that program can't wait to unleash the weapon terrible idea so if my kids are going at school no no no don't have all these guys daydreaming about being a hero with weapons inside the school you're more likely to die from a weapon if it's in the building it's just a fact so there's a study after study if your house has a gun you're much much much more likely to die from gun violence because the guns already there and the majority I think it's like 1% with the majority of gun violence that involve children and different homicide rates and suicide rates and things like that happen outside of schools like these school shootings are horrendous and horrific but the majority of shootings happen like when kids get these guns from home and so that's the real thing that we need to target not arming teachers with more guns like you said we're gonna have this sort of like cop with a badge complex who want to like exert their power authority and heroics has weird self-fulfilling prophecy yep and so I'll start the countdown now is there's no way there isn't going one of these guys isn't going to cause a shooting at a school okay well let's just I don't know okay but it's gonna happen because that's how it works if you have weapons somewhere someone eventually uses the weapons so I don't know if it's a I don't know the circumstances for ion or through which it's gonna happen but if you put those weapons there they will get used so the countdown begins and unfortunately it will it's it's studies bear out that it is an near inevitability and hopefully with more of these articles about like bringing the statistics and bringing the studies into the conversation this will sort of dissuade schools from entering the faster program and hopefully dissuade teachers from wanting to like be trained in sort of this active shooter situation instead of be trained and like talking about gun safety with your kids or you know other sort of mechanisms to to ensure the safety of their students young turks now has over 6 billion lifetime views you know who did that you did that we're now larger than CNN ABC you name
