>>A LAWSUIT AGAINST FLORIDA
GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT SOUGHT TO
OVERTURN AN EFFECTIVE BAN ON
RESTORING THE VOTING RIGHTS
OF FORMER FELONS, AND NOW WE
HAVE A VERDICT ON 
IT --
>>THEY HAD ALREADY PAID THEIR
DEBT TO SOCIETY AND THEY WANTED
TO START PARTICIPATING IN
SOCIETY ONCE AGAIN, WHICH IN
MANY STATES IS SOMETHING YOU CAN
DO, BUT IT'S HARDER IN SOME AND
DAMN NEAR IMPOSSIBLE AND OTHERS,
LIKE FLORIDA, BUT PERHAPS
NOT IN THE FUTURE --
>>MARK WALKER, IMPRESSIVE
WRITTEN OPINION.
>>THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S
DONE AND FIXED TODAY BUT MARK
WALKER WILL BE HOLDING HEARINGS
IN FEBRUARY AND THAT IS A
GOOD FIRST STEP.
>>THAT OUTLINES HOW RIDICULOUS
THE PROCESS IS.
ESSENTIALLY YOU
DRAG YOUR CASE BEFORE THIS
COMMITTEE AND ULTIMATELY AFTER
YOU'VE MADE YOUR CASE, AND EVEN
THIS COMMITTEE, WHICH IS LIKELY
STACKED AGAINST YOU, SAYS OKAY,
VOTING RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD GET
THEM BACK, EXCEPT THE GOVERNOR
CAN OVERTURN THAT.
THAT IS
ESSENTIALLY THE WAY IT IS SET UP
IN FLORIDA.
>>AND HOW ARE YOU VOTING, BY THE
WAY?
>>THERE WAS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT.
>>ALSO THERE IS A 10,000 PERSON
BACK LOG OF APPLICANTS TO TRY TO
GET THEIR VOTING RIGHTS
RESTORED.
AND FELONIES BY THE
WAY ARE ALSO NONVIOLENT DRUG
OFFENSES AND ROBBERY.
SO AGAIN,
THESE AREN'T RAPISTS AND
MURDERERS IN EVERY CASE.
>>OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE WOULD
BE A FELONY.
WHICH JUST COMES TO
MIND.
>>FOR WHATEVER REASON.
AND THIS
IS ONE OF THE TOPICS, I'VE SEEN
TUCKER CARLSON TALK ABOUT THIS,
THEY WANT FELONS TO VOTE.
AND
THEY UNDERSTAND THAT NO MATTER
WHAT THE TOPIC OR THE
INTELLECTUAL MERIT, YOU ARE
SUPPOSED TO FEEL WEIRD AND BAD
ABOUT SAYING ANYTHING POSITIVE
ABOUT SOMEONE WHO HAS BROKEN THE
LAW.
THEY ARE JUST TERRIBLE,
DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY WENT TO
JAIL ALREADY -- BUT
PHILOSOPHICALLY WHY SHOULDN'T
THEY BE ABLE TO VOTE?
YOU TALKED
ABOUT THE NONVIOLENT CRIMES,
OKAY, WHAT IF THEY BEAT THE SHIT
OUT OF SOMEONE AND THEY GO TO
JAIL FOR 10 YEARS AND THEY ARE
OUT.
WHY ARE THEY BANNED FROM
PARTICIPATING IN DEMOCRACY?
THAT
SEEMS LIKE THE SORT OF THING
THAT WOULD HELP REINTEGRATE
SOMEONE INTO SOCIETY.
YOU ARE
EXPECTED TO AGREE WITH IT BY THE
RIGHT WING THAT FELONS ARE THE
WORST PEOPLE AND THEY SHOULDN'T
BE ALLOWED TO VOTE, AND
THERE IS NO LOGICAL UNDERPINNING
FOR THAT.
>>IT'S ALSO HOW THEY PAINT
IMMIGRANTS, IN THE WORST WAY.
BUT IF THE STATE DEEMS YOU
WORTHY OF BEING RELEASED YOU
SHOULD BE WORTHY OF THE VOTE.
IF
YOU PAID YOUR DEBT TO THE POINT
THAT YOU WERE RELEASED FROM
INCARCERATION YOU SHOULD BE
ALLOWED TO VOTE, PARTICULARLY
SINCE THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT VOTE THAT
ARE INVOLVED IN THE PRISON
SYSTEM.
THE PRIVATIZATION OF
PRISONS, CORRUPTION IN THE
PRISON SYSTEM, THESE ARE THINGS
THAT ARE HANDLED BY VOTING.
HERE
IS SOMEONE WHO JUST CAME OUT OF
THE PRISON SYSTEM, THEY
SHOULD HAVE A WINDOW ON THIS.
>>THIS COULD SET A PRECEDENT FOR
OTHER STATES, I THINK IT'S FOR
THE POSITIVE AND I KNOW THERE
ARE PEOPLE WORKING ON THIS
CAMPAIGN, THAT'S SUPER
IMPORTANT.
BECAUSE IT'S REALLY
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF
INSTITUTIONALIZED RACISM AND
CLASSISM IN WAYS THAT -- IT'S
FUNNY, I LIVED IN LATIN AMERICA
FOR A WHILE AND VOTING IS
MANDATORY, YOU HAVE TO VOTE.
SO
WHAT HAPPENS?
YOU BUY OFF THE
POOR PEOPLE.
BUT WHEN VOTING
ISN'T MANDATORY YOU JUST TRY TO
TAKE THEIR VOTING RIGHTS AWAY,
PEOPLE WHO ARE MINORITIES OR
OPPRESSED OR WHATEVER.
THIS WOULD BE A HUGE STEP IN
CHANGING THAT.
