STEVE: ONE THING THAT EVEN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BIGGEST CRITICS CAN'T SAY IS THAT HASN'T KEPT HIS PROMISES THOUGH HE HAS FALLEN SHORT ON A FEW OF THE CAMPAIGN PLEDGES, THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN TRUE TO HIS WORD. A NEW OP-ED FROM "THE WASHINGTON POST ARGUES THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NOT ONLY KEPT HIS PROMISES, HE HAS SHOWN THAT HE IS THE MOST HONEST PRESIDENT EVER. WHO WROTE THAT? WELL, THE AUTHOR OF THAT OP-ED JOINS US NOW A FELLOW AT THE AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTED MARC THIESSEN. GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. STEVE: HE IS THE MOST HONEST PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY, EXPLAIN THAT METRIC TO US. WELL, SO HE IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THE PRESIDENT TAKES LIBERTIES WITH THE TRUTH THOUGH HE WAS CERTAINLY RIGHT ABOUT ELIZABETH WARREN THAT'S FOR SURE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE REAL BAROMETER OF PRESIDENTIAL TRUTHFULNESS WHICH IS PROMISE-KEEPING HE IS PROBABLY THE MOST HONEST PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY FOR BETTER OR WORSE WHETHER YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH HIS POLICIES HE HAS DONE EXACTLY WHAT HE WOULD DO AS PRESIDENT. MOVE THE EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM AND RECOGNIZE AS CAPITAL. THREE ADMINISTRATIONS PROMISED TO DO THAT HE IS THE ONLY ONE DELIVERED. PROMISED TO DESTROY ISIS. HE PROMISED TO IMPOSE A TRAVEL BAN. I PERSONALLY DON'T AGREE WITH THE TRAVEL BADGE. HE PROMISED TO DO AND IT THE SUPREME COURT UPHELD IT. ON THE ECONOMY HE PROMISED A TAX REFORM AND MASSIVE REGULATORY ROLL BACK. HE HAS DONE IT ON ENERGY, HE PROM MISSIONED TO OPEN UP THE ARTIC ANWR AND APPROVE THE KEYSTONE AND DO COAT ACCESS PIPELINES AND PULL OUT OF THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD AND HE HAS DONE IT YOU GO DOWN THE LIST OF THINGS HE PROMISED TO DO HE HAS DONE THEM ONE AFTER ANOTHER. WHEN IT COMES TO HONESTY WHAT AMERICANS EXPECT FROM A PRESIDENT. THEY EXPECT THEM TO KEEP THEIR PROMISES AND DONALD TRUMP DOES THAT EVERY DAY. STEVE: FOR THE THINGS HE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE LIKE THE WALL OR REPEALING OBAMACARE. NO, HE HAS TRIED HARD BUT HE IS IN WASHINGTON. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. HE HAS MADE AN EFFORT AND DEMOCRATIC OBSTRUCTION AND RESISTANCE THAT HAS BLOCKED IT OR IN THE CASE OF OBAMACARE, IT'S BEEN, YOU KNOW, ONE VOTE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. AND THEN WHEN HE HAS PULLED BACK ON THE CAMPAIGN PROMISE LIKE PULLING TROOPS OUT OF AFGHANISTAN, IT WAS AFTER A CAREFUL REVIEW, IF YOU READ BOB WOODWARD'S BOOK, IT'S COMFORTING. TOOK A CAREFUL REVIEW SPENT A LOT OF TIME GRILLING HIS AND THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT A PRESIDENT TO DO. STEVE: HIS JOB APPROVAL NUMBER HAS BEEN GOING UP. ABC NEWS POLL SHOWS TRUMP HAS 41% APPROVAL UP FROM 36% IN AUGUST. MARC, WHEN YOU LOOK AT HEADLINES FROM ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY IN HIS CAMP, THEY GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR THE ECONOMY. CNN, TRUMP IS RIGHT. THE ECONOMY IS DOING WELL ANSWERED DESERVES SOME CREDIT. NPR, U.S. ECONOMY SURGES TO 4.1% PACE SECOND QUARTER IN THE CHICAGO TRIB. THIS IS WHAT A BOOMING ECONOMY FEELS LIKE. THAT'S GOT TO MAKE THE PRESIDENT FEEL LIKE HE IS ON THE RIGHT TRACK. ABSOLUTELY. HERE IS THE RIGHT THING. THE ECONOMY IS RISING 4.2 POURS ECONOMIC GROWTH. BEST MANUFACTURING JOB GROWTH IN 23 YEARS. LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS IN 23 YEARS. THE COMMITTEE IS BOOMING. HIS APPROVAL RATING IS NOT. YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WHY IS THAT? THERE SHOULD BE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO ARE SEEING THE EFFECTS OF THE TRUMP ECONOMY WHO HAVE BEEN LIFTED UP BY THE TRUMP ECONOMY. I OUGHT TO GIVE THIS GUY A SECOND LOOK AND THAT'S NOT HAPPENING. THE QUESTION IS WHY IS THAT? ONE OF THE REASONS IS BECAUSE HE HAS NOT HE HAS BEEN VERY FOCUSED ON FEEDING HIS BASE. HE HAS NOT BEEN AS FOCUSED ON REACHING TOUT PEOPLE WHO DON'T YET AGREE WITH HIM WHO COULD BE COMING. IN HE NEEDS TO DO A BETTER
