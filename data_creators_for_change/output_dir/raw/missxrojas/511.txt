21
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,640
one hundred percent dead and I just felt

22
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,590
like that and I couldn't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything to</font>

bought a chocolate because I eat my

25
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,690
feelings but<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the other thing I'll</font>

26
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,129
say is that there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> scorning like</font>

27
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,980
Spotify feature where you can go on

28
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,110
facebook and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook friends</font>

29
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,399
pay less and then it got me thinking

30
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,140
that that is the feature that already

31
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,910
exists on Spotify we can share playlists

32
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,039
and I'm trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the summary mood</font>

33
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,570
because I feel like the more pins<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

34
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,890
drink and the more some songs i listen

35
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,140
to and the more sunshine ease summer

36
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,760
equids around the more dresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wear</font>

37
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,110
and all of that the quickest summer is
