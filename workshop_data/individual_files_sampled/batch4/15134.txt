okay seriously what is up with liberals obsession with Donald Trump being naked it's getting a little creepy at this point now of course a lot of us thought that the dossier was strange for many many reasons but the whole excerpt about golden showers in the Moscow hotel room the former President Barack Obama stayed in that was just ridiculous and now we have a story coming out that two Russian pranksters reached out to California congressional representative Adam Schiff to offer him naked pictures of Donald Trump I'm not kidding so this happened about a year ago when these two pranksters whose real names I'm probably going to butcher but they are vladimir kuznetsov and alexei Stolyarov called and actually spoke to Adam Schiff who believed that he was talking to a Ukrainian politician now I apologize to our Russian viewers for the name butchering but over the course of the conversation this person discusses with Adam Schiff the existence of these compromising photos and how the Russian government could possibly use them as leverage against the Trump administration to force the u.s. to lift sanctions on the Russians now a lot of liberals are defending chefs saying that of course he knew that the call was a prank but there are elements of this conversation that seemed to suggest that that's simply not the case he even goes so far as to say that our Russian friends could be eavesdropping on the call and told him not to share anything that he wouldn't want them to hear so shift then told the man that his office would work with the appropriate agencies to figure out how we can obtain copies it also damages their case that a member of ship's staff continued communication with the callers after that initial call continuing to seek damaging material on president Trump now the prankster said that they would transfer the material to shift through the Ukrainian embassy in Washington DC I'm sorry but that does not sound like someone who is in on the joke but you know what it does sound like collusion why isn't this a mainstream story it's an American politician digging up dirt on another American through a foreign government or so he thought or so he hoped so why aren't more people talking about this I don't but we're talking about it here at the rebel thanks so much for watching everybody I'm Amanda head the Hollywood conservative for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us over here at the rebels subscribe to our premium content at www.affordablecomm.com you
