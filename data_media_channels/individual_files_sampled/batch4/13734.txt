you have to build a sense of community around something and if you're a religious person like if you ask me what's my community yeah my commute probably the Orthodox Jewish community in which I live right because if God forbid I lost all my money tomorrow yeah people who I'd be going to for charity are those folks but if you're on the Left where's the sense of community coming from except from this shared sense of politics yeah yeah yeah my community is the unicorn community that's like I've noticed that people inside unicorns are like they cut across all like I can have leftists who can't see me but they dig that he's the unicorn guy so it's like just a very strange thing with that but it is true people want communities that the issue is though like you got it like people are too close to the fire yeah whether you're anted like the never Trumper and the always Trumper are can be interchangeable because they're just too close to the fire the only thing we were talking about Andrew Breitbart the only way out of that is humor it's like we talked about you and I talked about this a while ago my podcast said like no matter what how Breitbart would feel about Trump he would find it hilarious no question I'd feel that way about my mother - my mom probably would have started off with the debates and she would go out she'd probably call me up cuz she died five years ago four years she'd be like oh I can't believe what this guy is saying what so did you and then every day would become did you hear what he said and she'd be chuckling and that's how I think he worked on a lot of people was like it was just entertaining and it was funny if he didn't take it seriously and I think that's the key people are taking this too seriously and when you talked about your community that prevents you from taking it too seriously because you have a community that offers you more and I mean it's and also I see this you know III have to check myself you know I'm married I don't have kids I could easily just get full bore and think about this crap all the time I could think about it I could get it I could lie awake it in the middle of the night and think about what am I gonna say and I realize it's really important to let my wife is not political and she'll just say stop it it's not that it's nothing it's stupid she just pokes a hole in it and then I'm gonna write you're right and go out hang out with people go like I love music I do that stuff but I think the distance from this is really really important and that's what my neck after I'm already think about my next book ain't gonna be about politics
