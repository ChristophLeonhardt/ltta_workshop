you watch I think says a lot about you if you're not wearing a watch that's fine it doesn't hurt in any way but I think there is something extra you know given to to the persona and the appearance of a man or woman if they have something really interesting on their wrist the people that I've met the designers the comedians the actors the musicians the people that I've met through watches are amazing and in many cases that the more interesting they are the nicer the watch they wear or at least the more they know about watches so I think it just is one more way to tell somebody that that you have kind of a point of view that you have some version of self-expression and that you have an understanding of a tradition and of craftsmanship new watches offer many things that vintage watches do not and vice versa a new watch especially if you buy new from an authorized dealer really becomes a part of you and you become a part of it in the sense that this watch never lived before it came into your life so your names on the papers you know everything honor is correct and original you become a part of its history organically which you don't necessarily get with a new watch is some of the charm of having something old and also maybe some of the investment properties that you get with vintage watches the vintage watch buyer is everyone you know I've seen it change dramatically since we've been doing this in the beginning it was often very you know wealthy elegant European men too now certainly more Americans well well younger than you know we were looking at before right now I think everybody is a vintage watch buyer I've seen young women I've seen 16 year-old kids buy vintage watches I've seen celebrities buy them that were never buying them before I think people are starting to understand the appeal of vintage watches in a way that that is totally new and that's why I think that the new watch world is suffering a little bit because of it
