I'm joined now by Charlie Sykes MSNBC contributor and longtime conservative commentator and NPR TV critic and MSNBC contributor Eric Fagan's gentlemen thank you very much charlie first to you what do you make of the reciprocal anger from Trump the White House and conservatives towards Samantha P we are in a downward spiral of incivility I think it's very very revealing that after this textbook case of racism that we got from Roseanne Barr the response from the White House of course was not to express outrage or concern but simply to say well what about this liberal comedian who by the way also cross the line also cross the line and it was also by the way since we're talking about comedians grossly unfunny this is part of the problem but I think you know this is this is what would you get the degraded political culture and dialogues that we're getting that you do have these dueling apocrypha oh by the way how incredibly hypocritical is it for the Trump White House we're talking with a trump White House expressing indignation and outrage over sexist slurs and I think you I think yeah okay you probably saw that particular c-word displayed at Trump rallies that you covered throughout 2016 so there's a little bit of a fake posturing going on oh I did and here's the thing about that word while I have never heard Donald Trump say it he did call Ted Cruz the P word on stage and he called said Hillary Hillary Clinton was schlonged by Obama he's got a long history of saying these things but when it comes particularly to or specifically to that word I never saw the president call out anybody in any of his crowds and say to that person hey this is this is too far this is not okay you can't do it he almost condoned it he certainly capitalized on that sort of anger and behavior in order to propel himself to the White House Eric what do you think why hasn't the White House come out though and and tried to take a if they want to take a moral stand against Samantha B should they have taken one with Roseanne Barr first well I mean obviously this is a white house that goes after the people that they feel are attacking them and they viewed Roseann as an ally and that's why they haven't spoken out against her but I think it's a mistake to focus too much on who used what word when Samantha B has admitted that she made a mistake in using that word and I think she did but I think what is important is you have to look at a broadcaster or a performers history do they have a history of using sexist language of demeaning women of saying things that are racist or homophobic or Islamophobic and in rows and bars case she had a history of saying things on social media that were in a similar vein she had said she compared former Obama aide Susan Rice also another black woman to to an ape she had said disturbing things about Islam and she'd also retweeted conspiracy theories so - I don't think you can compare the two cases simply because Samantha bee admitted that she crossed the line but when you look at her history her reports and her comedy have been about looking out for women's issues about highlighting when women are oppressed or when women are held back and she crossed the line in using this word and she has apologized for it so I think these two things are very different are we perhaps in peril going down a slippery slope if we continue to demand apologies from from comedians comedians I think their job I think the really envelope not to say that this is pushing the envelope but I think the real problem I think the real problem that we have here is we're focusing on the wrong issues it's not so much about the use of an individual word in the case of Roseanne Barr and what she did it's about echoing a trope of stereotyping comparing black people to Apes that we have been dealing with for hundreds of years and that it's been wrapped inside a lot of our media for many years and so trying to eradicate that systemic prejudice trying to get people to understand that comparing black people the Apes echoes a prejudice that has been used to hold people black for hundreds of years that's a much different thing than a comedian use a word that crosses the line and trying to and I think some people are trying to conflate these things because they don't want to have that discussion about systemic prejudice they don't want to have that discussion about when when a performer says something that reflects a wider problem in society I don't think anyone thinks that that Samantha bee was trying to reach out to sexist in the audience by using that word and so we are talking about two different things here and and I don't I think the effort to conflate them is an effort effort to make Roseanne look like she was just cracking an off-color joke rather than doing something that was much more damaged Charlie I'm old enough to remember when Donald Trump ran on being politically incorrect and run ran against those who are clutching their pearls at everything well exactly and of course you know he in fact has you know created an environment which people feel that they can push these lines I mean you know go back and look by the way at the Twitter Peter dinesh d'souza who just got these at the part of the kinds of things that he said you know referring to Barack Obama as that you know way out of the ghetto and things like that but you know going to this point of the danger of having a double standard look they're not equivalent I'm not arguing that they are equivalent the Trump white outs I think is very cynically using Samantha bee in order to take attention away from the racism of somebody who was touted by the president United States but on the other hand you know isn't this kind of a moment to realize that if you want to have a higher moral of you know standard here if you want to have that the higher ground then then don't find a way to excuse bolder sexist language you know as opposed to vulgar racist language and and I'm not saying that they were equivalent because I don't think they are but I do think that there's a real danger for people falling into kind of this double standard and by the way it's you know hypocrisy Olympics all the way around here what's let's also remind people that Samantha B was talking very specifically about a trump policy that was just enacted at the border ripping families apart and here's what her her statement about about that says today the White House is war on the full-frontal host so ever calling more public attention to the you know what that's not the right one I'm sorry right here we spent the day wrestling with the repercussions of one bad word when we all should have spent the day incest that and sense that as a nation we are wrenching children from their parents and treating people legally seeking asylum as criminals Charlie doesn't she have a point well yes but but that in some ways indict her use of the word because it is legitimate to talk about what's happening to children on the border this policy of the new cruelty but in head in fact she not used that word maybe we would be talking about that see this is where you undermine you blow yourself up you make yourself less persuasive yeah and by you know and again you know comedians first of all should be funny if she wants to be an activist she should try to actually advance the cause rather than provide this kind of a distraction for the cause I gotta say this is the Trump administration of course has now seized the promised that we're not talking about why did the president United States why did a major Network promote someone who you know a vile racist like Roseanne Barr by the way this was completely predictable but instead of that we are talking about the what about ISM and that's self-inflicted you-know-what and and I gotta say the the Samantha B word blue that immigration story out of my rundown the other day so don't worry we're gonna be talking about it we're getting it back and I promise it's important Charlie Sykes Eric bagans thank you very much hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our
