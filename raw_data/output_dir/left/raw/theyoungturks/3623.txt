1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:03,250
I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT FOR YOU
GUYS.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,790
HENCE THE BUGLE.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:10,690
WE ARE STARTING TYT
INVESTIGATES.

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:15,620
I DON'T THINK THAT IS WHAT I'M
SUPPOSED TO DO WHEN I'M INTROING

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,500
A SEGMENT ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING
TO DO OBJECTIVE JOURNALISM.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,410
DO NOT WORRY, I'M NOT THE ONE
DOING IT.

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,179
REMEMBER GUYS, WE RAISED TWO
MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE

8
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:28,320
AUDIENCE, FROM YOU GUYS AND TO
DO MORE INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,409
WELL, THOSE FOLKS WERE UNDER TYT
POLITICS.

10
00:00:31,409 --> 00:00:32,720
WE GOT GOOD NEWS FOR YOU.

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,039
WE'RE DOING TO CHANNELS FOR THE
PRICE OF ONE NOW.

12
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:37,350
TYT POLITICS WILL REMAIN AS
IT IS AND IT WILL COVER

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,760
PROGRESSIVE CANDIDATES, CAUSES,
PROTESTS, RALLIES, JUST

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,969
LIKE IT'S ALWAYS DONE, AND
THE NEW CHANNEL NOW THAT IS

15
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:47,050
STARTING CALLED TYT
INVESTIGATES, AND THAT IS

16
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,589
FOR HARD-CORE, INVESTIGATIVE
JOURNALISM.

17
00:00:50,589 --> 00:00:53,260
SO WE'RE GOING TO LOOK INTO SOME
OF THE LARGEST COMPANIES IN THE

18
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,059
WORLD AND IN THIS COUNTRY, WE'RE
GOING TO LOOK INTO CERTAINLY THE

19
00:00:56,059 --> 00:00:58,800
LARGEST POLITICIANS IN THIS
COUNTRY, SOME OF THE BUREAUCRATS

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,239
WHO ARE MAKING THE DECISION.

21
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,239
WE'RE GOING TO COVER THE HARD

22
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:04,629
STORIES THAT UNFORTUNATELY I
BELIEVE A LOT OF THE

23
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:09,660
ESTABLISHMENT MEDIA STILL LEAVES
UNCOVERED AND I REMEMBER THE

24
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,490
TIME I WAS AT MSNBC AND I WANTED
TO INVESTIGATE A STORY ABOUT RON

25
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,750
PAUL AND, I TOLD YOU
GUYS ABOUT THIS, AND I WAS

26
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,440
LOOKING AND I COULDN'T FIND ONE
INVESTIGATIVE REPORT AT MSNBC.

27
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,550
THERE WAS ONE GUY WHO WAS
WORKING FOR ANOTHER NETWORK AND

28
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,310
HE

29
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,270
DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO CHASE DOWN
STORY FOR MSNBC ANCHORS.

30
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,730
THEY DON'T HAVE INVESTIGATIVE
REPORTER IN THE BUILDING.

31
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,730
THEY HAVE PEOPLE GO OUT ON
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, THEY ARE

32
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,930
PEOPLE WHO GO AND ASK QUESTIONS
AT PRESS CONFERENCES, BUT

33
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,310
THIS WAS NO INVESTIGATIVE
REPORTING DONE AT THE CABLE

34
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,280
NEWS STATIONS, SEE THE STEP TO
THE PLATE THAT YOU HELPED
