recently the Environmental Protection Agency released a statement indicating that they are allowing for the deregulation of the coal industry and the way that coal power plants dispose of coal ash now these are Obama era protections meant to protect our drinking water from toxic coal ash but the Trump administration and especially Scott Pruett who runs the EPA or is the head of the EPA didn't like those regulations and decided that maybe it's up for up to the states to decide what those laws should be so according to reports the Environmental Protection Agency will scrap these Obama era rules governing coal ash disposal so the changes would provide companies with annual compliance cost savings of 100 million dollars so of course I mean look of course they want to cut corners and and save a ton of money a hundred million dollars now coal fire coal-fired power plants in the United States produce around 140 million tons of coal ash per year the waste is usually started in wet ponds almost half of which operate without liners and other safeguards meant to prevent chemicals from seeping into groundwater so if you want to know how damaging that is to our health and especially to for children an EPA study from 2010 showed that people living within one mile of unlined coal ash ponds can have a 1 in 50 risk of cancer more than 2000 times higher than what the EPA considers acceptable and it's as hazardous as smoking a pack of cigarettes a day and when it comes to children there are about 1.5 million children at risk who live near coal ash disposal sites and it's shown to increase the risk of children developing learning disabilities birth defects asthma and cancer by the way people in Flint Michigan are still dealing with lead in their drinking water its 2018 so yeah so Paul gee Swearingen is running against Joe Manchin in a primary and Democratic side in West Virginia and I bring her up only because she often talks about how it's not too much to ask for it jobs and not to poison our kids and that's the the conundrum that the Republican party seems to constantly put you in you're either gonna have hot jobs and we're gonna poison your kids or we're not gonna poison your kids but you're not gonna have any jobs I think we can do better I'm positive we can do better so for example coal creates 160,000 jobs in the country that's how many there are in the coal industry solar has 260 thousand jobs far more and solar doesn't poison your kids so I just it's one option but in terms of what we should do in this case so they do these unlined coal ash ponds and I asked Joe Manchin he was nice enough to come on for an interview we had an interesting conversation but I asked him about his donors one of his donors is has been brought up for leaking into ponds and streams and and he helped to deregulate leaking into ponds and streams and he said oh I don't know who my donors are okay I mean that's just one example but all these politicians are like Oh golly gee did I help deregulate these industries and and look at one point they in this particular article that I was reading they were saying you know it's possible that it'll leak into the groundwater if it's unlined and you put it in a pond of course it'll leak into the groundwater of course it will and so that's why you have the results that you have does anybody want to live in an area that has all this arsenic lead selenium that is so damaging birth defects etc that is they have it at rates two thousand times the rate of what is considered acceptable do you want your kids living in that area so when they say oh don't worry we'll just give all the breaks to the corporations it'll trickle down on you sometimes what trickles down on you is arsenic right exactly and and the whole point of the government and this is always you know the philosophical debate that people have regarding the role of the government the the main role is to protect the citizens right and the Trump administration especially when it comes to deregulating Environmental Protection's does exact the exact opposite of protecting us these environmental regulations weren't put in place as a form of government overreach it was put in place or they were put in place to protect our drinking water to protect our environment as a whole to at least try to slow down some of the damage that we've already done to the planet and this is a this is a situation that's gonna affect all of us this is groundwater this is drinking water why would anyone think that it's a good idea to deregulate an industry so they can make more money and cut more corners and simultaneously destroy the drinking water in certain parts of the country it's insane and so you know when the Trump administration when Trump specifically talks about how he's looking out for the little guy he's never looking out for the little guy never never first of all he wants to undo anything that Obama has done because he has held a grudge and will not let it go but more importantly when it comes to other members of his administration and other you know players in the right wing they all they care about is their donors you know they probably even believe that climate change is something that is real and man-made but it doesn't matter as long as they are getting paid by certain industries they are gonna do whatever it takes to deregulate and and serve them as opposed to Americans one last quote from apology and Spurgeon and we'll have our links down below so you can check her out if you're interested in being your own West Virginia in particular she said if someone else poisoned our waters and poisoned our kids this way we'd go to war over it but we left corporations do it because they donate to politicians it's crazy
