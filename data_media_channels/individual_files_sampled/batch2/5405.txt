good morning and welcome to Andrew we are indeed live here in DC we're just two hours from now an estimated half a million people will gather just blocks from the White House for the March for our lives rally for gun reform this event has been organized by students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who lost 17 classmates and school staff to a killing spree by a former classmate wielding an ar-15 assault rifle inside the school on Valentine's Day the survivors have turned their shock and their grief into action and an all-out rejection of the typical tired response to mass shootings in America violence so just behind me even as we speak many of the parkland activists are gathering with hundreds of thousands of fellow students including kids from the DC area who've lived with the trauma of gun violence in their communities for years and years and they're joined by thousands more who are rallying and more than eight hundred siblings marches across the country they're still calling BS on the status quo and their young voices will be heard joining me now right here in Washington DC is MSNBC's don't remain Lee Tremaine tell me what's happening where you are I'll tell you what joy what is amazing is that we're still two hours out and we're expecting hundreds of thousands of people to be here in DC but there are already tens of thousands I don't know if you can see behind me this crowd stretches back several hundred yards people from all over the country I spoke to a family from North Carolina and Virginia and New York and one thing one theme that has been common throughout is that of the the adults in the situation the parents all refer their questions to the children they said they wanted to end gun violence enough is enough even young people who have never been politically active have been engaged by this when I talked to some folks from DC yesterday a family who lost a a brother a young man lost his twin brother to gun violence he said it doesn't matter if a mass shooting in parkland or somewhere else in the country or urban gun violence this needs to end and again will you hear a time again again is that parents say we haven't gotten the job done in generations perhaps it's time for the young people to lead again already you can feel the excitement out here folks who have travelled far and wide one to make sure they get here early now we're a few hundred yards from the stage here where throughout the day there will be speakers and you know people singing and performing different acts but the drawl here today is that folks want to hear get their voices out there but what is amazing it's generations different people from different cultures and geography I saw one sign that said gays for gun control you have young people that says with signs and say you know love love our children not our guns and so already two hours away and already I would say tens of thousands of people out here joy it's gonna be an exciting day because the the energy the emotion the passion these young people have had enough quite frankly joy MSNBC's sure mainly Thank You Man weekend are we're gonna keep checking in with you live throughout the show thank you very much appreciate it and joining me now from parkland Florida where there's a sister March being held today is NBC's Maya Rodriguez Maya give us the update where you are a pine trails park we're only about a mile away from Marjory Stoneman Douglas look at all the signs that we have here we have one year that says we call BS of course that's become a bit of a rallying cry out here after what Emma Gonzalez said in that famous speech which was just a little bit over a month ago they are expecting between twenty and thirty thousand people here marching from this park all the way over to the high school joining me right now is Samantha and Arianna schlissel thank you guys so much for being here you guys are not students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas but you are students here in Broward County why was it so important for you to come out here today because I'm here to support my community and support everyone who um next generation and this is our generation that is fighting for what is right these are necessities that need to happen this is not what our government should be like we need unity and this is what we're fighting for here today and that is why we are here to come and support everything that happened 59 days ago can you believe it's just been 59 days and how quickly all this has organized no I can I feels like it was a year ago in this past couple months know from history nothing has ever happened this fast before and that's because of us and our generation as we have and the impact that we have on today's society and this is why we are here today supporting our community what would you like to see happen now I know that everyone is sort of reaching out to their lawmakers they want to see something change what do you want to see change everything that everyone else wants to see change I'm on I'm all behind their backs I want gun the assault rifles be gone like they should not be here only people who are trained to use them should be using them that's it not only assault rifles but more laws on gun control in general all guns are there for to protect us and not everyone should have their hands on them it doesn't need to be that way we don't need to live in fear and need guns to support ourselves and to keep ourselves safe that's not what we're about here in America all right Samantha Arianna show so thank you so much for joining us and as you can see joy tens of thousands of people expect to be filling the park here they're going to be marching about a mile down all this is getting started in just a few minutes with the program here back to you joy absolutely NBC's Maya Rodriguez thank you so much really appreciate and joining me now is Valerie Jarrett former senior advisor to President Barack Obama and Valerie this is amazing unbelievable just look behind us incredible and I want to put up a map of all of the places all the cities where March for our lives rallies are taking place worldwide it's incredible that these kids about 20 of the kids from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in parkland Florida were the impetus for putting together this march and eventual we'll get that map up to show I mean eight hundred some-odd SeaWorld well the point is it's not just Washington focused it is spreading as you said around our country and the world yes and these young people out of tragedy out of profound grief have started a revolution you cannot stop them now and you know what I just met a young man who lost his brother two years ago from Chicago yeah and he said I'm doing this for my brother yeah he can't be here I want to make sure nobody else loses their brother and so there's a motion and profound pain but also just energy yeah enthusiasm absolutely and it's not Washington focus but it is definitely sending a message to that Capitol it is letting Washington and know that these kids some of them are not even old enough to vote but their parents can vote they're gonna turn eighteen they're very focused on the politics here and they've attracted attention from celebrities and all sorts of people President Barack Obama who you worked for who was our for our previous president actually sent a letter a letter did mrs. Obama yeah he and mrs. Obama sent a letter to the students they've even attracted his attention talk a little about this because I am struck by the fact that I will never forget President Obama you know as a father just breaking down really talking about the Sandy Hook children were killed it was our worst day at eight years and nothing happened well that's exactly right well nothing happened in Washington but I will say a lot happened in the Sandy Hook community yes they've organized an entire effort Sandy Hook promise design to try to alert young people to recognize mental illness after Gabby Giffords was shot she and her husband Mark Kelly started an effort every town there are initiatives in my hometown of Chicago you and I were just in New York we heard what they've been doing there yeah so a lot of this work has been going on for time yep but it didn't capture the energy that you're seeing now what do you get momentum now what do these kids have what are they what do they have that so special they have mastered social media yeah that's my sense first of all they're smart they're fearless yeah they don't care about the NRA they're not getting any money from the NRA oh and they've been through a tragedy and they're motivated and they know how to use this powerful tool yeah and let's face it this is a new age you and I unfortunately our little data we're just we were just but they know how to do it yeah and so they're not dependent on getting a permission getting the press to pay attention to them they are empowered and that empowerment makes them believe they can actually make a difference here and I also like one of the young people yesterday said this is the beginning of a marathon yes so they're not looking for just a quick fix there realistically Oh what's gonna take time yep they're not taking no for an answer you know you and I were talking earlier about how this is in addition to showing people the meaning of activism and sticking to it this is an incredible example of what good public schools yes with teachers who were dedicated I mean this is the public school system in Broward I don't II thought at it's been why does not every young person around our country have that at that opportunity that opportunity good education yeah and also they are they are amazing public speaker they really are and they're poised yes get nervous you know intimidated at all anything at all they're so smart and they've been so impressive to talk about some of the changes you mentioned the changes have been taking place in the States there is a little bit of change Oregon has banned people convicted of stalking or domestic violence we're under a restraining order some from buying or owning guns ramune ition that passed on February 22nd this massacre was February 14th in Rhode Island they've already established a red flag policy on guns that will help keep guns away from people who could pose significant threats to public safety that pass on February 27th Florida the hardest state to pass gun reform in in the country because of the NRA power there March 9th they sound immodest bill but it has a three day waiting period to buy a gun at raise the age to buy a rifle 221 one last one Washington state banned the sale news of bump stocks on March 6 these kids have gotten much more done than we really since Columbine in 1990 that's absolutely right and then they're just beginning yeah their strategic they're going state-by-state but they're also gonna be right here in Washington and they're recognizing their power yeah their influence just look at all of the companies that stopped yes advertising if with the NRA that happened because of these young people solutely give the companies that are donating I'm on the board of lifts they're offering free rides yeah everybody's getting in there yeah and so I think that shows you what can happen do you feel like this could change the culture one of the things that's been so pernicious is this gun culture in the country do you see that starting maybe to change because of this I certainly hope so I know we've heard from you and I both have heard from a lot of people who carry guns who say look I'm willing to put down my assault weapon I don't need this I don't need to have target practice I'd rather have a young person live yeah and really you're just weighing public policies what's more important to yeah having children be able to go to school I mean I don't have my daughter is grown so I didn't realize until recently schools are having training sessions yeah you know my kids went home in Florida active shooter chatting session yeah is that really what we want for our children oh we want that I'll just go there and learn absolutely not and you know as a parent myself who had kids in Broward County Schools having to have that meeting where you meet in a park so that you know where to meet your kids if there's an active shooter in your school it's ridiculous no other country in the world does this to their children no other country and you see that countries like Australia yeah they had one tragedy change the law right just like that well you know what we're changing things here these kids are amazing you can hear the music starting behind this is gonna be a concert here today Valerie Jarrett it's always great to talk thank you thank you buddy the bear whether that family man comes out thank you so much sir we have so much more live coverage of the March for our lives right here on MSNBC don't go away to die and have their blood spilt in American
