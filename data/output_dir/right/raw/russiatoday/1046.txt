for two years which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult really</font>

11
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:28,960
really difficult because competitive

23
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,170
these things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect from a player</font>

26
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,030
that's not something every player has he

27
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,740
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the opportunity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is something</font>

28
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">about his mentality when when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they when</font>

29
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:13,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">he was shot in in the fence</font>

30
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,110
and he took<font color="#CCCCCC"> that opportunity to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> score</font>

31
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,450
two goals against Saudi Arabia<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he</font>

32
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,130
just took off<font color="#CCCCCC"> from that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font>

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,420
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal that was scored</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the next</font>

34
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,640
court was him again<font color="#E5E5E5"> he popped up and</font>

35
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,220
then he wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing against Spain but</font>

36
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,740
came on played well<font color="#E5E5E5"> scored on one of the</font>

37
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,830
presences and<font color="#E5E5E5"> today started the game</font>

38
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,409
scored again<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a guy that has</font>

39
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:37,100
now made a really big name<font color="#CCCCCC"> for himself</font>

40
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">places Villarreal</font>

41
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:43,229
he won't be playing for Villarreal next

42
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,490
season<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think so</font>

43
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,709
he's in Spain the bigger clubs will be

44
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:48,600
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> him but there will be other</font>

45
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,759
clubs again that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are dollar bid</font>

46
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">for instance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big big rumors that he has</font>

47
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:58,470
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> made</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a deal with Chelsea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so this</font>

48
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,360
is another one who's made a really big

49
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,049
name friend so I keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> faith people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

50
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:07,350
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> his his his knees that they're not</font>

51
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">very good but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I saw nothing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong with</font>

52
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,140
this before

53
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">championship</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so maybe even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's an</font>

54
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">opportunity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for him</font>

55
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">Maya Fernandez my probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my favorite</font>

56
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,410
playing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> championship frozen and</font>

57
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:27,040
super starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> story came in the opening</font>

58
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,620
game scored on is very very first<font color="#E5E5E5"> charge</font>

59
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,600
against Saudi Arabia<font color="#E5E5E5"> and she's kept</font>

60
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,870
going and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have this big big guy a</font>

61
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,300
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> big guy in terms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know our</font>

62
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,000
field player our field players and he's

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,230
technical<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good he he's physically</font>

64
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,020
very good<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't see him as tired</font>

65
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,480
today but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's what managers do</font>

66
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,120
they have planned<font color="#CCCCCC"> their subtlety so he's</font>

67
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,459
just the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> you take off and I think in</font>

68
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:57,190
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways successive will regret taking</font>

69
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,870
you know because he would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been gold</font>

70
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,470
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that except half an hour</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but he's</font>

71
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,020
another one<font color="#E5E5E5"> who has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just shown himself</font>

72
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the world and it's going to be very</font>

73
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what's gonna happen</font>

74
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">with these players</font>

75
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,300
I've got to ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> you because they're</font>

76
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">playing that song we are the champions</font>

77
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">we got 14s left now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got France against</font>

78
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,730
Belgium England against Croatia

79
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">out of those four well we'll be the</font>

80
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,459
champions in European well if we go by

81
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:27,590
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've seen in terms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of play and</font>

82
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,220
then I I know means does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> count for</font>

83
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,430
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> now but then a Belgium Croatia</font>

84
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:38,600
final will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one that is you know</font>

85
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,880
the most realistic one because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

86
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,920
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> teams that has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> played the best</font>

87
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,690
football<font color="#CCCCCC"> they've had the best what</font>

88
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:49,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">they've been consistent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

89
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,250
mass graves are<font color="#CCCCCC"> playing England England</font>

90
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,850
has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've been they've been very</font>

91
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">very good at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what they've been given but</font>

92
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:00,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't think we've seen England under</font>

93
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,850
pressure<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet</font>

94
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,610
so obviously Croatia<font color="#E5E5E5"> depending on uh how</font>

95
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,950
much energy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they had left</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in four</font>

96
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,010
days time I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think can we use the phrase</font>

97
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,700
battle-hardened when you've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

98
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,280
two sets of extra time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> she tells</font>

99
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,290
does it involved a new strength in you I

100
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,540
think so yeah absolutely

101
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">honestly I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

102
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:22,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">count for anything once we get to is in</font>

103
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,780
four<font color="#E5E5E5"> days of rest and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everything</font>

104
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">I wasn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ready to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in unless they've</font>

105
00:04:27,120 --> 00:00:00,000
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> injury</font>
