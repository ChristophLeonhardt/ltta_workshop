use three words to describe this operation precise overwhelming and effective at the Pentagon claims of success as they roll out slides to show what they say is total destruction of three chemical weapon sites in Syria a research facility a bunker and a storage area in all 105 missiles and bombs fired from us British and French ships submarines and aircraft the Pentagon says Russia didn't try to fire back and they claim all of Syria's attempts to shoot them down failed we've attacked the heart of the Syrian chemical weapons program and I'm not saying they're not gonna be able to reconstitute it their very own I'm not saying that it's going to continue but this is Delta MAV Airi serious blow so but I think it's that's the core of what I'm saying u.s. president Donald Trump was quick to claim victory on Twitter writing mission accomplished a spokesperson here at the Pentagon tried to clarify that rather broad statement saying this particular mission was successful or accomplished they admit though they didn't destroy all of Syria's suspected chemical weapons Russia and Syria have denied that chemical weapons were used investigators from the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons arrived in Syria hours after the strikes the US says it didn't need to wait for their findings they have evidence enough but they've provided none of it to the public when a lot of this has to do with intelligence and and I'm very happy to show evidence if I can but we were very confident about the decisions we make the u.s. is not saying this is over they say that depends entirely on what the Assad government decides to do next patty : al Jazeera at the Pentagon
