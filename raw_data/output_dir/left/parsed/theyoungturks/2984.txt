TODAY IS TAXABLE DAY AND THE
GOP HAS ALREADY PASSED THE HOUSE
BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT ABOUT AN
HOUR AND HALF AGO THEY DECIDED
THEY WERE SEVERAL PROBLEMS
WITH THE BILL.
ITS NAME WAS INACCURATE AS
BERNIE SANDERS POINTED OUT,
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO CHANGE IT.
THERE'S ALSO ISSUES WITH
COMPONENTS OF THE BILL THAT
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH
THE BUDGET RECONCILIATION
PROCESS THEY ARE USING TO MOVE
THIS THROUGH WITH ONLY 51
VOTES RATHER THAN 60.
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF SMALL
TECHNICAL CHANGES.
THE BILL WOULD BE REVOTE ON
TOMORROW, BUT IT IS EXPECTED
TO PASS.
TONIGHT WE HAVE THE SENATE
VOTING ON IT THAT IS WHAT
PEOPLE'S
HOPES TO STOP THE BILL REMAIN.
THE ENTIRE THING IS STILL
SHROUDED IN ALL THIS
CONTROVERSY, ESPECIALLY THE
CORKER AMENDMENT FACT THAT MANY
INDIVIDUALS LIKE CORKER AND OF
COURSE PRES.
TRUMP ARE GOING TO
MAKE A TON OF MONEY BECAUSE THIS
NEW ADDITION OF THE BILL
SPECIFICALLY AIDS PEOPLE WHO
HAVE LARGE REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS
BUT VERY FEW EMPLOYEES WHICH IS
SUPPOSED TO BE THE EXACT
OPPOSITE OF HOW TAX INCENTIVES
WORK, IT IS SUPPOSED TO BENEFIT
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY.
>> CAN I JUST SAY HOW PROUD I AM
OF DAVID SIROTA WHO IS A TYT
CONTRIBUTOR.
HE WROTE IT FOR THE IB TIMES AND
THEN TALKED ABOUT IT ON THE
YOUNG TURKS.
HE BROKE THAT STORY.
AND NOW EVERYONE IS CALLING OUT
REPUBLICANS FOR WHAT IS A CLEAR
GIVEAWAY TO NOT ONLY CORKER BUT
TO TRUMP, CORKER.
IN THE OLD DAYS WITH JUST TV
THEY WOULD'VE EASILY GOTTEN
AWAY WITH IT BUT WITH THE
INTERNET AND WITH ALL THESE
GREAT REPORTERS OUT THERE THEY
WERE CAUGHT RED-HANDED.
>>WE WILL HAVE A SIMILAR ONE THE
FACT THAT ONE OF THE THINGS IN
THIS BILL IT THAT REMAINS IS THE
CARRIED INTEREST TAX LOOPHOLE
WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT FOR SO LONG.
I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT ON
THE SHOW BEFORE.
THE BASIC IDEA IS THAT IF YOU
ARE MANAGING INVESTMENT MONEY
YOU GET A CERTAIN FEE BASED ON
THE SIZE OF THE FUND AND YOU
ALSO GET A PERCENTAGE OF THE
PROFITS THAT ARE EARNED ON THAT
FUND.
THE WAY THE LAW IS RIGHT NOW
YOU'RE TAXED AT A HIGHER
PERCENTAGE ON THE FIRST PART
THAN THE SECOND PART AND THE
REASON HISTORICALLY THAT THE
CARRIED INTEREST IS TAXED AT A
LOWER RATE IS BECAUSE IT SHOULD
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BE WILLING
TO INVEST MORE OF THEIR
OWN MONEY.
BUT THE PEOPLE MANAGING THE
FUNDS, IT IS NOT THEIR MONEY,
THERE IS NO RISK TO THE CAPITAL
WHATSOEVER SO IT MAKES NO SENSE.
THAT IS WHY IT IS ONE OF THE
ICONIC TAX LOOPHOLES THEY BEEN
TALKING ABOUT CLOSING
FOR A LONG TIME.
ALTHOUGH WE HAVE OTHER ELEMENTS
OF THIS BILL WE WANT TO TALK
ABOUT I WANT TO SHOW YOU VIDEO
WITH REPRESENTATIVE BRADY, A
REPUBLICAN, WHO WILL ATTEMPT TO
DO SOME MENTAL JUJITSU TO GET
YOU TO MOVE ON FROM THE FACT
THAT THIS UNNECESSARY TAX
LOOPHOLE REMAINS.
>> WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT FOR
THE NEXT HOUR IF YOU WOULD LIKE,
BUT FOR MOST AMERICANS THEY CAN
CARE LESS ABOUT THAT, THEY CARE
ABOUT THEIR PAYCHECKS AND
GETTING THE ECONOMY GOING AND
FRANKLY I HAVE A COLLEGE SON AS
WELL, ABOUT MAKING SURE THEY
HAVE A GOOD PAYING JOB WHEN THEY
ARE DONE WITH SCHOOL.
>>WE CAN HOLD PUT BOTH OF THESE
THOUGHTS IN HER HEAD THE SAME
TIME.
WHAT ABOUT CARRIED INTEREST HERE
BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW THIS GOES TO
VERY WEALTHY PEOPLE HERE IN NEW
YORK AND MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.
WHY IS IT STILL IN THE BILL?
>> THREE-YEAR HOLDING PERIOD TO
MAKE SURE THOSE FUNDS ARE NOT
USING AND FLIPPING Ã± MAKING SURE
YOU HAVE CAPITAL AT RISK, THAT
YOU HOLD IT FOR A LONG PERIOD OF
TIME AND THEN HE WORKED TO GROW
IT, ALL THAT IS A REASON BEHIND
IT BUT AGAIN PERFECT EXAMPLE I
THINK OF WHY WASHINGTON AND
NEW YORK GET CAUGHT UP IN ALL
THESE ANCILLARY ISSUES AND
FORGET THE BIG PICTURE HERE.
>> SOME NOTHING IN WHAT SLEEPY
LEX LUTHER EXPLAINS IT.
IT IS STILL NOT YOUR MONEY.
>> LET ME GO INTO MORE DETAIL.
I KIND OF LIKE HIS ANSWER
BECAUSE HE'S BASICALLY SAYING
LOOK REGULAR PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THIS SO HUSH UP.
HE SAYING BASICALLY WHAT DOES A
GIVEAWAY TO OUR DONORS AND WE
DON'T THINK THE AVERAGE AMERICAN
UNDERSTANDS IT SO WE ARE JUST
GOING TO SNEAK IT IN.
YOU CAN'T DEFEND IT ALL YOU CAN
SAY AS REGULAR AMERICANS DON'T
KNOW ABOUT IT SO PLEASE BE QUIET
AND THAT IS WHY THEY DON'T
CARE ABOUT IT.
I'M JUST GOING TO FILL IN WHAT
JOHN SAID A LITTLE BIT MORE.
IF I GIVE MY MONEY FOR A HEDGE
FUND TO INVEST AND THEY MAKE ME
20 BUCKS TO THEIR INVESTORS,
NICE JOB.
THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO
INCENTIVIZE FOR ME TO INVEST
THEY WILL LET ME PAY A
LOWER TAX ON THE $20.
THE REALITY IS RICH PEOPLE DON'T
NEED AN INCENTIVE TO INVEST,
YOU MAKE MONEY BY INVESTING.
WARREN BUFFETT HAS SAID THIS SO
MANY TIMES, IT IS PREPOSTEROUS
TO CLAIM THAT IF YOU DON'T GIVE
TAX INCENTIVES WHICH PEOPLE
WILL JUST SIT ON THEIR
MONEY AND DO NOTHING.
THAT IS NOT HOW IT WORKS.
THIS IS AN EXTRA LAYER OF
OBSERVANT SURGERY.
THE HEDGE FUND WHO DID NOT RISK
ANY MONEY, THEY MADE 20% OF THE
PROFIT BECAUSE THAT IS
THEIR JOB TO INVEST.
AND HOW I AM GOING TO GET
COMPENSATED IS TAKING 20% OF
WHAT I MADE.
IT INCENTIVIZES THEM, BUT
THAT IS THEIR JOB.
IT IS IN ESSENCE A SALARY FOR
THEM, A WAGE FOR THEM.
THEY ARE NOT RISKING ANY OF
THEIR OWN MONEY AS AN
INVESTMENT.
IT DOES NOT SPUR ANY INVESTMENT,
ALL IT DOES IS HAVE A TAX BREAK
FOR HEDGE FUND GUYS AND SOME OF
THEM DO A GREAT JOB, SOME A BAD
JOB BUT THEY GET COMPENSATED
RICHLY FOR IT.
THEY DON'T NEED AN EXTRA TAX
BREAK AND ONE THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE STATED PURPOSE OF
CREATING MORE INVESTMENTS.
THAT IS WHY KEVIN BRADY
CANNOT DEFEND IT.
THE HEDGE FUND ONE, REMEMBER
TRUMP PROMISED VERY CLEARLY ON
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL BUT HE
WOULD TAKE THIS AWAY.
HE WAS LYING AND NOW THEY ARE
NOT TAKING IT AWAY AND IT IS
STRICTLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF
THEIR DONORS.
>>I ONLY MENTION THIS BECAUSE IN
THE END OF THE LAST HOUR YOU
PLAYED A PREDICTION.
I WILL MAKE A PREDICTION.
AFTER A DEBATE WHEN HE SAID HE
WOULD GET RID OF THAT AND HE WAS
GETTING ALL THIS CREDIT AS BEING
DIFFERENT AS OTHER REPUBLICANS
ON TAXES I SAID IT WOULD NOT
HAPPEN, BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO
