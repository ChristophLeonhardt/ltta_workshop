1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,280
A STORY OUT OF THE NEW YORK
TIMES EXPLAINING HOW NOW TO

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,940
BE FAIR, BUT A LOT OF DIFFERENT
REPUBLICANS ARE ANGLING TO

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:07,940
RUN IN 2020.

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,700
WAIT A
MINUTE, THERE IS A REPUBLICAN

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,190
PRESIDENT HE WOULD BE UP FOR A
SECOND TERM IN 2020.

6
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,650
THEY ARE LIKE, SURE.

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,919
SURE HE
WILL STILL BE THERE AND RUNNING.

8
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:18,449
HE WILL BE UNOPPOSED, OF COURSE.

9
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:20,660
NOW LET'S GIVE YOU THE DETAILS.

10
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:28,779
AS YOU CAN TELL, IT ALSO
INVOLVES HIS OWN VICE PRESIDENT.

11
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:40,829
WHO ARE THE PLAYERS HERE?

12
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:48,719
SENATORS TOM COTTON AND BEEN
SASSE HAVE ALREADY BEEN TO

13
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,040
IOWA THIS YEAR.

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,920
GOVERNOR JOHN CASE AGAINST
HIRING A RETURN VISIT TO

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,280
NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND MIKE PENCE'S
SCHEDULE IS SO FULL OF POLITICAL

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,930
EVENTS THAT REPUBLICAN STROKE
THAT HE IS ACTING MORE LIKE

17
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,890
A SECOND TERM VICE PRESIDENT
HOPING TO CLEAR THE FIELD

18
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,970
THEN A NUMBER TWO SWORN IN JUST
A LITTLE OVER SIX MONTHS AGO.

19
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,530
IF YOU ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH
POLITICS, GOING TO IOWA IS

20
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,100
A TALE TELL SIGN THAT YOU ARE
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.

21
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,480
YOU DON'T RANDOMLY GO TO IOWA
WHICH IS THE FIRST STATE TO

22
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,390
HAVE A CAUCUS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.

23
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,730
DID I WIND UP IN IOWA AND NEW
HAMPSHIRE?

24
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,350
WHAT FUN TO RANDOM STATES THAT I
WENT TO AS A SENATOR.

25
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,460
NO, THAT MEANS YOU'RE RUNNING
FOR PRESIDENT THAT NOT EVERY

26
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,810
TIME, BUT MOST OF THE TIME AND
CERTAINLY, IT IS A WAY TO

27
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,240
DIP YOUR TOE IN AND TEST THE
WATER.

28
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,420
HOW MY RECEIVED IN IOWA NEW
HAMPSHIRE?

29
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,390
THEY'RE NOT RANDOMLY GOING TO
ALASKA AND NEBRASKA BECAUSE

30
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,480
THEY DON'T HAVE THE TIME FOR
US TO CONTEST IN THE

31
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,550
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.

32
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,320
IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE DO.

33
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,640
TOM COTTON, ICU, BROTHER.

34
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,880
TIMECARD WHO WAS LIKE TRUMP,
SURE, FIND OUT WHAT IS

35
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,880
GOING ON IN IOWA?

36
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,880
HAVE TO GET OVER THERE.

37
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,920
AT LEAST SASSE HAS HONESTY TO
ADMIT THAT HE IS OPPOSING

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,370
TRUMP ON MANY ISSUES AND KASICH
HAS BEEN VERY BLUNT ABOUT

39
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,460
IT SO THERE IS NO ISSUE AT
ALL.

40
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,229
KASICH RAN AGAINST HIM, DIDN'T
SUPPORT HIM, DIDN'T SUPPORT

41
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:12,900
THE PROPOSAL THAT IS A DIFFERENT
VIEW ON WHAT IT MEANS TO BE

42
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:31,830
A CONSERVATIVE, SO HE IS DOING
THIS IN PLAIN SIGHT.

43
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:36,530
SIGNPOST NUMBER TWO IS DONORS,
WHERE THE MONEY AT?

44
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,640
SHOW ME THE MONEY.

45
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,890
YOU CAN CLAIM THAT YOU ARE
RAISING FOR YOUR OWN SENATE

46
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:41,890
CANDIDACY.

47
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,390
I DONíT KNOW WHAT THE VICE
PRESIDENT WOULD BE RAISING

48
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,370
FOR THE FIRST TIME?

49
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,310
DID YOU KNOW THAT MIKE PENCE HAS
HIS OWN PAC, WE WILL GET

50
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,360
TO IT, AND IT HAS RAISED MORE
MONEY THAN TRUMPíS PAC.

51
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,300
WHY DON'T YOU MAKE IT A LITTLE
MORE OBVIOUS?

52
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,560
THERE IS NO CAMPAIGN FOR THE
VICE PRESIDENCY THAT WOULD

53
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,240
COME UP IN A REELECTION.

54
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,380
IF IT WAS THE SECOND TERM, THE
VICE PRESIDENT IS LIKELY TO

55
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,700
RUN FOR PRESIDENT, IT MAKES A
LOT OF SENSE.

56
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,600
AND THE FIRST TERM THAT IS
GOING, JUST IN CASE.

57
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,540
LINDSAY WALTER, A WHITE HOUSE
SPOKESPERSON SAYS -

58
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:23,810
BY THE WAY, THAT IS THE WHITE
HOUSE NOT DENYING THE STORY.

59
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:27,630
BUT IS SAYING THE STORY IS TRUE,
BUT THEY BETTER WATCH THEMSELVES

60
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,290
BECAUSE WE ARE STRONG IN IOWA
AND WE WILL KICK THEIR ASS.

61
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,290
INTERESTING.

62
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:36,910
JOHN MCCAIN IS ASKED ABOUT IT,
AND HE SAYS, I LOVE THIS QUOTE ñ

63
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:43,830
IN 
OTHER WORDS, THEY ARE GOING

64
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,360
TO CUT YOU IF THEY THINK

65
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,380
YOU WILL BE, ESPECIALLY
REPUBLICANS.

66
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:58,250
NOW LET'S GO TO KASICH.

67
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,250
SO CASEY, IPOD MENU.

68
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:05,069
HE IS BEING HONEST ABOUT IT.

69
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:07,560
THAT'S ALL, HE PROBABLY WILL RUN
AGAINST TRUMP.

70
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,060
HAVE AT IT.

71
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,090
THE DUPLICITOUS
ONES OF INTERESTING ONES,

72
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,540
ESPECIALLY MIKE PENCE.

73
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:25,060
THE NEW YORK TIMES CONTINUES ñ

74
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,750
TO BE FAIR IT'S IF TRUMP DOESN'T
RUN BUT THEY HAVE A LOT OF

75
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,800
PLANS.

76
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,230
YOU DON'T HAVE FAITH THAT
TRUMP IS GOING TO BE IN THE

77
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,840
OFFICE AT THE TIME OR THAT HE
IS GOING TO BE IN GOOD ENOUGH

78
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:51,330
SHAPE TO SEEK REELECTION WHICH
IS A VERY LOW BAR.

79
00:04:51,330 --> 00:05:11,570
YOU DON'T PUT TOGETHER THIS
COMMITTEE AND GET ALL THESE

80
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,650
FOLKS OF YOUR

81
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:25,650
INTERESTING IN RUNNING, BUT I
HAVE MORE.

82
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,070
WE SHOULD DO THIS IN PREVIOUS
WEEKS BECAUSE IT IS A VERY

83
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,230
SMART MOVE BY MIKE PENCE.

84
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:35,000
1, YOU GO ON TV WHICH TRUMP
WATCHES AND IN PERSON AND

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,199
SAY MISTER PRESIDENT, I BOW TO
YOU.

86
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,930
YOU ARE SO GREAT THAT ME?

87
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,760
RAISE MONEY BEHIND YOUR BACK AND
GOT IOWA AND THESE EVENTS?

88
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,699
AND OTHERS ON MY RUN?

89
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:45,830
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

90
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,669
I BOW TO YOU, MISTER PRESIDENT.

91
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:50,270
HE DOES THAT TO KEEP HIS JOB.

92
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,700
THAT MIGHT NOT BE ENTRANCE
CONTROL ANYWAY, BUT IT IS

93
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,449
MY POLITICALLY TO KEEP THE
PRESIDENT HAPPY, PLUS, MORE

94
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:59,010
IMPORTANT, HE GETS TO TURN
AROUND OR SOMETHING HAPPENS

95
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,710
TO TRUMP, HE CAN GO TO THE
TRUMP SUPPORTERS AND GO, I WAS

96
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,710
BEHIND YOUR GUY

97
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,580
THE WHOLE TIME.

98
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,270
DON'T YOU REMEMBER ME
EMBARRASSING MYSELF ON NATIONAL

99
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,270
TV?

100
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,270
MR.

101
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,490
TRUMP, YOU ARE SO
RIGHT.

102
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,979
THIS IS THE GREATEST HONOR AND
PRIVILEGE OF MY LIFE TO

103
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:17,229
EVEN BE SEATED NEXT TO YOU.

104
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:33,910
IT IS CRAFTY, BUT LET'S GET YOU
MORE DETAILS IF YOU ARE NOT

105
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:42,040
CONVINCED.

106
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,669
THIS THING IS OVER.

107
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:47,040
YOU DON'T HIRE A POLITICAL
OPERATIVE WHO HAS NEVER

108
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,720
WORKED IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
IF YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED

109
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,690
IN RUNNING A POLITICAL RACE,
LET ALONE THE FACT THAT YOU

110
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,120
MADE HIM YOUR CHIEF OF STAFF.

111
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,889
IN OTHER WORDS, THIS IS THE
ONLY THING I CARE ABOUT.

112
00:06:56,889 --> 00:06:58,840
HE'S NOT ALONE, TO BE FAIR.

113
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,840
LET'S GO TO NIKKI HALEY.

114
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:10,250
LOOK, YOU 

115
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:19,810
CAN SAY REPUBLICANS,
THEY MEET WITH DONORS

116
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:20,810
ALL THE TIME.

117
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,230
BUT AS U.N.
AMBASSADOR, WHAT DO DONORS

118
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,400
HAVE TO DO WITH YOUR JOB?

119
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,620
I DON'T KNOW.

120
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,620
OKAY, FINE.

121
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,910
BUT YOU HIRED A
POLLSTER?

122
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,389
WHAT ARE YOU POLLING, THE
OPINIONS OF ZIMBABWE ON OUR

123
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:32,389
LATEST

124
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:33,389
RESOLUTION?

125
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:35,660
THERE'S NO REASON FOR A
POLITICAL POLLSTER TO BE ON

126
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,480
THE STAFF OF A U.N. AMBASSADOR.

127
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,690
THESE PEOPLE ARE BRAZINGLY
GOING OUT THERE AND GOING OF

128
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,690
COURSE WE'RE GOING TO RUN WHEN
THIS IMPLODES.

129
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,470
TURN ON THE TV.

130
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,039
CAN'T YOU SEE IT WITH YOUR OWN
EYES?

131
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,800
THIS KIND OF INSUBORDINATION
IS FASCINATING, AND TRUMP

132
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,100
USUALLY HATES THIS STUFF, BUT
AGAIN, YOU KNOW WHY THEY DO

133
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,840
THIS SO PUBLICLY AND OPENLY?

134
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,570
BECAUSE THEY THINK HE IS TOO
STUPID TO FIGURE IT OUT.

135
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,590
UNTIL THE NEW YORK TIMES
SPELLED OUT FOR HIM, IT WAS

136
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,310
PROBABLY TRUE.

137
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,139
OF COURSE, MIKE PENCE IS GOING
TO DENY IT.

138
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:12,300
HERE'S HIS DENIAL.

139
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:18,280
WHY DO THEY ALWAYS BRING FAMILY
INTO IT?

140
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,070
NO ONE CARE WHAT YOUR WIFE IS
DOING.

141
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,260
BUT ALWAYS THESE GUYS ARE

142
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,260
LIKE,

143
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,500
I'M A GOOD CHRISTIAN.

144
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,990
MY FAMILY IS OFFENDED THAT YOU
HAVE POINTED OUT HOW MUCH

145
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,800
MONEY I'VE RAISED.

146
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,010
DID YOU RAISE THE MONEY OR
DIDN'T YOU?

147
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:37,130
FINALLY WE GO TO THAT DENIAL.

148
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:43,860
AND THEN HE WENT ON TO CALL THE
NEW YORK TIMES FAKE NEWS.

149
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,339
I KNOW, TRUMP WILL GIVE YOU A
NICE PAT ON THE HEAD FOR THAT,

150
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:49,920
BUT WHICH PART IS FAKE?

151
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,410
YOU CAN SAY, WELL, I DIDN'T
REALLY SAY THAT TO THE

152
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,970
DONORS AND MY ADVISORS DIDN'T
REALLY SAY THAT TO THE

153
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,851
DONORS, AND THAT WILL BE HARD TO
PROVE.

154
00:08:56,851 --> 00:08:59,249
IT IS A LITTLE HE SAID, SHE
SAID, BUT DID YOU GO TO THE

155
00:08:59,249 --> 00:09:00,249
DONORS?

156
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:01,249
YES.

157
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,189
DID YOU RAISE MORE MONEY THAN
TRUMP'S PAC AND DISCLOSED

158
00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:04,189
DONORS?

159
00:09:04,189 --> 00:09:06,649
YES BUT DID YOU GO TO THESE
EVENTS THAT LOOK LIKE CAMPAIGN

160
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:07,649
EVENTS?

161
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:09,110
THEY WENT TO THE PIG ROAST IN
IOWA.

162
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,130
THERE'S ONLY ONE REASON TO GO
THERE, IF YOU ARE PLANNING

163
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,250
TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT.

164
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,550
WAS IT FALSE?

165
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,550
NO.

166
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,550
NOT FALSE.

167
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,050
ALL THAT STUFF IS TOTALLY TRUE.

168
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,089
SO IF YOU THINK KNOW, TRUMP IS
FINE.

169
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:25,089
THE MEDIA IS

170
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:26,279
MAKING IT ALL UP.

171
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,389
YOU SHOULD TELL PEOPLE IN HIS
ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER

172
