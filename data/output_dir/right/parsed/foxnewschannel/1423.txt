IMPORTANT SIGNIFICANT
WEEKEND AND, OF COURSE,
BREAKING NEWS.
SIGNIFICANT BREAKING NEWS WE
HAVE TO GET TO.
IT'S THE REPORTER IN ME.
ABBY: FOX NEWS ALERT.
GRIFF, GO AHEAD.
GRIFF: KIM JONG UN AND SOUTH
KOREA'S PRESIDENT MOON
MEETING OVERNIGHT.
THE MEETING COULD STILL
HAPPEN AND STILL COULD
ACTUALLY HAPPEN IN SINGAPORE
ON JUNE 12TH.
HERE'S THE PRESIDENT.
>> WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT
HAPPENS.
WE ARE TALKING TO THEM NOW.
IT WAS A VERY NICE
STATEMENT.
SEE WHAT HAPPENS IT COULD BE
THE 12TH.
TALKING TO THEM NOW.
THEY VERY MUCH WANT TO DO
IT.
THEY WOULD LIKE TO DO IT.
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
GRIFF: WE'RE GOING TO GO
WITH THAT SOUND BITE JUST
BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE MIDST
OF CASS CAGHTD EVENTS.
SOUTH KOREA, NORTH KOREA
STOPPED TALKING TO EACH
OTHER.
THEN NORTH KOREA DIDN'T SHOW
UP FOR THE PLANNING MEETING
FOR THAT SUMMIT.
THE PRESIDENT SENT THAT
LETTER, PULLS OUT.
OF THE DMZ IN NORTH
CAROLINA.
PETE: NORTH KOREA YOU MEAN.
ABBY: LITTLE DIFFERENT
PLACE.
PETE: HAVE YOU BARBECUE ON
THE MIND.
GRIFF: WE ARE TOLD INITIAL
REPORT THEY DID DISCUSS THE
SUMMIT STILL TAKING PLACE.
WE HAVE PHOTOS COMING INTO
OUR NEWSROOM.
FIRST TIME THE LEADERS HAVE
MET YOU SAID, GRIFF, SINCE
THE PRESIDENT PULLED OUT OF
THAT MEETING.
YOU WILL REMEMBER THIS ALL
STARTED BACK IN A THE FIRST
TIME THESE TWO LEADERS MET.
MET ON THE DMZ.
SOUTH KOREAN SOIL.
FOOT ON SOUTH KOREAN SOIL.
THE MEETING HAPPENED AS
WE'RE TOLD STILL ON THE DMZ
BUT ON THE NORTH KOREAN
SIDE.
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS SAID
IN THIS MEETING BETWEEN THE
TWO LEADERS.
WHAT I WILL SAY IS PRESIDENT
OF SOUTH KOREA TALKS ALL THE
TIME WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.
THEY ARE IN -- THEY KNOW
EXACTLY WHERE THEY WANT TO
GO WITH THE SUMMIT.
THEY WANT TO COMMUNICATE
TOGETHER ON THIS.
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO
MAKE SURE THEY ARE ON THE
SAME PAGE TALKING WITH KIM
JONG UN.
THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE SAME
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT
MEANS TO DENUCLEARIZE.
PETE: PLAY GOOD COP, BAD
COP.
THAT MEETING WITH PRESIDENT
TRUMP.
THIS IS A REITERATION OF
THAT OKAY, WE'LL COME BACK
TO THE TABLE.
JUST KIDDING ALL THAT BAD
STUFF WE SAID ABOUT JOHN
BOLTON.
WE WILL TAKE THAT BACK.
ULTIMATELY PRESIDENT TRUMP
IS SETTING THE TERMS OF THIS
DISCUSSION BECAUSE THE END
STATE IS A DIFFICULT ONE
WHICH IS GETTING A BRUTAL,
TERRIBLE DICTATOR TO
ACTUALLY GIVEN HIS NUKES.
GRIFF: WHICH WOULD BE VERY
DIFFICULT THIS ALL STARTS IN
1994 WITH BILL CLINTON AND
ESSENTIALLY APPEASED NORTH
KOREA.
THEY HAVE TRIED TO SAY THEY
ARE GOING TO BACK AWAY.
NOW, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
THE MOST HISTORIC MEETING
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES, THE LEADER OF
NORTH KOREA.
AND ACTUALLY BRINGING PEACE
ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA.
HERE'S THE THING.
THE LETTER.
THE LETTER WAS FIRST TIME WE
HAVE HAD DIRECT CONTACT
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES AND THE
DICTATOR OF NORTH KOREA.
AND CLEARLY THAT HAD SOME
IMPACT HERE BECAUSE YOU HAVE
GOT KIM JONG UN AND
PRESIDENT MOON MEETING.
ABBY: THAT DIRECT CONTACT IS
SO IMPORTANT.
UP UNTIL THIS POINT, THEY
HAVE ONLY BEEN COMMUNICATING
VIA OUR MEDIA OUTLETS.
YOU MENTIONED JOHN BOLTON,
PETE.
THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT
THAT WE COMMUNICATE EXACTLY
AND VISA VERSA.
WHETHER YOU HAVE FOLKS LIKE
JOHN BOLTON AND MIKE PENCE
TALKING ABOUT THE LIBYA
OPERATION THAT CAN GET NEWS
TROUBLE.
THE WAY THE NORTH KOREANS
SEE IT THE QADDAFI WAS
KILLED IN THAT OPERATION.
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT HOW WE
WANT THIS TO END.
NOW, PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN
YOU LISTEN TO HIS TONE, HE
WANTS THE SUMMIT TO HAPPEN.
HE WANTS TO MAKE THIS WORK.
NOW IS HE TALKING TO THE
PRESIDENT OF SOUTH KOREA
SAYING COMMUNICATE WITH HIM,
EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE ON THIS
AND LET'S SEE HOW WE CAN
MOVE FORWARD, WHERE WE CAN
GO FROM HERE.
PETE: WHEN YOU READ THAT
LETTER, IT WAS CLEAR IT WAS
DICTATED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP.
TRUMPIAN FORM WITH THE BLUNT
STATEMENT OF WE GOT MASSIVE
NUKES AND WE DON'T WANT TO
HAVE TO USE THEM IF WE NEED
TO.
ABBY: WE'LL.
PETE: CALL US.
IT'S INSIDE THE PSYCHOLOGY
OF KIM JONG UN WE WILL
ATTACK THEM AND BOMB NORTH
KOREA TO PREVENT THAT IF HE
DOES, HE WILL COME TO THE
TABLE AND SAY ALL RIGHT,
LET'S FIGURE THIS OUT.
GRIFF: THAT IS THE KEY,
GETTING TO THE TABLE.
DEMOCRATS, YOU SAW NANCY
PELOSI AND OTHERS HAVE
CRITICIZED THE PRESIDENT FOR
BASICALLY GIVING KIM JONG UN
WHAT HE WANTS.
HE WANTS INTERNATIONAL
STATUS.
HE WANTS TO BE SEEN AND HE
IS HAVING ESSENTIALLY GIVE
UP NOTHING OTHER THAN
SHUTTING THAT NUCLEAR SITE
DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF
ACTUALLY DID DO ANYTHING.
THE FACT THAT THIS LETTER
AND THESE EVENTS, THE WAY
THE PRESIDENT AND THIS WHITE
HOUSE IS STRATEGICALLY
PLAYED IT HAS GOTTEN THEM TO
THE TABLE CALLED OFF BY OUT
PRESIDENT.
HEAR A LOT MORE ABOUT THIS
STORY THIS WEEKEND.
THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT THAT
IS VERY SIGNIFICANT.
>> YOU TALK ABOUT ALL THE
PIECES THAT ARE INVOLVED AND
DELICATE BALANCE.
WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT
CHINA.
CHINA CONTINUES TO BE
PROBABLY THE BIGGEST PART OF
THIS WHOLE DEAL PART OF THIS
CONVERSATION.
THEY KEEP NORTH KOREA
AFLOAT.
CHINA IS A BIG DEAL HERE.
BECAUSE OF CHINA ULTIMATELY
THAT CAUSED KIM JONG UN TO
BACK OFF OR SAY SOME OF THE
THINGS THAT HE SAID THAT
MADE PRESIDENT TRUMP WALK
AWAY FROM THIS THING.
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO
SEE HOW CHINA RESPONDS
THOUGH.
NORTH KOREA BEFORE THIS
ULTIMATE A LOT OF
PERSONALITIES, PETE.
PETE: SINGING A DIFFERENT
TUNE.
ABBY: REMEMBER THAT?
HE TOOK THAT TRAIN RIDE.
PETE: LOOK AT THAT EMBRACE
RIGHT THERE.
TWO PEOPLE-TWO I PEOPLE WHO
HAVE BEEN POINTING GUNS AT
EACH OTHER FOR 70 YEARS FOR
A WAR THAT NEVER ENDED.
A LOT OF FAMILIES SEPARATED
BY THAT DNC THAT WOULD
BY DHAT DNC THAT WOULD
BY DMZT DNC THAT WOULD
BY DMZ. DNC THAT WOULD
REPRESENTS A LOT OF HISTORY
THAT PHOTO RIGHT THERE.
ABBY: EVERYONE OUT THERE WHO
SAYS THIS THING HAS FAILED.
THIS FAILURE ON THE
PRESIDENT'S PART, LET'S BE
VERY CAREFUL.
POTENTIALLY CREATING A LOT
MORE PEACE ON THE WORLD
STAGE AND YOU SEE THESE
LEADERS THERE THIS IS
BREAKING NEWS OVERNIGHT.
THESE THINGS TAKE TIME.
A LOT GETS PUT INTO AN
ULTIMATE SUMMIT IF IT COMES
TO THAT.
A LOT OF IT TAKES PATIENCE
LEAD DIPLOMACY DO WHAT
DIPLOMACY DOES.
