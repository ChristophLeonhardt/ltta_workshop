1
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,050
I consider myself an artist, and
I’m inspired by other artists.

2
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,880
By people who make stuff.

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,610
One of my greatest
inspirations is my grandfather

4
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,030
who was an artist throughout
his life and made stuff until,

5
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,390
like, literally the last week
he spent on planet Earth.

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,620
You know, at 94 years old,
he was still painting.

7
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,986
Gramps left over 100
sketchbooks and 2,500 paintings.

8
00:00:32,986 --> 00:00:35,860
And in talking with my dad who’s
been trying to sift through it all

9
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,560
I didn’t realize just how much
stuff I hadn’t seen before.

10
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,840
“Do you have the — 
his story of his life?

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,691
Have you seen that?”

12
00:00:43,691 --> 00:00:44,190
No.

13
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:44,900
No.

14
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,870
“It’s Gramps’s memory book.
Did I give that to you?”

15
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,360
So apparently, Gramps kept
a log of random memories

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,320
in a sketchbook.

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,030
Hundreds of pages of
writing and illustrations.

18
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,300
He’ll have a memory
about a geography test

19
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,070
he took in seventh
grade, butted up

20
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,810
against a memory of
surviving a plane crash,

21
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,990
which 15 pages
later he’ll revisit

22
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,270
to describe in more detail.

23
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,430
He talks about seeing
the original “Frankenstein”

24
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,810
with his father in 1931 and his
experiences in World War II,

25
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,240
but throughout there are
accounts of the stuff

26
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,770
he was making.

27
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,490
This is a really small drawing,
but it grabbed my attention.

28
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,650
Apparently, he bought
this Chevy for 50 bucks

29
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,690
and it didn’t come with windows.

30
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:28,690
And so instead, as a joke,
he fashioned his own.

31
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,960
“It was the time of
the Chicago gangsters

32
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,340
and in the empty
window slots,

33
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,420
I made cardboard 
cut-outs of mobsters.”

34
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,180
Wait, empty window slots?

35
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,410
So it was just open?

36
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:38,910
“Yeah.”

37
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,100
No glass?

38
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,980
“Yeah, but you could roll,
but nothing would roll up.

39
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,020
So he made these things
that would be underneath,

40
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,170
but you’d roll them up,
and that’s what you’d see.”

41
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,500
[Laughter] No way!

42
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,310
My grandfather was a man who
got a crazy idea in his head

43
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,710
and just ran with it.

44
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,750
And this is something
I want to be more like.

45
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,520
When I was going
through the memory book,

46
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,500
I came across a couple
of memories of Gramps

47
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,960
creating something that
actually involved my dad,

48
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,750
and I wanted to see
whether or not he

49
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,460
remembered these same events.

50
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,970
“He always talked about when
he was little at the dentist,

51
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,070
he was looking at
a magazine that

52
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,100
had a bicycle with wings on it.

53
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,170
And I think the
front of the bicycle,

54
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,880
the wheel was up in the air.

55
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,850
I don’t know what, but it
sparked his imagination

56
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,610
and he had mentioned
a few times.

57
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,330
Anyway, he built
these things and they

58
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,700
were cardboard two or three
ply that he had taped together,

59
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,400
and then he put some
little propellers

60
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,820
from his model airplanes.

61
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,530
We went to Audubon
Park to ride it.

62
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,100
But I guess, you know, I
knew I wasn’t going to fly,

63
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,120
but I sort of had the impression

64
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,500
that the front wheel
would come up.

65
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,875
You know, I just
thought it would

66
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:52,700
be an experience other than just
riding around with these wings on.

67
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,800
And of course, nothing happened
and I was really disappointed.”

68
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,930
There were so many
pages of memories.

69
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,550
So many stories I hadn’t heard.

70
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,770
And I find myself
reflecting on this moment

71
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,730
on the phone talking to my
dad about his dad,

72
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,840
connected by something that was
made specifically for us.

73
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,260
“Yeah. Well, the thing that was really
neat in his last few years,

74
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,880
he would just pull
these off the shelf

75
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,860
and, like,
live his life again.

76
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,494
And then he’d stop
when he saw an image,

77
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,300
and he would paint it.
You know?”

78
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,282
[MUSIC PLAYING]

79
00:03:30,702 --> 00:03:32,090
“Look on page 42 …”

80
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,630
Wow, yeah … I see it.

81
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,186
How old is he at that point?

82
00:03:35,186 --> 00:03:36,912
“… look at this one. 
This is good. Page 38 …”

83
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:37,698
So incredible.

84
00:03:37,698 --> 00:03:40,120
“36. Page 36 …
Oh, that’s 1914 … ”

85
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,940
[Laughter]

86
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,940
The stuff my
grandfather made seemed

87
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,160
to help him interpret
and chronicle

88
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,390
the journey of his life.

89
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,170
I’d like to make
stuff like that too,

90
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,850
and this seems like a
decent place to start.

91
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,420
Thanks, Dad.

92
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:01,960
“O.K.”

93
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,840
Have a good weekend.

94
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,890
“O.K. Same to you.”

95
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,810
All right. See you.

96
00:04:04,810 --> 00:00:00,000
“Bye bye.”
