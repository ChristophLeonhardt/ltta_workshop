1
00:00:00,872 --> 00:00:01,490
[boink]

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:04,340
Donald Trump thinks he’s
making America great again

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,030
like this.

4
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:05,830
[honking]

5
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:07,167
A little bit of this.

6
00:00:07,167 --> 00:00:07,750
“Our nation — "

7
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:08,792
“Honey, I’m calling ICE."

8
00:00:08,792 --> 00:00:09,291
Ugh.

9
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:09,927
And this.

10
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:11,300
[applause]

11
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,490
It’s a throwback to
another era, when things

12
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,530
were black and mostly white.

13
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,645
Not really our idea of great.

14
00:00:17,645 --> 00:00:20,510
“Make America great again."

15
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,510
But Trump has achieved
something significant,

16
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:24,950
and he deserves credit.

17
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,420
But it’s the same
kind of credit

18
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,150
Inspector Gadget deserves
for unintentionally

19
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,552
solving a crime.

20
00:00:30,552 --> 00:00:31,848
[groans]

21
00:00:31,848 --> 00:00:33,600
All right, hear me out.

22
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,990
During Obama’s eight years
of competent, scandal-free

23
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,400
leadership, democracy was
very much a spectator sport.

24
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,490
In the 2014 midterm
elections, Democrats

25
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,560
had so much
confidence in Obama,

26
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,710
they didn’t even bother
to show up at the polls,

27
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,655
turning out the lowest
number of voters in 70 years.

28
00:00:53,655 --> 00:00:55,350
“A goddamn disaster
for Democrats.

29
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,870
They got destroyed."

30
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,820
Which just so happened to
give Republicans the edge

31
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,880
to block Obama’s Supreme
Court pick, Merrick Garland,

32
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,349
in 2016.

33
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:07,740
And now, Trump is forcing us
to engage in our democracy

34
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,880
like many never have before.

35
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,830
For instance, contrast their
very different reactions

36
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,400
to the most mind boggling,
only-in-America dilemma —

37
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,120
mass shootings.

38
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:25,754
"(SINGING) Amazing grace ..."

39
00:01:25,754 --> 00:01:26,705
[applause]

40
00:01:26,705 --> 00:01:29,720
I mean, he breaks into a
pitch-perfect rendition

41
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,950
of "Amazing Grace."

42
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,930
You can’t get
better than that.

43
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,820
He insisted
Congress take action

44
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,000
and ban assault-style weapons
and high-capacity magazines.

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,840
He even signed 23
executive actions.

46
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,270
And then, nothing changed.

47
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,060
Not a single law
or reform was made

48
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,950
to address our gun crisis.

49
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,100
Was our faith in Obama so
profound that we forgot

50
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,080
to do something ourselves?

51
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,715
Enter 45.

52
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:58,910
“To help secure our
schools and tackle

53
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,225
the difficult issue
of mental health ... "

54
00:02:02,225 --> 00:02:05,540
Trump, with his total lack of
actual solutions on our gun

55
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,550
crisis, inspired this.

56
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,960
[cheering]

57
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,758
After years of
nothing, Florida

58
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:13,880
raised the legal age for
buying a firearm from 18

59
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,400
to 21 and banned bump stocks.

60
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,650
Stock prices soared
for sports stores

61
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,930
that stopped selling
assault-style rifles.

62
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,600
Even several gun owners
destroyed their own weapons

63
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,950
for the cause.

64
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,570
Where was this
urgency after Orlando?

65
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,670
San Bernardino?

66
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,300
Aurora?

67
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,080
Charleston?

68
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,640
Sandy Hook?

69
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,080
All right, now,
before you start

70
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,110
ranting about normalization,
let me be clear.

71
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,690
I have no delusions about
the destructive force

72
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,140
of a narcissist for president,
for reproductive rights,

73
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:47,090
for public schools, for
immigrants, for the planet.

74
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,990
However, something important
and desperately needed

75
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,490
is also happening.

76
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,740
Americans are taking a stand.

77
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,600
And it’s much more than guns.

78
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,980
Witnessing a self-admitted
sexual assaulter

79
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,820
win the presidency
pushed us over the edge

80
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,797
to finally tackle decades
of silence around sexism.

81
00:03:04,797 --> 00:03:06,780
“Allegations by
numerous women who

82
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,300
say the Hollywood mogul — "

83
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,415
“Harvey Weinstein
in handcuffs."

84
00:03:10,415 --> 00:03:13,295
“CBS News has suspended
our co-host Charlie Rose — "

85
00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:16,730
And the sea change goes
beyond calling out gross men.

86
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,280
More women than ever
are entering politics —

87
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,640
nearly 600 in total for 2018.

88
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,490
And we’ve already seen
some early primary wins.

89
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,490
Oh, and way more people are
supporting organizations

90
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,830
that are vital to our
democracy, like the more

91
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,800
than $86 million donated to the A.C.L.U.

92
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,500
in 2017, up from
the $5 million

93
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,560
they received in online
donations in 2016.

94
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,780
Planned Parenthood
donations skyrocketed,

95
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,390
reaching 40 times their
normal rate in the week

96
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,560
after the election.

97
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,720
Even local politics
hold our attention

98
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,440
and make national news.

99
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,470
It’s the new norm to
track court rulings

100
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,580
and be informed.

101
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,010
People are actually reading
and paying for news.

102
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,350
So here’s the deal.

103
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,390
The Democrats appear
to be more fired up

104
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,730
about the midterms than
Republicans, according

105
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,420
to this Pew Research study.

106
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,870
But we all know what
happens when eggs are

107
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,445
counted before they hatch.

108
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:10,620
“The largest audience to
ever witness an inauguration,

109
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,780
period."

110
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,820
So don’t go back to sleep.

111
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,640
Don’t let this deluge
of news and chaos turn

112
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,170
into white noise.

113
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,790
Stay in the game.

114
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:23,120
And definitely, please,
vote in the midterms

115
00:04:23,120 --> 00:00:00,000
this November.
