00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:11,392
>> Jesse: EVIL TRUMP STRIKES

2
00:00:11,392 --> 00:00:13,427
AGAIN, SHOCKING IN IMAGES OF

3
00:00:13,427 --> 00:00:15,563
IMMIGRANT CHILDREN SPEAKING IN

4
00:00:15,563 --> 00:00:19,300
CAGES ON THE FLOOR.

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,502
NOT SO FAST EVERYONE, TURNS OUT

6
00:00:21,502 --> 00:00:23,170
THESE PICTURES WERE FOUR YEARS

7
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:23,604
OLD.

8
00:00:23,604 --> 00:00:26,107
THAT WAS WHEN THEIR HERO, OBAMA

9
00:00:26,107 --> 00:00:27,174
WAS IN CHARGE.

10
00:00:27,174 --> 00:00:29,977
AND WITH THAT, THE LOUD

11
00:00:29,977 --> 00:00:30,978
CONDEMNATIONS GO SILENT.

12
00:00:30,978 --> 00:00:33,014
BUT WHO CARES NOW, THEIR IDOL

13
00:00:33,014 --> 00:00:34,916
WAS BOSS AT THE TIME.

14
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:38,286
THIS PHOTO OF AN ALL BABY SEAT

15
00:00:38,286 --> 00:00:41,255
IMMIGRATION DETENTION BUS WAS

16
00:00:41,255 --> 00:00:43,591
ALSO CALLED A PRISON BUS JUST

17
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:43,991
FOR BABIES.

18
00:00:43,991 --> 00:00:46,594
BUT THE PHOTO WAS ALSO FROM

19
00:00:46,594 --> 00:00:48,863
OBAMA’S ERA AND IT’S A BUS FOR

20
00:00:48,863 --> 00:00:49,263
FIELD TRIPS.

21
00:00:49,263 --> 00:00:51,399
AND DID YOU HEAR THE WIDELY

22
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:52,600
SHARED CLAIM ABOUT 1500

23
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,601
IMMIGRANT KIDS THAT WERE

24
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:56,404
SEPARATED FROM MOM AND DAD AGAIN

25
00:00:56,404 --> 00:00:58,006
BY EVIL TRUMP?

26
00:00:58,006 --> 00:00:59,240
THESE CHILDREN ACTUALLY ARRIVED

27
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,209
ALONE MINUS THEIR PARENTS AND

28
00:01:01,209 --> 00:01:03,044
THEN WERE PLACED AMONG SPONSORS.

29
00:01:03,044 --> 00:01:04,479
THE GOVERNMENT HAD LOST TRACK OF

30
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,281
THEM WHICH SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT

31
00:01:06,281 --> 00:01:08,083
THE SYSTEM, THE SYSTEM THAT

32
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:10,352
TRUMP WANTS TO FIX.

33
00:01:10,352 --> 00:01:12,220
AND SO AS TRUMP CEMENTS HIS

34
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:12,988
AGENDA THROUGH SIGNIFICANT

35
00:01:12,988 --> 00:01:13,855
LEGISLATION, THESE FOLKS HAVE

36
00:01:13,855 --> 00:01:17,592
THE VAPORS OVER IMAGINARY

37
00:01:17,592 --> 00:01:18,059
DISCRIMINATION.

38
00:01:18,059 --> 00:01:21,763
BUT IF YOU CAN’T BLAME HIM FOR

39
00:01:21,763 --> 00:01:22,798
THAT, WHAT’S NEXT?

40
00:01:22,798 --> 00:01:23,799
THE MEDIA CAN’T EVEN CHECK THE

41
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:25,801
DATE ON THE PHOTO AND THAT’S

42
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:28,904
THEIR JOB TO CHECK FACTS.

43
00:01:28,904 --> 00:01:33,709
ALL THE USUAL SUSPECTS, IDENTITY

44
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:37,412
ADVOCATES, AND IT’S NO LONGER A

45
00:01:37,412 --> 00:01:40,015
CATCHPHRASE, IT’S A BRAND.

46
00:01:40,015 --> 00:01:41,784
I HAVE AN IDEA.

47
00:01:41,784 --> 00:01:42,518
DANA, WHERE IS IT?

48
00:01:42,518 --> 00:01:47,456
I LOST IT.

49
00:01:47,456 --> 00:01:48,023
HERE IT IS.

50
00:01:48,023 --> 00:01:49,725
TRUMP SHOULD GO ON NATIONAL TV

51
00:01:49,725 --> 00:01:53,195
AND LAYOUT POINT BY POINT HIS

52
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:54,163
PLAN TO EMBARRASS THE DEMOCRATS

53
00:01:54,163 --> 00:01:56,599
WITH THE FACT THAT HE IS

54
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,800
ACTUALLY OFFERING A PLAN FOR

55
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,101
CITIZENSHIP THAT THEY DON’T.

56
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:01,070
BUT DON’T DO IT ON TWEETS, GO

57
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,271
OUT AND DO IT.

58
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:05,574
THAT’S A GOOD IDEA.

59
00:02:05,574 --> 00:02:08,777
>> Dana: I THINK YOU COULD DO

60
00:02:08,777 --> 00:02:10,378
MORE POLICY ORIENTED SPEECHES.

61
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:12,214
JUST DO THAT AND NOTHING ELSE.

62
00:02:12,214 --> 00:02:13,783
HE COULD DO AN OVAL OFFICE OF

63
00:02:13,783 --> 00:02:15,218
THE ADDRESS WHICH WOULD BE ONE

64
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,053
WAY TO DO IT WHICH REALLY

65
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,588
FOCUSES THE MIND AND MEANS THAT

66
00:02:18,588 --> 00:02:19,956
WOULD BE A PRIMETIME ADDRESS.

67
00:02:19,956 --> 00:02:23,826
IF THIS WAS A NUMBER ONE ISSUE,

68
00:02:23,826 --> 00:02:25,261
CERTAINLY FOR REPUBLICANS BUT

69
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:27,063
ALSO AN ECONOMIC ISSUE, THEY

70
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,265
HAVE ALL THE DEMOCRATS IN THE

71
00:02:29,265 --> 00:02:29,999
HOUSE AND A LOT OF HOUSE

72
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:31,868
REPUBLICANS SIGNING THIS

73
00:02:31,868 --> 00:02:32,602
DISCHARGE POSITION TO ACTUALLY

74
00:02:32,602 --> 00:02:36,072
FORCE VOTES ON THE DACA ISSUE,

75
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,173
SO THE PRESIDENT WOULD BE RIGHT

76
00:02:37,173 --> 00:02:38,842
TO GET OUT IN FRONT OF IT.

77
00:02:38,842 --> 00:02:41,044
IN THE MEANTIME, THE OTHER THING

78
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:42,812
THAT YOU SHOULD DO IS SAY, I’M

79
00:02:42,812 --> 00:02:44,347
NOT GOING TO WAIT FOR CONGRESS

80
00:02:44,347 --> 00:02:45,615
TO FIX THIS ISSUE.

81
00:02:45,615 --> 00:02:47,017
WHATEVER HE CAN DO TO FIX THE

82
00:02:47,017 --> 00:02:49,419
SYSTEM AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS

83
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,420
WITHIN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,

84
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,688
ABOUT KEEPING TRACK OF THESE

85
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:55,158
CHILDREN, HE COULD LAY THAT OUT,

86
00:02:55,158 --> 00:02:57,627
TOO.

87
00:02:57,627 --> 00:02:59,663
I DON’T KNOW IF YOU SAW THIS

88
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:00,530
OVER THE WEEKEND BECAUSE YOU ON

89
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,200
LIKE ME HAVE A LIFE, BUT

90
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,271
IVANKA TRUMP TWEETED A PHOTO OF

91
00:03:07,404 --> 00:03:09,406
SHE HAD A PICTURE OF HER SON

92
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:11,041
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS

93
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,744
LIKE, WHILE DISMISSING CHILD

94
00:03:13,744 --> 00:03:16,046
NARRATIVE GOING ON.

95
00:03:16,046 --> 00:03:18,382
>> I DIDN’T REALLY LOOK AT    AE

96
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:20,417
BLACKBERRY A LOT, OR iPHONE

97
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:21,985
THIS WEEKEND.

98
00:03:21,985 --> 00:03:23,620
I TRIED TO UNPLUG.

99
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,255
EVERY TIME I DID DIVE IN AND

100
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:27,658
CHECK IT OUT, THE MEDIA WAS

101
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:28,058
SCREWING UP.

102
00:03:28,058 --> 00:03:32,329
EVERY SINGLE TIME, WHETHER IT

103
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:35,166
WAS IVANKA OR THIS.

104
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,067
AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS

105
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:38,035
STORY ABOUT THE PHOTOS AND HE

106
00:03:38,035 --> 00:03:40,271
HAD A GREAT LINE AND HE SAID,

107
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:41,672
THE DEMOCRATS KEEP GETTING HIT

108
00:03:41,672 --> 00:03:43,607
SQUARE BETWEEN THE EYES AND THEY

109
00:03:43,607 --> 00:03:45,009
DON’T EVEN REALIZE IT.

110
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:46,944
THINK ABOUT THIS, YOU HAVE THE

111
00:03:46,944 --> 00:03:48,846
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION, YOU HAVE

112
00:03:48,846 --> 00:03:51,282
THE KNEELING, OPPOSING THE TAX

113
00:03:51,282 --> 00:03:51,582
CUTS.

114
00:03:51,582 --> 00:03:53,584
EVERYTHING KEEPS BACKFIRING ON

115
00:03:53,584 --> 00:03:54,418
THE DEMOCRATS.

116
00:03:54,418 --> 00:03:57,588
THE SAD THING IS, THIS PHOTO

117
00:03:57,588 --> 00:03:59,390
GOES OUT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

118
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,025
TIMES AND THEN THE RETRACTION

119
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:02,493
AND THE DELETION DOESN’T GET

120
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:03,428
SEEN.

121
00:04:03,428 --> 00:04:04,996
THE REASON THEY DO THIS, THE

122
00:04:04,996 --> 00:04:07,198
REASON THEY HAVE THE POLICY TO

123
00:04:07,198 --> 00:04:08,933
SEPARATE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES

124
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:10,234
IS TO DISCOURAGE HUMAN

125
00:04:10,234 --> 00:04:13,404
TRAFFICKING, TO DISCOURAGE

126
00:04:13,404 --> 00:04:15,373
FAMILIES FROM TAKING KIDS ACROSS

127
00:04:15,373 --> 00:04:17,608
THE TREACHEROUS, HOT, DANGEROUS

128
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:20,011
SOUTHERN BORDER TRIP, AND THEY

129
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:21,413
WANT TO DISCOURAGE DANGEROUS AND

130
00:04:21,413 --> 00:04:23,448
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.

131
00:04:23,448 --> 00:04:26,017
SO IF THEY WANT TO CHANGE THE

132
00:04:26,017 --> 00:04:28,820
POLICY, LET’S GET A DEAL ON

133
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,622
DACA, A DEAL ON MIRROR

134
00:04:30,622 --> 00:04:31,222
MERIT-BASED.

135
00:04:31,222 --> 00:04:35,026
IF YOU ARE JUST GOING TO DO A

136
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:35,627
POTSHOT, YOU’RE GOING TO

137
00:04:35,627 --> 00:04:37,796
EMBARRASS THEM.

138
00:04:37,796 --> 00:04:40,198
SO SOME WOULD SAY IT’S A MORE

139
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:41,099
HUMANE POLICY TO DO THAT.

140
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:46,104
THAT’S THE ARGUMENT.

141
00:04:46,104 --> 00:04:48,273
AND THAT IS WHERE YOU PLACE THEM

142
00:04:48,273 --> 00:04:48,974
WITH SPONSORS LIKE YOU WOULD

143
00:04:48,974 --> 00:04:50,809
FOSTER CARE.

144
00:04:50,809 --> 00:04:53,011
>> ONE OF THE PROBLEMS HERE

145
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:54,780
THAT’S BEEN GOING ON FOR TWO

146
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:01,086
YEARS, THERE’S SO MUCH EMOTIONAL

147
00:05:01,086 --> 00:05:01,887
BAGGAGE, THEIR CONFIRMATION BIAS

148
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:02,788
FORCES THEM TO SEE EVERYTHING.

149
00:05:02,788 --> 00:05:04,656
IT’S GOT TO BE HIS FAULT, IT’S

150
00:05:04,656 --> 00:05:07,393
GOT TO BE HIS FAULT.

151
00:05:07,393 --> 00:05:09,495
THEY HAVEN’T YET BEEN ABLE TO

152
00:05:09,495 --> 00:05:09,895
SHAKE THAT.

153
00:05:09,895 --> 00:05:12,398
>> I THINK YOU COULD SAY THE

154
00:05:12,398 --> 00:05:14,633
SAME ABOUT BARACK OBAMA OR

155
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:19,305
HILLARY CLINTON.

156
00:05:19,305 --> 00:05:20,840
BUT NEVER FROM YOU, JESSIE.

157
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,411
BECAUSE I DON’T LISTEN TO

158
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:26,011
LIMBAUGH.

159
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:27,213
BUT IT’S INCREDIBLY EMOTIONAL

160
00:05:27,213 --> 00:05:29,015
BECAUSE THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE’S

161
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:30,650
LIVES AND AS JESSE JUST

162
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,818
MENTIONED, THEY ARE VERY

163
00:05:32,818 --> 00:05:33,819
DANGEROUS CONDITIONS.

164
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:34,687
WHEN YOU HAVE UNACCOMPANIED

165
00:05:34,687 --> 00:05:37,523
MINOR SHOWING UP OF THE BORDER,

166
00:05:37,523 --> 00:05:39,091
IT’S A HEARTBREAKING SITUATION.

167
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:39,759
BOTH SIDES TOOK ON TO SUCH

168
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,964
EXTREMES NOW THAT THE SPACE FOR

169
00:05:44,964 --> 00:05:47,066
A DEAL IS INCREASING IS

170
00:05:47,066 --> 00:05:48,568
INCORRECT INCREASINGLY

171
00:05:48,568 --> 00:05:48,935
SHRINKING.

172
00:05:48,935 --> 00:05:50,970
IF THE PRESIDENT WENT OUT AND

173
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:51,571
GAVE AN ADDRESS THAT WAS

174
00:05:51,571 --> 00:05:53,806
SOMEWHERE DOWN THE MIDDLE AND

175
00:05:53,806 --> 00:05:55,508
TRY TO THINK BOTH SIDES

176
00:05:55,508 --> 00:05:56,876
TOGETHER, I DEPENDING ON WHAT IT

177
00:05:56,876 --> 00:05:58,311
SAID WOULD THINK THAT WAS

178
00:05:58,311 --> 00:06:00,413
PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA.

179
00:06:00,413 --> 00:06:02,015
THE CHALLENGE IS, THE REPUBLICAN

180
00:06:02,015 --> 00:06:04,017
CONGRESS ISN’T ON THE SAME PAGE

181
00:06:04,017 --> 00:06:06,453
PARTICULARLY IN THE HOUSE, IN A

182
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:06,886
MIDTERM HERE.

183
00:06:06,886 --> 00:06:09,022
NOW WE ARE IN THE SITUATION

184
00:06:09,022 --> 00:06:10,056
WHERE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

185
00:06:10,056 --> 00:06:11,157
HAS SEPARATED 800 CHILDREN FROM

186
00:06:11,157 --> 00:06:15,395
THEIR PARENTS SINCE OCTOBER,

187
00:06:15,395 --> 00:06:17,197
OFTEN FOR GOOD REASONS AND

188
00:06:17,197 --> 00:06:19,833
SOMETIMES NOT.

189
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:20,700
THIS IS HEARTBREAKING, AND NO

190
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,604
ONE IN THIS POLITICAL CLIMATE IT

191
00:06:24,604 --> 00:06:25,338
SEEMS LIKE IT’S ACTUALLY TRYING

192
00:06:25,338 --> 00:06:27,808
TO FIX IT.

193
00:06:27,808 --> 00:06:30,410
>> YOU SHOULD BE A SPONSOR.

194
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:35,249
I VOLUNTEER YOU.

195
00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:36,450
WHEN PEOPLE ARE EXPOSED AS

196
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,851
WRONG, THEY NEVER ADMIT IT.

197
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:39,820
THEY JUST REMOVE THEIR TWEETS

198
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,221
AND RUN AWAY.

199
00:06:41,221 --> 00:06:42,623
AND THAT DRIVES ME NUTS.

200
00:06:42,623 --> 00:06:44,792
>> YES.

201
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:47,027
BUT THAT IS TRUE, YOU SEE THE

202
00:06:47,027 --> 00:06:47,728
MAINSTREAM MEDIA MAKING THESE

203
00:06:47,728 --> 00:06:51,298
MISTAKES AND THEY CHASE AFTER

204
00:06:51,298 --> 00:06:52,199
THE ACCOUNTS AND THEY PUT UP

205
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,101
FALSE STORIES.

206
00:06:54,235 --> 00:06:57,838
PHOTOGRAPH SAYS FROM 2,014.

207
00:06:57,838 --> 00:07:00,341
EVERYONE SHOULD CARE, WHATEVER

208
00:07:00,341 --> 00:07:01,242
YOUR POLITICS OR ADMINISTRATION

209
00:07:01,242 --> 00:07:03,144
YOU ARE IN, ABOUT CHILDREN.

210
00:07:03,144 --> 00:07:04,412
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ACTUAL

211
00:07:04,412 --> 00:07:08,015
FACTS OF THE LAWS,

212
00:07:08,015 --> 00:07:08,549
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS

213
00:07:08,549 --> 00:07:09,317
DEMONSTRATIONS FOLLOWING THE LAW

214
00:07:09,317 --> 00:07:10,718
ON THE BOOK IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU

215
00:07:10,718 --> 00:07:12,853
DO WHEN PEOPLE ENTER THE COUNTRY

216
00:07:12,853 --> 00:07:14,055
ILLEGALLY WITH CHILDREN.

217
00:07:14,055 --> 00:07:15,122
THE GOAL AND AIM BEHIND IT IS TO

218
00:07:15,122 --> 00:07:17,625
BE PROTECTIVE OF CHILDREN SO IT

219
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:18,960
DOESN’T FOSTER THIS WHOLE LEGAL

220
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:25,600
OF HUMAN TRACK THEY CAME.

221
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,200
DON’T ENTER THE COUNTRY

222
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,070
ILLEGALLY AND DON’T PUT YOUR

223
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:45,153
CHILDREN AT RISK.

224
00:07:45,153 --> 00:07:45,854
OTHER PEOPLE ARE FOLLOWING IT

225
00:07:45,854 --> 00:07:46,488
AND TRYING TO GET INTO THE

226
00:07:46,488 --> 00:07:46,955
COUNTRY LEGALLY.

227
00:07:46,955 --> 00:07:47,689
IT IS A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS AND

228
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:48,423
WE EMBRACE AND ENCOURAGE PEOPLE

229
00:07:48,423 --> 00:07:49,157
TO APPLY FOR LEGAL CITIZENSHIP.

230
00:07:49,157 --> 00:07:49,824
WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO HAVE

231
00:07:49,824 --> 00:00:00,000
SOME 3,000 FAMILIES, SO HOW IS
