â™ª Bret: FINALLY TONIGHT. IT'S FRIDAY. THAT MEANS NOTABLE QUOTABLES. MAY THERE BE PEACE. MAY GOD BLESS THIS EMBASSY. ALWAYS PROVOKING VIOLENCE ON THE PART OF THE PROBLEM AND NOT PART OF THE SOLUTION. HEAVENLY FATHER. I'M NOT A BIGOT. I'M NOT AN EXTREMIST. MS-13, THESE ARE ANIMALS. IT SEEMS AT TIMES THAT WE LIVE IN AN AGE OF GRIM RELATIVISM. IF WE DO NOT CONFRONT THE CRISIS OF ETHICS AND INTEGRITY. THEN AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AS WE KNOW IT IS ENTERING ITS TWILIGHT YEARS. WE HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP. HE ASKED ME IF I WOULD LIKE AT Z TEMPT E. WHAT ABOUT JOBS IN AMERICA, MR. PRESIDENT? WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE REPORT THAT FIRED? I THINK WE WILL ACTUALLY HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP ASSUMING WE HAVE THE MEETING. I HAVE A LOT FEWER REBOUNDS THAN DENNIS RODMAN BUT I DID GET TO SPEND A GREAT TEAL TIME WITH CHAIRMAN KIM. LET THE PEOPLE READ IT FOR THEMSELVES AND DRAW THEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS. SOME LEAGUES HURT TO HURT COLLEAGUES AND USE THE MEDIA TO SCHIFFY EACH OTHER. WOUNDS TO HEAL. THIS IS WHAT THE HAWAII NATIONAL GUARD IS WORRIED ABOUT LAVA COVERING ROADS. NEVER WATCH SPORTS THE SAME WAY. I'M TAKING THE WARRIORS PLUS ONE AND A HALF. PRINCE CHARLES WILL WALK THE AMERICAN BRIDE DOWN THE AISLE. OF THE PALACE CONFIRMED THIS MORNING. I ALWAYS SAY INTRO INVESTIGATORS WORLD UNITE. I'M NOT GOING TO MEET HIM. THAT WOULD MEAN I HAVE TO LEAVE HOME. MR. SPEAKER, WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THIS PLACE. THAT IS SO OBVIOUS LAUREL AND NOT YANNY. LAUREL.
