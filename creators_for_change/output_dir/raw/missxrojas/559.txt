where I had cold or something like that

7

to me it kind of just seems like

8
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,039
unfortunate timing of headache with

feeling so thanks whoever decides that

22
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:50,370
the only reason why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was at home all</font>

day<font color="#CCCCCC"> today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was waiting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

24
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,840
a package that they tried to deliver

25
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,969
yesterday but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was out there putting</font>

26
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:58,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">meet up which I've got loads of videos</font>

27
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,809
and stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> from when I put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that up</font>

28
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:04,589
sometime when I get the cable out from

29
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:06,450
this book there's about a meter away

30
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,939
from me but I just can't stomach the

31
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:11,070
energy to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now in other</font>

32
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,520
ones I suck so there you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go and more</font>

33
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that package later I explain more</font>

34
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:17,970
about that later but the first book that

35
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,220
I was reading today was finishing off

36
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,740
the last 150 pages or so of ink death

37
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,930
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> my favorite of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the three as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

38
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,880
said in your video in<font color="#E5E5E5"> cut always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be my</font>

39
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,979
favorite but I couldn't have thought of

40
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:30,840
a more perfect way to end it there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

41
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,860
one ending for one particular character

42
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,869
everyone assumed was going to happen and

43
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:38,759
it didn't and that made me really happy

44
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,259
cuz everyone else wanted it to happen

45
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,180
and I didn't make me your winner and

46
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good it is it doesn't stop</font>

47
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:48,689
tie you up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world of words until</font>

48
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:51,540
the end and i love the quotations at the

49
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,920
beginning of every chapter even for

50
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,180
books<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've read they have blows from</font>

51

55
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,189
every chapter for example

56
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:07,679
the journal in chrome is randomly

57
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:09,149
selected page that<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened to open at</font>

58
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:10,530

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like verging on 14 plus not</font>

65
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,160
because of content but because of the

66
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,720
fact that you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have to kind</font>

67
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,430
of push yourself with it but not in like
