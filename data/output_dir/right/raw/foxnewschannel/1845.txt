1
00:00:00,733 --> 00:00:06,572
SIMPSON DID NOT RESPOND TO FOX'S

2
00:00:06,572 --> 00:00:08,039
QUESTION ON THE SOURCE.

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,942
MAR HARTHANK YOU.

4
00:00:09,942 --> 00:00:11,577
REPRESENTATIVE PETER KING WHO

5
00:00:11,577 --> 00:00:12,845
SITS ON THE INTELLIGENCE

6
00:00:12,845 --> 00:00:13,279
COMMISSION.

7
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:15,981
AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING US

8
00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:16,682
TONIGHT.

9
00:00:16,682 --> 00:00:18,918
VERY STRONG PIECE BY KIM,

10
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:24,523
SUGGESTING THAT POTENTIALLY AN

11
00:00:24,523 --> 00:00:26,692
OUTFIT IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, DO

12
00:00:26,692 --> 00:00:29,195
YOU THINK THAT IS THE CASE?

13
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,797
>> WE HAVE REASON THAT THERE

14
00:00:31,797 --> 00:00:33,732
COULD HAVE BEEN AN FBI SPY IN

15
00:00:33,732 --> 00:00:35,401
THE CAMPAIGN AND SOMEONE

16
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:36,869
AFFILIATED WITH THE FBI AND

17
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:38,537
DEALING WITH THE PEOPLE IN THE

18
00:00:38,537 --> 00:00:39,438
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

19
00:00:39,438 --> 00:00:41,440
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE

20
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,042
ARE TRYING TO PIN DOWN AND MAKE

21
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,743
SURE IT IS THE CASE.

22
00:00:44,743 --> 00:00:49,114
IF IT IS, IT RAISES SERIOUS

23
00:00:49,114 --> 00:00:49,515
QUESTIONS.

24
00:00:49,515 --> 00:00:51,517
THERE IS NO REASON WHY THE

25
00:00:51,517 --> 00:00:53,886
INVESTIGATION BEGAN IN THE FIRST

26
00:00:53,886 --> 00:00:58,691
PLACE AND WHY THE FISA WAS

27
00:00:58,691 --> 00:00:59,158
GIVEN.

28
00:00:59,158 --> 00:01:00,392
WHO ROLE WAS IT.

29
00:01:00,392 --> 00:01:03,095
IF HE WAS AN FBI OPERATIVE.

30
00:01:03,095 --> 00:01:06,498
AND WAS HE PUT THERE BY THE FBI?

31
00:01:06,498 --> 00:01:09,335
YOU HAVE A FBI SPYING ON THE

32
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:10,769
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN AND THERE

33
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:12,705
ARE CONSEQUENCES TO THIS.

34
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:15,975
THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED IN

35
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:16,675
AMERICAN HISTORY.

36
00:01:16,675 --> 00:01:20,579
AND IF THERE WAS A REAL

37
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:21,380
JUSTIFICATION AND MAYBE YOU

38
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:21,947
CONSIDER IT.

39
00:01:21,947 --> 00:01:25,017
BUT IN THIS CASE, THERE IS IT NO

40
00:01:25,017 --> 00:01:27,019
CONSIDERATION IN THE BEGINNING.

41
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:28,020
INVESTIGATION AND NEVER MIND

42
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,657
HAVING A SPY IN THE CAMPAIGN.

43
00:01:31,657 --> 00:01:34,560
>> Martha: DEVIN NUNEZ AND TREY

44
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,894
GOWDY WERE BROUGHT OVER TO LOOK

45
00:01:35,894 --> 00:01:38,163
AT THE DOCUMENTS AND THEY WERE

46
00:01:38,163 --> 00:01:40,733
NOT GIVEN THE DOCUMENTS TO LOOK

47
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:41,900
AT THEMSELVES.

48
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,235
AND THEY WERE BRIEFED ON THE

49
00:01:43,235 --> 00:01:46,205
DOCUMENTS AND ADDED TO THE

50
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:48,807
NOTION, CONGRESSMAN, THEY ARE SO

51
00:01:48,807 --> 00:01:50,376
CLOSE TO THE VEST WITH ALL OF

52
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:53,979
THE INFORMATION AND EVEN WITH

53
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:56,548
THE CONGRESSIONAL JOBS IT IS TO

54
00:01:56,548 --> 00:01:59,518
HAVE OVERSIGHT OF JUDARY AND

55
00:01:59,518 --> 00:01:59,985
INTELLIGENCE?

56
00:01:59,985 --> 00:02:02,454
>> YEAH, YOU ARE RIGHT.

57
00:02:02,454 --> 00:02:04,523
THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO HOLD IT

58
00:02:04,523 --> 00:02:04,857
BACK.

59
00:02:04,857 --> 00:02:07,159
AND THE FBI HAS LEAKED THINGS TO

60
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,428
THE MEDIA AND THAT ARE CONCERNED

61
00:02:09,428 --> 00:02:10,829
ABOUT GETTING IT OUT.

62
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:12,798
NO, IT IS TITLE TO THE

63
00:02:12,798 --> 00:02:16,835
INVESTIGATION AND VITAL TO KNOW

64
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:20,372
WHAT HAPPENED AND ANDREW McCABE.

65
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:22,241
AND THE INVESTIGATION AND PEOPLE

66
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:24,610
RESIGNING AND PEOPLE MAY BE

67
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,211
INDICTED AND THEY WERE RUNNING

68
00:02:26,211 --> 00:02:27,980
THE INVESTIGATION AND ADD THE

69
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,781
ELEMENT TO IT.

70
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:30,883
AND IT IS AMAZING PRESIDENT

71
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:33,819
TRUMP IS TARGETED HERE AND

72
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:35,421
INVESTIGATED AND SO MUCH WENT

73
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:37,690
WRONG IN THE OTHER FBI END AND

74
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,626
RIGHT NOW THEY ARE STONE WALLING

75
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:41,093
US.

76
00:02:41,093 --> 00:02:44,196
AND THIS IS JUST ANOTHER ADD.

77
00:02:44,196 --> 00:02:48,267
THE PRESIDENT CAN ORDER THEM TO

78
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:48,384
RE

79
00:02:48,384 --> 00:02:48,701
R

80
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:51,236
RELEASE THIS.

81
00:02:51,236 --> 00:02:53,105
IF THEY CAN'T FIND A REASONABLE

82
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:54,840
SOLUTION THE PRESIDENT CAN.

83
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,742
>> Martha: YOU HAVE AN

84
00:02:56,742 --> 00:02:58,444
INDICATION HE WOULD LIKE TO DO

85
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,312
THAT AND IF NOT, WHY NOT?

86
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:02,281
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS

87
00:03:02,281 --> 00:03:04,049
GETTING CLOSER TO THAT.

88
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:06,085
AND THEY TRIED TO CONVINCE THE

89
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:07,953
PRESIDENT IN THE LAST WEEK OR

90
00:03:07,953 --> 00:03:08,587
SO.

91
00:03:08,587 --> 00:03:10,422
THE FBI AND JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

92
00:03:10,422 --> 00:03:14,259
DID THAT GIVING THE INFORMATION

93
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:16,261
WOULD COST SOMEONE'S LIFE AT

94
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:16,595
RISK.

95
00:03:16,595 --> 00:03:17,663
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

96
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:19,231
THE PRESIDENT IS STARTING TO

97
00:03:19,231 --> 00:03:21,200
REALIZE THEY ARE PUTTING ONE

98
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,167
OVER ON HIM.

99
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:24,370
>> Martha: WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT

100
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,339
GLENN SIMPSON TESTIFIED IN FRONT

101
00:03:27,339 --> 00:03:29,141
OF THE COMMITTEE, THE REASON

102
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:32,311
THEY BELIEVED CHRISTOPHER

103
00:03:32,311 --> 00:03:34,213
STEELE'S DOSSIER THEY HAD AN

104
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:38,617
INTERNAL SOURCE IN THE CAMPAIGN

105
00:03:38,617 --> 00:03:40,552
THAT COROBRATED THIS.

106
00:03:40,552 --> 00:03:42,521
AND LOOK AT THE UNMASKINGS AND

107
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:44,256
THE EARLY STAGES OF THIS.

108
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,559
IT FEELS LIKE IT IS POSSIBLE

109
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:49,094
THEY HAD SOMEBODY WHO WAS INSIDE

110
00:03:49,094 --> 00:03:51,330
AND CONFIRMING SOME OF THIS FOR

111
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:51,663
THEM.

112
00:03:51,663 --> 00:03:53,866
AND IF THAT IS THE CASE AND THEY

113
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:56,635
FEEL THEY HAVE A LEGITIMATE

114
00:03:56,635 --> 00:03:58,737
RUSSIAN COLLUSION INVESTIGATION,

115
00:03:58,737 --> 00:04:00,172
WHY WOULD NOT THEY BE WILLING TO

116
00:04:00,172 --> 00:04:02,508
SAY THIS IS THE EVIDENCE AND

117
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:03,976
MAKE SURE WE GOT THIS

118
00:04:03,976 --> 00:04:05,110
INFORMATION THIS WAY?

119
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:09,148
>> THEY CAN TURN IT AROUND ON US

120
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:12,651
COMPLETELY IF THEY CAN SHOW THAT

121
00:04:12,651 --> 00:04:14,219
THIS PERSON WAS SIGNIFICANT.

122
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:16,321
AND IT IS ALL UNRAVELLING IN

123
00:04:16,321 --> 00:04:19,791
FRONT OF THEM AND DOING ALL THEY

124
00:04:19,791 --> 00:00:00,000
CAN TO COVER THEMSELVES.
