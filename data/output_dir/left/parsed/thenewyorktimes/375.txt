It was about three o'clock
when the water started coming
into our house and 
we saw everything that we own
just floating.
It's all gone. 
All we loved it was up to
my knees in the house.
All of our stuff was gone.
Everything in our house, our car,
everything was gone.
I got my wife out, 
I got my dog and our cat.
I got my 80-year-old father
with type 2 diabetes out.
I had to wade through 
chest-high water.
We finally got onto
a decent half.
The National Guard came and got us.
And they took us to a shelter
on Aldine Mail Rte Rd.
Aldine Westfield.
And it was terrible.
It was crowded very,
very crazy.
You know, I mean they're
doing their best but they
weren't ready for it,
nobody in Houston was ready for it.
So now we are at this shelter,
we finally got out,
They are doing such
an amazing job helping
everybody and making sure
they're dry
and have food and a place to stay.
We lost everything, we left out
with the clothes on our bags,
and our animals and 
we don't know what to do.
Now we know we have to rebuild
but it's devastating to see the amount
of pain everybody's in,
everybody lost everything.
