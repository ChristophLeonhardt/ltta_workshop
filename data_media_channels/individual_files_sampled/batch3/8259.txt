HOUSE IS EXPECTED TO VOTE ON THE BILL NEXT WEEK. I'M ROBERT GRAY AND NOW BACK TO THE GREG GUTFELD SHOW. GREG: FINALLY, A DEMOCRAT ADMITS THAT TRUMP'S DIPLOMACY MIGHT BE WORKING. THE SUMMIT WAS MUCH MORE SHOW THAN SUBSTANCE BUT THE TEXANS CALL ALL CATTLE, NO HAT. ALL CATTLE AND NO HAT. TRUMP IS ALL SUBSTANCE HOW NICE OF MR. SCHUMER. OF COURSE, CHUCK GOT IT WRONG AND HE MADE THE OPPOSITE BUT I CAN'T BLAME HIM BECAUSE HE'S ALL HERE PLUG AND NO CATTLE. TRUMPS CRITICS ALWAYS PHONE TO GIBBERISH IN THEIR NEW SMEAR NOW IS IT'S A CULT. IT HAS DEVOLVED INTO A CULT. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS DEVOLVED INTO A TRUMP CULT. THESE GUYS ARE IN A CULT AND DRINK THE COOL EYED, I DON'T KNOW. IT'S BECOMING A CULT. THAT IS HARD NEWS FOR THE REPUBLICANS THAT YOU ARE IN A CULT. GREG: THEY ALL SOUND THE SAME AS IF THEY ARE IN A CULT. A PROFITABLE ONE. THE MORE THEY BACK TRUMP THE HIGHER IN THE RATINGS. THE TRUMP BUMP IS PAIN FOR THEIR BOTOX. IT EXPOSES THE LIES THAT THERE IS A PRESS CRACKDOWN UNDER TRUMP INDUSTRY HAS NEVER BEEN MORE VOCAL IN OPPOSITION IN THE PREVIOUS EIGHT YEARS WITH THE MEDIA UNDER OBAMA TALK ABOUT A CULT. THEY WERE OBAMA TOAST. YOU CAN HATE TRUMP, LOVE TRUMP AND I DON'T REALLY EVEN CARE BUT TARGETING PEOPLE THEIR ALL HAT AND NO CATTLE BUT THEY'RE ALL HAT AND NO JACKASS. TO BE FAIR, TYRUS, EVERYBODY THANKS SOMEONE ELSE IS IN A CULPRIT IF YOU DON'T LIKE THEM OR LIKE THEIR BELIEFS YOU SAY THEY ARE IN A CULT. TYRUS: CULT IS THE NEW CODE WORD FOR JACKASS. OR I DON'T LIKE YOU. IT'S THE NEW THING. SAYING BUT DID TRY TO FIX IT AND THAT IS HE DID NOT KNOW BUT HIS ASSISTANT NEW AND HIS ASSISTANT LET IT GO BUT YOU MIGHT WANT TO HOLLER AT THE GUY BECAUSE GET A GOOD LOOK YOU COULD STICK YOUR HEAD UP A COWS ASS WHERE IS THE GUY THAT WROTE THIS? THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING IN THEIR RUNNING OUT OF STUFF. NOW THEY ARE POSSESSED OF THE DEVIL. AND YOU CAN'T ARGUE THAT. GREG: IS A CALL THAT BAD, CAT QUESTION. KAT: NOT TO THE PEOPLE IN IT. I DO SEEM LIKE I WOULD BE THE TYPE BUT I HAVE MANAGED TO STEER CLEAR OF IT WOULD NOT FEEL GOOD TO BELONG, YOU KNOW, BUT I HAVE NOT GONE THAT FAR YET. IT'S ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE SOMEONE TRY TO INSULT SOMEONE AND THEY DO IT WRONG. GREG: IT'S FANTASTIC. KAT: IT'S LIKE IF YOU TRY TO PUNCH SOMEONE IN THE FACE ANY MISS AND YOU HIT THE WALL AND YOU BREAK YOUR HAND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HE DID THERE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND I GET HE WAS TRYING TO BE RELATABLE BUT THE INTERNET MAKES IT SUPER EASY TO BE RELATABLE. IF YOU ARE NOT SURE YOU GOOGLE IT. THERE IS NO WAY IT'S NOT LIKE WE RELY ON ORAL HISTORIES TO KNOW WHAT PEOPLE IN THE OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY ARE DOING. YOU CAN GOOGLE IT. IT'S SO EASY. GREG: HE PROBABLY CALLS IT THE GOOGLE. WHERE IS THE GOOGLE? I LEFT IT SOMEWHERE ON MY PHONE. WALTER, THE GOOGLE. THEY DON'T HIRE WRITERS AND THAT'S THE BIG PROBLEM WITH HOLLYWOOD POLITICS AND EVERYTHING ELSE. I THINK ANY POLITICIAN THAT HAS A POPULIST FIELD WHETHER TRUMP OR OBAMA OR WHOEVER IT IS SARAH PALIN, FOR EXAMPLE, ALL THESE PEOPLE HAVE THAT POPULIST FEEL AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS YOU DO HAVE A SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION THAT CAN FEEL A LITTLE CULTISH. THEY FOLLOW YOU NO MATTER WHAT AND LOOK UP TO YOU AND BECOME A PERSONALITY RATHER THAN A POLITICIAN OR SOME, NATION. ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE ALSO TAKE A TON OF HEAT. TRUMP TAKES HEAT FROM THE MEDIA EVERY DAY. SARAH PALIN, SAME THING. YEAH, THERE IS A CULTISH SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION BUT SO WHAT? TO SAY THAT TRUMP HAS CULTISH FOLLOWERS AND OBAMA DID NOT, EVERY PERSON ON THAT PANEL WAS CULTISH FOR OBAMA. COME ON QUESTION IS.
