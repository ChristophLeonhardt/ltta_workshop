INCLUDING, HE HAS THAT, CHINESE
PRESIDENT XI.
A LOT OF WORK AHEAD.
>> Shannon: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
OUR NEXT GUEST WAS REPORTEDLY A
BIT SURPRISED BY THE PRESIDENT'S
BOLD STEP WITH REGARD TO THE
JOINT MILITARY EXERCISES WITH
SOUTH KOREA.
HOW IS HE FEELING TONIGHT?
REPUBLICAN SENATOR MIKE ROUNDS
SAID ON THE SENATE ARMED
SERVICES COMMITTEE AND HE JOINS
US LIVE.
>> I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY.
>> Shannon: YOU SAID YOU WERE
SURPRISED HE WENT THAT FAR.
SECRETARY POMPEO SAID, TO BE
CLEAR, IT IS ONLY PREMISED ON
THE FACT THAT A GOOD
NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE, GOOD
FAITH NEGOTIATIONS ON BOTH
SIDES.
OTHERWISE, THE EXERCISES ARE
BACK ON.
YOU HAVE CLARITY ON IT TONIGHT?
>> MORE THAN WE DID BEFORE.
IT WASN'T CANCELING.
WHAT HE'S DOING IS, WE'LL TAKE A
BREAK.
AND FOR NORTH KOREA, THIS IS A
BIG DEAL.
FOR US, WE DO THIS ON A REGULAR
BASIS, IT'S OUR PRACTICED
INVASION OF NORTH KOREA.
AND WE DO THAT WITH SOUTH KOREA.
>> Shannon: WELL, WHEN YOU PUT
IT THAT WAY...
>> WE PARTICIPATE WITH JAPAN AS
WELL.
FOR NORTH KOREA, THIS WAS
SOMETHING THEY WERE LOOKING AT.
YOU GOT TO REMEMBER, THESE CAN
BE REINSTATED VERY QUICKLY.
AND IT'S JUST LIKE WHEN THERE
WERE PROBLEMS OF DEVELOPING THE
SUMMIT TO BEGIN WITH, THE
PRESIDENT COULD STEP BACK AND
SAY, THE DEAL IS OFF, WE WANT TO
HAVE THE SUMMIT.
ONCE THERE WAS ADDITIONAL
DEAL BACK ON AND HAVE IT ON THE
SAME DATES.
THE SAME THING CAN OCCUR HERE.
LET'S GIVE THE PRESIDENT OF THE
TO SUCCEED.
EVERYTHING STARTS WITH A FIRST
SET.
THIS WAS A FIRST STEP.
IT WAS A VERY GOOD FIRST STEP.
LOTS ALLOW THE PRESIDENT TO SOME
LEEWAY, LET'S GIVE HIM THE
OPPORTUNITY, TRY TO NEGOTIATE
SOMETHING BESIDES GOING TO WAR.
>> Shannon: I WANT TO PLAY A
LITTLE BIT OF WHAT ONE OF YOUR
COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE AISLE, TOP
SENATE DEMOCRATS CHUCK SCHUMER
HAD TO SAY ABOUT WHERE WE ARE
NOW.
>> OUR ADVERSARIES, RUSSIA AND
CHINA, HAVE GAINED WHILE I ARE
ALLIES LIKE SOUTH KOREA AND
JAPAN, HAVE LOST FOOTING.
AND TO SOME DEGREE OF FAITH IN
AMERICA'S RELIABILITY.
>> Shannon: WE KNOW THE
SECRETARY POMPEO HAS TALKED TO
THE COUNTERPARTS IN SOUTH KOREA
AS HE HEADS TO CHINA NOW.
DO YOU AGREE WITH MR. SCHUMER'S
ASSESSMENT?
>> I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE.
NUMBER ONE, CHINA CLEARLY HAD A
ROLE TO PLAY HERE.
THEY PARTICIPATED.
SOUTH KOREA WANTS THIS TO
HAPPEN.
JAPAN DOES NOT WANT TO BE IN THE
MIDDLE OF AN ARMED CONFLICT
RIGHT NOW.
THEY ARE CLOSER TO NORTH KOREA
THAN WE ARE.
THEY RECOGNIZE THEY HAVE
MULTIPLE TYPES OF WEAPONS.
NORTH KOREA HAS MORE THAN JUST
NUCLEAR WEAPONS, THEY HAVE
BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS, CHEMICAL
WEAPONS AND SO FORTH.
SOUTH KOREA WOULD FEEL THE BRUNT
OF IT.
JAPAN IS OF A TARGET AS WELL.
THEY WANT TO SEE THIS
PEACEFUL-ALLY RESOLVE.
THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE IN OR
GIVE THEM SOMETHING THEY
WOULDN'T NORMALLY HAVE.
THIS PRESIDENT, THE OPPORTUNITY
TO HAVE MORE THAN JUST WANT TO
HAVE COME ALLOW HIM A CHANCE TO
GET OUT OF A MESS THAT HAS BEEN
CREATED OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF
DECADES, THAT IS WITH THIS
PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO DO.
I THINK AMERICA SHOULD BE
SUPPORTING THE PRESIDENT IN
TERMS OF, LET'S FIND A WAY TO
PEACEFULLY GET AROUND THIS.
AMERICA JUST DOES NOT GO OUT AND
LOOK FOR WARS.
WE TRY OUR BEST TO RESOLVE THEM.
SOMETIMES, BY HAVING A VERY,
VERY STRONG OFFENSE AND A VERY
STRONG DEFENSE, YOU CAN
SOMETIMES CONVINCE SOME OF YOUR
ADVERSARIES THAT IT'S BETTER TO
FIND A PEACEFUL SOLUTION THEN TO
CONTINUE TO POKE AT.
>> Shannon: YOU BEEN INVOLVED
WITH SOMETHING UNDER THE RADAR,
THIS NEWS ABOUT CHINA, HACKING
INTO INFORMATION ALLEGEDLY
INVOLVING OUR SUBMARINE PROGRAM.
I WANT TO READ YOU SOMETHING
FROM "THE WASHINGTON POST."
COMPROMISED THE COMPUTERS OF A
NAVY CONTRACTOR STEALING MASSIVE
AMOUNTS OF HIGHLY SENSITIVE DATA
RELATED TO UNDERSEA WARFARE,
INCLUDING SECRET PLANS TO
DEVELOP A SUPERSONIC ANTISHIP
MISSILE FOR USE ON U.S.
SUBMARINES BY 2020."
YOU NOW ASK THE NAVY TO EXPLAIN
WHAT HAS HAPPENED.
ARE YOU GETTING A BRIEFING?
WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP?
>> WE ASKED FOR THE BRIEFING.
I SERVE AS A SUBCOMMITTEE
CHAIRMEN ON CYBER SECURITY FOR
THE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE.
I ASKED TO FIND OUT WHAT
HAPPENED WHY WE HAVEN'T BEEN
ADVISED EARLY ON WHAT THIS
LOOKS LIKE.
IT IS NOT THE FIRST TIME
SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAS
HAPPENED.
WE HAD INFORMATION ON THE F3535
BREACH.
WE HAD ON A REGULAR BASIS PEOPLE
TRYING TO GET INTO OUR SYSTEMS.
IT IS NOT JUST WITHIN THE
PENTAGON, IT IS WITHIN THE
CONTRACTORS, WITHIN THE CRITICAL
INFRASTRUCTURE.
THERE ARE FIVE DIFFERENT DOMAINS
IN WHICH YOU CAN GO TO WAR.
AIR, LAND, SEA, SPACE, AND
CYBERSPACE.
WHEN IT COMES TO CYBERSPACE, WE
ARE BEING ATTACKED EVERY SINGLE
DAY, THOUSANDS OF TIMES PER DAY.
OUR SYSTEMS CAN'T SIMPLY
WITHSTAND THAT TYPE OF AN ATTACK
ALL THE TIME WITHOUT RESPONDING.
WE ARE WORKING OUT NOT ONLY
STRENGTHENING OUR DEFENSES BUT
AS THE DOD ACTUALLY
SUGGESTED A YEAR AGO LAST
FEBRUARY, WE HAVE TO HAVE A VERY
PROMPTED OFFENSE BUT WE ARE NOT
AFRAID TO GO AFTER THESE FOLKS W
AFRAID TO GO AFTER THESE FOLKS O
AFRAID TO GO AFTER THESE FOLKS A
AFRAID TO GO AFTER THESE FOLKS E
CONSTANTLY TRYING TO GET INSIDE
OF OUR SYSTEMS.
NUMBER ONE, GOTTA FIND OUT WHAT
DAMAGE WAS DONE.
SECOND OF ALL, GOTTA FIND OUT
HOW THEY GOT IN AND WHAT WE CAN
DO TO RESPOND ACCORDINGLY, NOT
JUST THIS TIME COME BUT IN THE
FUTURE AS WELL.
