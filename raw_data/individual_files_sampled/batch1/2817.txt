I do get called a rodeo clown quite often it's just a process of evolution I guess originally the rodeo clown was out there to entertain the crowd and protect the bull riders nowadays it's two separate positions flinters person is up there doing all the funny stuff keeping the people happy and Frank Newsom Shorty Gorham and I are in charge of protection every time these guys do what they do is the most dangerous thing in the way here Madison Square Garden 35 guys are going to get on a bull for 35 attempts our bullfighters have to be there ready to throw their body sacrifice themselves to protect these guys that are getting on these books you know you're never gonna outrun a bull so or legs outrun - real quick and it's all about angles and timing you've got to be really quick to get in the right position at the right time and once you get that bull's attention and have him come in your direction you've got to kind of work your way towards his shoulder it's what we call the pocket it's kind of your safety zone they can't actually bend their body around far enough to reach us and we rely heavily on each other as teammates out there to distract the bull from one another and the goal is that that all of us walk away safe the bond we've formed as a trio is just something that's really hard to put into words we've kind of got this this unspoken way of communicating when we're in the arena and we seem to know one another are at all times and you know at the end of the day we've all got each other's back to the point where you know if you go down you've got the confidence that you know that your teammates going to be in there doing anything he can to get the ball off you
