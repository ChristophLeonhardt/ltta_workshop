I will be bolder I will be braver I can
achieve it I am capable I can stand up
for myself I will take credit where
credit is due to me I will value these
people who stand by my side and respect
me and I will be generous with my time
with them I will both think and read
more broadly I will be kind to myself I
will run harder everything's going to be
okay everything is going to be amazing
