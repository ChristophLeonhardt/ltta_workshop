want<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a little bit about Melania</font>

11
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,890
Trump's speech last night which has been

12
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,260
pretty big topic since it happened yeah

13
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,380
a fairly<font color="#CCCCCC"> similar to michelle obama</font>

14
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,140
speech in 2008 I don't know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you</font>

15
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,430
guys thoughts is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to hurt the</font>

16
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,590
Trump campaign these accusations of

17
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,809
plagiarism well first of all let me just

18
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">say that it seems as if nothing could</font>

19
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,430
possibly hurt Trump's campaign he's

20
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,899
gotten away with saying some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the most</font>

21
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,300
ludicrous things imaginable so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

22
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">of him you know suffering any</font>

23
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,009
consequences for her allegedly

24
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:14,660
plagiarizing the speech seems

25
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,509
inconceivable but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will say that you</font>

26
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:18,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">know the way the media is portraying</font>

27
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:22,040
this is a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> questionable because</font>

28
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,900
there are components of the speech like

29
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,479
I would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe two sentences that are</font>

30
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,909
clearly cases of plagiarism because she

31
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:32,510
uses like the same wording as Michelle

32
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,400
Obama and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of political speeches</font>

33
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,490
use the same type of rhetoric and so I

34
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,310
see them I see journalists reaching by

35
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,110
giving examples that I don't think

36
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">really fit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the definition of plagiarism</font>

37
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,500
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there are at least</font>

38
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,990
two sentences in there where the wording

39
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,090
is just too similar and it's a little

40
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,470
too much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a coincidence if you know</font>

41
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,820
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean there are definitely some</font>

42
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'll say suspicious things yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean</font>

43
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,380
if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the speech itself they're</font>

44
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,090
like you're saying there are lines their

45
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,729
words their phrases you know values you

46
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:03,200
work hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> for and what you want in life</font>

47
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,790
values that we look hard for and what

48
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,340
you want in life that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's really</font>

49
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,079
specific it's almost like it my first

50
00:02:09,079 --> 00:02:12,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought was I know she googled first</font>

51
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,480
lady speeches and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of pulled</font>

52
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,519
from that well actually can I jump in

53
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:19,400
about that um one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think a</font>

54
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Americans don't know and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

55
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:24,669
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the media certainly know it is that</font>

56
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:27,080
no politician right Starla

57
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay no public figure that's involved in</font>

58
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,300
the political spectrum<font color="#E5E5E5"> writes their own</font>

59
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,860
speech so Melania Trump didn't write

60
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,300
that speech someone else wrote it for

61
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,160
her so there are calls to fire the

62
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,660
speech writer which you know that's I

63
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,150
guess up in the air but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's a</font>

64
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,130
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> big problem in politics because I</font>

65
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,750
don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hear what some speech</font>

66
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,910
writer has to say sure they might convey

67
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,970
the ideas of the politician but in the

68
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,590
case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Melania Trump I don't think that</font>

69
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,930
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> speech writer did I think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

70
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,730
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone who's writing a script for</font>

71
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,190
her to regurgitate<font color="#E5E5E5"> on stage and that in</font>

72
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">my opinion is the real unacceptable</font>

73
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,540
component of this sure I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> completely</font>

74
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,640
agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're hearing from</font>

75
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,470
politicians all the time what a speech

76
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,790
writer thinks will sell<font color="#CCCCCC"> to an audience</font>

77
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,610
yep in this particular issue I just

78
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's in confidence I think some</font>

79
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,120
speech writer was just I mean apparently

80
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,470
there was a rickroll in the speech as

81
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,209
well someone clearly did not care about

82
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:19,400
their job and now it's hit one of the

83
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,709
biggest political events of the year and

84
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:23,870
that but what I will say when you asked

85
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">about whether an egg ative Lee impact</font>

86
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,350
Trump yep no way I don't look we're

87
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,240
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now all this is</font>

88
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">gonna do is make him the limelight again</font>

89
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,019
we're seeing image after image comparing

90
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:35,390
michelle obama to Melania Trump and now

91
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,739
he's dominating the news cycle once

92
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:38,480
again yep I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think yeah I think it's a</font>

93
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,630
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> point so we're really here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

94
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,570
about protests which have been such a

95
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,870
central<font color="#E5E5E5"> part to Donald Trump's campaign</font>

96
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:51,080
since the start<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it and the most</font>

97
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,940
notable protest so far has actually been

98
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,920
inside the convention center which is

99
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,010
incredible and if you can tell us<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

100
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:01,040
happened there yes so there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

101
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,010
delegates that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not fans of Donald</font>

102
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,510
Trump and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're part of what's</font>

103
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,519
referred<font color="#CCCCCC"> to as the nevertrump camp and</font>

104
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,040
what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do is completely</font>

105
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,010
ignore the caucus results or the primary

106
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,959
results in their own state and go

107
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,700
against what the people in their state

108
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,700
wanted and basically vote against Trump

109
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,430
and the RNC took certain measures on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

110
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,320
floor yesterday to prevent that from

111
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,530
happening so they worked with certain

112
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,600
delegates or certain delegations there

113
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,979
were nine delegations that were part of

114
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,229
this never Trump strategy they worked

115
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:34,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">with certain individuals in those</font>

116
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,919
delegations to convince them to

117
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:39,930
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> side with Trump and the RNC</font>

118
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,840
so two of the delegations didn't have

119
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,229
the signatures necessary to be to carry

120
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:48,330
out their action essentially but I think

121
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,800
the easiest way to understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

122
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,320
those who wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to vote against Trump</font>

123
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,600
will not have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do so and</font>

124
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,570
so a protest erupted as a result of that

125
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,610
right i mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that's super</font>

126
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,949
interesting that even within the

127
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:03,539
convention hall<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's still this</font>

128
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:06,509
intensity against Trump which I don't

129
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:08,699
recall<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing in any other any other</font>

130
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:11,160
election in my lifetime I mean I'm 26 so

131
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,770
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that many but it's enough to</font>

132
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,539
know that this is something definitely

133
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:19,740
unprecedented and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> besides d what</font>

134
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,180
happens inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> the floor on the</font>

135
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,660
convention floor we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> expecting huge</font>

136
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,180
protests outside the convention which

137
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,270
tim has come out to cover so yeah yeah

138
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:33,840
how is that bin I mean relative to what

139
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,419
we've seen throughout the<font color="#E5E5E5"> year so far</font>

140
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:38,099
boring I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's you know</font>

141
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:39,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone hopes for a peaceful protest</font>

142
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've seen big crowds we've seen people</font>

143
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,639
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the streets at one point a group</font>

144
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,099
jumped a barricade but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's still you</font>

145
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:48,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">know no arrests people you know came</font>

146
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:50,760
back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the park it's very very low key</font>

147
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,849
I mean I've seen people beating each

148
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:55,289
other in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the streets at some of these</font>

149
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:57,930
events and right now at public square

150
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,990
you've got Trump an anti-trump people

151
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,820
just sort of hanging out eating food by

152
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,250
each other and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's very cold yeah I we</font>

153
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,830
uh we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> out after the speeches last</font>

154
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,370
night and spoke some police officers who

155
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,449
didn't seem that<font color="#CCCCCC"> concerned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they were</font>

156
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:14,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">joking around they were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> laughing it was</font>

157
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,860
a you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's kind of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

158
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,159
friendly air for a protest yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I</font>

159
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,009
spoke to a few individuals that felt

160
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:25,860
some tension among police officials I

161
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,020
mean that's anecdotal um but

162
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,240
interestingly enough I got into a bit of

163
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,190
a verbal altercation as I was leaving

164
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,580
the convention last night with I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

165
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a name who he is but he's a</font>

166
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,090
somewhat of a pig a public figure that I

167
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,889
disagree with and so we exchanged words

168
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:44,130
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was very hostile and there were cops</font>

169
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,349
there profanity was like thrown around

170
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:48,330
and the cops<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of laughed it off</font>

171
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,440
yeah which I thought was interesting

172
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,740
as if they were feeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> threatened in</font>

173
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,990
any way you know by protesters or by the

174
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,820
environment in general I feel like the

175
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,620
reaction to the exchange would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been</font>

176
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,270
a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> different I think so too oh</font>

177
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,580
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I there was one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> incident</font>

178
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,770
where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know Alex Jones is throwing</font>

179
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:06,940
this big rally down by the waterfront

180
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,880
and about 50 protesters came down just

181
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">before my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lowly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> annapolis was going to</font>

182
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,390
speak so he's a very controversial

183
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,820
figure that was as tense as I've seen it

184
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,320
just people yelling<font color="#E5E5E5"> at each other</font>

185
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,590
between a cop you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a line of cops</font>

186
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,240
but one thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I guess the</font>

187
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,740
bigger issue that everyone sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

188
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,400
worried about when it comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

189
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,560
protests is the string of violence we've

190
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,870
seen targeting police yet having to do

191
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,850
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> like black lives matter earlier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

192
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,130
morning reuters reported that there were

193
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,530
shots fired at a police transport but

194
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,300
then quickly the Cleveland Police

195
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,920
refuted that claim tweeted out there

196
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,230
were no shots fired but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we're</font>

197
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,370
rushing to the car were<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

198
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,840
tensions are rising we're like we've got

199
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,370
bulletproof vests ready for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff</font>

200
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,690
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah but then nothing ends up</font>

201
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,270
happening yeah it's it and I almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font>

202
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,760
like that's that's a factor of the

203
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,520
police being so I would almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> say over</font>

204
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,919
prepared for for this event<font color="#CCCCCC"> because uh</font>

205
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:59,080
if I've checked my notes but about I

206
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,210
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 million dollars is being spent</font>

207
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,150
on security there's a 5500 law

208
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,070
enforcement agents and they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

209
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,050
only expecting about 10,000 protesters<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

210
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,140
mean only but you know one cop for every

211
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,210
two protesters that's that's really

212
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,860
being prepared yeah i<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean look</font>

213
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,750
considering the current political

214
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">climate and also considering that we are</font>

215
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,230
in an open carry gun<font color="#CCCCCC"> state yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font>

216
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,880
think there is any such thing as being

217
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,160
too prepared<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did feel a little scared</font>

218
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,070
coming here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot calmer now that</font>

219
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,190
I see just how intense security is but I

220
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,589
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> security I wanted a significant</font>

221
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:37,089
chunk of that budget to go toward

222
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:39,490
ensuring that everyone here would be

223
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:42,880
safe and luckily I do feel safe I agree

224
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,570
to and I and part of it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we do</font>

225
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,060
almost expect violence now at Trump

226
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,400
rallies at Trump events and so for what

227
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,010
is one of the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> trump events were</font>

228
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,680
the biggest so far uh it really<font color="#CCCCCC"> does</font>

229
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">feel like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's that lacking of</font>

230
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,270
protest even especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> as Trump was</font>

231
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,490
hauling for violence you know himself

232
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,300
like early

233
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,880
earlier on in the in his<font color="#E5E5E5"> campaign it's</font>

234
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,500
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of crazy don't count your chickens</font>

235
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,600
before they hatch this is day<font color="#CCCCCC"> two yeah</font>

236
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,240
it's just the evening right now we're

237
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">hearing that there may be an inadvertent</font>

238
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,320
protest later later in the night there's

239
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,480
uh there's there you know you know right

240
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">profits of reg having a huge show and so</font>

241
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,250
it's not so much about these permitted

242
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,530
protests and these these<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

243
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">speaking but whether or not people might</font>

244
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,800
gather somewhere for some reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

245
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,540
that can turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a massive protest</font>

246
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're saying like a spontaneous protest</font>

247
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,860
still totally in the cards still play

248
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,930
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean if we're going to see</font>

249
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,850
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> violent it's going to it's not</font>

250
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,740
gonna be a permitted protest it's either

251
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,300
going to be a permanent protest that

252
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,280
decides to go off<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rails or it's</font>

253
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,180
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a group of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

254
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,580
gathered for some other reason and then

255
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,780
they're gonna you know that group comes

256
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,520
together they<font color="#E5E5E5"> get their energy gets all</font>

257
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,990
riled up and then something might come

258
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,640
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it that's almost the thing is</font>

259
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it was seemingly incredibly</font>

260
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,750
difficult for protest groups to even get

261
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,400
permits i believe the ACLU filed

262
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,230
lawsuits on behalf of several groups

263
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,510
that were waiting on protest or permits

264
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,150
or were denied<font color="#CCCCCC"> permits and part of it</font>

265
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">almost I wonder what the balance is</font>

266
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,780
between being able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> express yourself</font>

267
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,610
being able to come out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and protest and</font>

268
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,950
the limits of safety<font color="#CCCCCC"> the limits of</font>

269
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:18,040
expecting violence I think it's symbolic

270
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,930
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just of what's happening to</font>

271
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,780
protesters here but what happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> to any</font>

272
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,580
type of protests throughout the country

273
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,610
I mean that is a way of controlling the

274
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,890
population and making sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that any type</font>

275
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,840
of political discourse that those in

276
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,990
power dislike uh is controlled to a

277
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,400
level where it's essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> irrelevant</font>

278
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so I think that's a huge problem</font>

279
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,720
when it comes to our First Amendment and

280
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,790
I love the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PS ACLU is doing the work</font>

281
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,170
that's doing to protect our

282
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,600
constitutional right to gather<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

283
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,170
protest political power and authority

284
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:52,330
sure I gotta say you know the protests

285
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,910
are happening there they're mostly<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to</font>

286
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">that incident there were reports of a</font>

287
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,180
few arrests they found knives and things

288
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,370
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most part you know</font>

289
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,200
at other events<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen much harder</font>

290
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,820
crackdowns much more quickly even at

291
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,430
permitted events so to see I think

292
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well prepared and you know</font>

293
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,230
everyone's hoping for peace but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

294
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,150
never know if that that spark could

295
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,830
happen if you know some protesters show

296
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:15,860
up at the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> minute</font>

297
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,630
I mean we thought there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a lot of</font>

298
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,089
violence in 2008 right and so everyone's

299
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:21,950
wondering is<font color="#E5E5E5"> our we get you know 2012</font>

300
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,290
was called well 2016 be calm as well

301
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,870
it's also interesting because Cleveland

302
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,180
kind of has a comfortable history with

303
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,670
police violence itself and I'm wondering

304
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,579
I mean Tim you being<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there what is</font>

305
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:37,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the actual halibel sense is it is it</font>

306
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:41,450
fear or is it just almost defeat that

307
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,950
that there isn't going to be some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

308
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">of like overwhelming display of protest</font>

309
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a lot of people I've</font>

310
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:50,630
talked to are excited but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

311
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,310
compare this to you know Occupy Wall

312
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,410
Street's or the Trayvon Martin protest

313
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,019
and other black lives matter rallies

314
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:58,820
people are angry and they make demands

315
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,070
and they go out the street in defiance

316
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,870
of the police say they move barricades

317
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,670
they jump barricades you know police

318
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,500
from a line chaos happens you see

319
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,380
bottles being thrown in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anaheim</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

320
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,519
trump rally people are throwing bottles

321
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:12,290
and the cops came and streaked everybody

322
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,930
out mm-hmm but the anger I haven't felt

323
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:17,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">the anger outside you know I was</font>

324
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:19,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about this earlier i have seen</font>

325
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:21,290
Trump supporters and anti-trump people

326
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,990
literally get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> fistfights being left</font>

327
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,610
bloody but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go into public</font>

328
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,829
square today there's Trump hats and

329
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:29,540
anti-trump protesters just standing next

330
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> each other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eating tacos like hey you</font>

331
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">know we're not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really that mad right now</font>

332
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">I love that by the way I mean I want to</font>

333
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,630
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to a point where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

334
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,399
if you guys know of this show called

335
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,130
Unger and steel or steel and hunger I'm

336
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,050
mixing up the names anyway but it's on

337
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,760
POTUS which is a satellite radio show

338
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,829
anyway hunger is democratic<font color="#E5E5E5"> michael</font>

339
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:50,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">steele is you guys all know is</font>

340
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:53,089
Republican and the did like the way they

341
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:55,070
speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> to one another the discourse is</font>

342
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,110
exactly what we need in politics today

343
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,430
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just mentioned right now is</font>

344
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">exactly what we need in politics today</font>

345
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:03,110
we disagree<font color="#CCCCCC"> on policy um and we disagree</font>

346
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:07,699
on certain things but we're still people

347
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:09,709
who want the best for the country and so

348
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:11,180
we have to hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> one another out</font>

349
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,399
everything is so polarized and I think

350
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,990
that's what leads the kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> violence</font>

351
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,399
that you've seen at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trump rallies</font>

352
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,230
and it also doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> help that Trump</font>

353
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,970
himself promotes violence in certain

354
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">guys and it absolutely agree and it's</font>

355
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:25,370
it's kind of incredible really seeing it

356
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,980
from both sides<font color="#E5E5E5"> where I'll be honest you</font>

357
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,270
talked to some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are anti</font>

358
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,220
Trump and they sound<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly the same as</font>

359
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,900
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are a proton on you know both</font>

360
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">sides</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the spectrum it almost the</font>

361
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:38,150
message gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the you know</font>

362
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,070
there's no real talk of policy it's a

363
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,320
lot of becomes a lot of name-calling it

364
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,540
becomes a lot of chanting and I agree

365
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,940
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I think what ends up fueling a</font>

366
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,710
lot of this anger at<font color="#CCCCCC"> protests so if</font>

367
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,720
really what's happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that anger</font>

368
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,610
has settled into a more reasonable level

369
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,540
of discourse for maybe a you know a

370
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:59,390
softer sort of level of attack yeah I

371
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,490
can't say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a bad thing that's</font>

372
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,770
totally agree if people are safer that's

373
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,900
great there's there's an old saying that

374
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,000
people won't remember what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you say</font>

375
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,500
they'll remember how you made them feel

376
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,870
and I think that's what Trump taps into

377
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,310
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't hear a lot of policy talk all</font>

378
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,230
the time he says things to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> you feel</font>

379
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,240
a certain way and in turn we end up with

380
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,100
people who are very polarized on both

381
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,510
sides because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's riling up their</font>

382
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:24,170
emotions yeah it's it's you know any

383
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">time I've seen any kind of violence take</font>

384
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,850
place you need you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need both sides to be</font>

385
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:31,670
split up and then engage each other so

386
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,050
you know right now we have all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Trump</font>

387
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,040
and edit some people just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

388
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,320
lingering about and everyone's fine and

389
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,760
you'll see him<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking and their call</font>

390
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,100
but if you separate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups and one</font>

391
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,050
person says you know a chant or<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

392
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,910
point everyone gets that feeling again

393
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,190
another being inspired or enraged and

394
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,350
they focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> that on whatever symbol they</font>

395
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,850
can and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my trump hat</font>

396
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,100
someone holding a sign that's when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

397
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,070
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing those clashes heaven sure</font>

398
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:57,950
and so besides<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual protest on the</font>

399
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,180
floor besides the protest outside

400
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,910
there's also been sort of a corporate

401
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,100
protest of Trump where a number of

402
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies which are wells fargo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> UPS</font>

403
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,250
motorola JPMorgan Chase<font color="#E5E5E5"> ford walgreens</font>

404
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,400
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple had sponsored the previous</font>

405
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,320
year's conventions and have not done so

406
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,090
this year<font color="#E5E5E5"> an apple specifically said</font>

407
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,710
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> because of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things Trump has</font>

408
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:22,250
said and I'll be honest looking around I

409
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,570
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> those are huge sponsors but looking</font>

410
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,090
around it doesn't feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the RNC is</font>

411
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,370
lacking in funds to get what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they want</font>

412
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,400
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I almost wonder does that</font>

413
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,740
form of protest work and does protest

414
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,180
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean what is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

415
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">accomplished so I think what it</font>

416
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,590
accomplishes more than anything

417
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,800
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> making sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the reputation of</font>

418
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,930
these companies remains intact because

419
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:48,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone like Donald Trump is so divisive</font>

420
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,600
that you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure you keep your</font>

421
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,310
name clean so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it helps the</font>

422
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">corporations in that regard but it's</font>

423
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,630
also a very courageous<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing for these</font>

424
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">corporations to do because right now</font>

425
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,680
we're living<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> age of legalized</font>

426
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,900
bribery where if corporations want

427
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,120
certain policies to meet their needs

428
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,030
like deregulation for instance they'll

429
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,770
go ahead and fund politicians they'll

430
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,330
sponsor conventions they'll do what they

431
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,830
can to make sure that they're in good

432
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:15,230
terms with these politicians I think

433
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">that these corporations are taking a</font>

434
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,980
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a risk in that if he gets</font>

435
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,350
elected he might hold a grudge against

436
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,180
them I mean Trump is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the type of guy who</font>

437
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,740
definitely wouldn't we definitely would

438
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,870
hold a<font color="#CCCCCC"> grudge yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but with that said</font>

439
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,330
there are plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other corporations</font>

440
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,550
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing to play ball even with</font>

441
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,620
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> as questionable as Trump but I</font>

442
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,600
do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to note that the RNC</font>

443
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,450
specifically asked sheldon adelson who

444
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,000
is a very wealthy man who supports

445
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,150
republican or conservative i should say

446
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,130
politicians they asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> him for six</font>

447
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,690
million dollars to help fund<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

448
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,550
convention and that was a big story last

449
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,530
week so they might have had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a difficult</font>

450
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,330
time coming with the funds or coming up

451
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,800
with the funds they needed a catch up to

452
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,720
it it feels<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a big gamble right if</font>

453
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,330
Trump wins and they're wrong they're on

454
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,130
the wrong side of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Angeles you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

455
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,960
if but if they're right and it seems

456
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that's where they're placing all</font>

457
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,569
their chips that's like you said they

458
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:07,280
don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to damage my reputation in my</font>

459
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,839
opinion though I I look at it more from

460
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,480
what would a why is a business doing

461
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">this I'd imagine no one really cares</font>

462
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,099
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like what's the best for</font>

463
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:18,109
our bottom line okay pull out<font color="#E5E5E5"> or make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

464
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:19,400
a big PR thing about how we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

465
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,050
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's saying exactly there's</font>

466
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,060
definitely a publicity angle to this

467
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,000
there's definitely you know it's like

468
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,060
said it's making a statement about where

469
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,490
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> stand which at this juncture is a</font>

470
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,820
fairly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean we know exactly you know</font>

471
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,830
he's accepting on Thursday we're

472
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,020
basically done like this is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment</font>

473
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,850
where you say you're with<font color="#E5E5E5"> him or you're</font>

474
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">with her you know that's that's kind of</font>

475
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,530
what it's coming down to and I guess I

476
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:48,260
wonder so in if it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> affected their</font>

477
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,620
bottom line that's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing but with</font>

478
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,180
all of these protests

479
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">on going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> without with this massive</font>

480
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,660
anti-trump push he still got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

481
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">nomination it still happened still</font>

482
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,950
happening and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think one of the reasons</font>

483
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,630
why it's happening is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

484
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,190
have been so disillusioned with our

485
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,110
political system that they look at

486
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,720
someone is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Donald as crazy as Donald</font>

487
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,400
Trump<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they don't see the standard</font>

488
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,550
politician and they like it yeah and

489
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,710
they think<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe that's the change we</font>

490
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,660
need for a different country but little

491
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,030
do they know it's gonna lead to pretty

492
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,100
terrible things<font color="#CCCCCC"> well that's but here's</font>

493
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,350
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most alarming argument maybe the</font>

494
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,600
most alarming argument is the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

495
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,880
who say either Bernie Sanders fixes it

496
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,070
or Donald Trump burns it down and that's

497
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">sort of like the Anarch it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

498
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,590
decent<font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of these people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

499
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,510
meet that's all protesting and their

500
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,710
attitude<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if we can't get Bernie</font>

501
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,450
Sanders and we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> vote for Donald</font>

502
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,980
Trump because he's gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it</font>

503
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,570
everything's gone after that right

504
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,160
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely that's definitely a</font>

505
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,620
sentiment I've heard you know a huge I

506
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,390
don't remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it was a majority or</font>

507
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,530
minority but there's definitely a

508
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,930
significant portion of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bernie supporters</font>

509
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,910
who are flatly refusing to vote<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

510
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,250
Hillary and realistically that's one of

511
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,450
two options left that's that's not

512
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,640
voting or voting Trump and in both cases

513
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,460
that's kind of just voting Trump so it's

514
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,530
Bernie Sanders being the spoiler and

515
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,900
this is very real<font color="#E5E5E5"> and very I think</font>

516
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,510
fascinating as a you know in in the way

517
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,890
that this whole election has been going

518
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">well there's also the component of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Gary</font>

519
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">Johnson who's a libertarian candidate</font>

520
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,610
and recent polls indicate that he has

521
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,500
about thirteen percent of the vote and

522
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">that does not bode well for Hillary</font>

523
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,460
Clinton so I'm guessing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

524
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,560
some chunk of Bernie Sanders supporters

525
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,840
that are now you know going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to his camp</font>

526
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,470
to support him which you know sat is

527
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,530
very counterproductive when you consider

528
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,330
libertarian fiscal policy it goes

529
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,190
against everything Bernie Sanders

530
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:39,950
believes so just keep that in mind i I'm

531
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,840
sorry going but if if Gary Johnson hits

532
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,130
fifteen percent he gets in the debate

533
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,110
stage he can split the right in which is

534
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,880
other claims i take the majority yeah

535
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,500
it's true<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

536
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,120
that's what it might come down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISM if</font>

537
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,070
he hits the debates he get you know

538
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,480
he'll he'll work against Trump if he

539
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,130
doesn't he'll work against Hillary and

540
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,200
it's it's honestly been kind of amazing

541
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,290
uh<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost seeing how much Hillary is</font>

542
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:03,680
being slowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> down and how little Donald</font>

543
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">Trump is being slowed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down I mean yeah</font>

544
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,530
uh

545
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:10,400
the outspokenness of the Republican

546
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,530
Party and the and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number of voters</font>

547
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,550
that have just come out to vote for

548
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:16,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">Trump has been such a big middle finger</font>

549
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,710
to the establishment which didn't really

550
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,800
happen on the side of the Democrats that

551
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a kind of interesting split where a</font>

552
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:27,070
you know Trump got his a Bernie didn't

553
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,090
and you know looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the political</font>

554
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:32,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">climate now that's it says a ton about</font>

555
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,500
where I think our country stands on its

556
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,560
future I am I think Trump<font color="#E5E5E5"> just knows how</font>

557
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">to play the game I know so so look I</font>

558
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,070
know it's the RNC so I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been telling</font>

559
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,630
Republicans<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you know we're looking</font>

560
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,860
at these google search terms they have

561
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,590
here in the space yeah and every when

562
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,960
they compared search Donald<font color="#CCCCCC"> Trump and</font>

563
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hillary Clinton Trump has literally</font>

564
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,200
every single state this country be it

565
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,660
positive or negative all people<font color="#CCCCCC"> can talk</font>

566
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:00,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> istana Trump and I think I i</font>

567
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,330
should say when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about who might</font>

568
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,860
win I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of lean towards Trump winning</font>

569
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,020
this November simply because he controls

570
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,270
the media so well and<font color="#E5E5E5"> here i am saying</font>

571
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">his name over and over again it's</font>

572
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:13,610
inescapable stop I think it's I've been

573
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,890
reading some I don't want to necessarily

574
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:19,040
say conspiracy theories but but theories

575
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,740
that everything that he's doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is</font>

576
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,500
extremely calculated you know down to

577
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,300
malia speech you know that they

578
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,340
intentionally pulled the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> lines just</font>

579
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,050
so people would talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it and well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

580
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,130
think stuff like that is a little bit

581
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:34,040
beyond<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pale it's it there does have</font>

582
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,170
to be some truth where Trump is really

583
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,270
really good at getting attention he is I

584
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,610
mean think about the way he came out on

585
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,320
stage during the first night of the

586
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">convention like WWE honey state had a</font>

587
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,960
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> link about that how do you not</font>

588
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,120
talk more doing it now I know it's not I

589
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,790
it was exactly it was i was<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i saw a</font>

590
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,430
Kanye West Show in San Francisco<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

591
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,320
must been a couple years ago he came out

592
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,530
exactly the same way it was and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

593
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,630
thing as Trump did say that last year's

594
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,370
convention was the single most boring

595
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,870
thing he had ever seen this<font color="#E5E5E5"> year he's</font>

596
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:08,480
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring some showbiz so that's</font>

597
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,950
happening that's already you started I

598
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,630
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a professional wrestling</font>

599
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,880
entrance like the silhouette like yeah I

600
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,559
was like

601
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:18,950
like he's a showman you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> no I get</font>

602
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,899
attention when when you're at these

603
00:22:20,899 --> 00:22:23,470
Trump rallies<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I was in Florida and</font>

604
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,519
Trump's late all the time for these

605
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:28,070
rallies his helicopter flies in overhead

606
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,620
a spot light goes on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ummat on the on</font>

607
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,610
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> helicopter and you hear this</font>

608
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:34,879
Imperial<font color="#CCCCCC"> March fanfare Wow and it's this</font>

609
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:36,620
craziest feeling of like watching<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

610
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,509
action movie with a trump helicopter

611
00:22:38,509 --> 00:22:40,159
flying circling over the rally with

612
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,840
everyone's screaming and cheering he

613
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,629
knows how to inspire the feeling of like

614
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:46,549
epic authority and like it's just

615
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:49,940
weirdest thing to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> you yeah I this is</font>

616
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,970
this is a beyond fascinating election

617
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,429
and it really does seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I mean you</font>

618
00:22:55,429 --> 00:22:57,409
know we're talking about protests and I

619
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,570
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that it doesn't feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

620
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:02,360
the protests are working at least and

621
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,059
I'm to be honest I'm very curious to see

622
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:07,490
if Trump does win the presidency which I

623
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:10,669
agree it seems like there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

624
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:13,220
momentum for that to happen even<font color="#E5E5E5"> despite</font>

625
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,049
all the pushback I gotta be honest man I

626
00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:16,580
feel like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of these protests helped</font>

627
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,740
trunk I<font color="#CCCCCC"> well yeah you know I filmed a</font>

628
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,710
clip in in San<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jose where a trump</font>

629
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,299
supporter was just walking forward very

630
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:24,590
calmly and someone whacked him in the

631
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,499
back of the head leaving him bleeding

632
00:23:26,499 --> 00:23:28,960
when you see videos of that when you see

633
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,119
anti-trump protesters it creates you

634
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,559
know makes the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people were in the middle</font>

635
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:35,059
who don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know much just see a</font>

636
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:37,039
group of angry people and their back

637
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">wall Trump jumps right these people are</font>

638
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:42,100
crazy yeah it's kind of similar to

639
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,539
anyone who carries<font color="#E5E5E5"> out any type of act</font>

640
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:46,429
of violence while they're part of any

641
00:23:46,429 --> 00:23:49,070
movement right once you carry out<font color="#E5E5E5"> an act</font>

642
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:51,529
of violence that becomes the media focus

643
00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:54,619
yeah dinosaur the message exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

644
00:23:54,619 --> 00:23:58,059
it I<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally agree and there is very</font>

645
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:00,110
seriously and I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a</font>

646
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:03,080
new thing of the left being seen as the

647
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,450
aggressors which is I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> truly rare</font>

648
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,009
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's all these new terms the</font>

649
00:24:07,009 --> 00:24:08,480
regressive left there's types of

650
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,529
censorship there's all this stuff that's

651
00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:12,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">thrown at the left that you know has</font>

652
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:14,690
kind of been an undercurrent on the

653
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,429
right but it now feels like it's hitting

654
00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:18,529
a mainstream and it's definitely hitting

655
00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:20,179
the mainstream about among Republicans

656
00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:22,159
yes that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge talking point now I</font>

657
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,539
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comment on the whole</font>

658
00:24:23,539 --> 00:24:25,129
regressive Leslie's just a second the

659
00:24:25,129 --> 00:24:26,419
regressive left thing cracks me up

660
00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:28,540
because oftentimes the people who use

661
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:32,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">asset left are literally the most racist</font>

662
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">bigoted individuals imaginable that</font>

663
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,530
despise black people uh that despise any

664
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:41,770
type of equality right and so they they

665
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:44,860
have now taken that word which<font color="#E5E5E5"> liberals</font>

666
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,380
have used against them for decades yeah

667
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,270
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're Dave like reclaimed it as</font>

668
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:52,330
their word against us and so usually

669
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,650
when someone accuses me of being

670
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:55,390
regressive I'll click on their<font color="#CCCCCC"> social</font>

671
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,100
media<font color="#E5E5E5"> account and sure enough they'll</font>

672
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,690
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how black people are animals</font>

673
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,970
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and that so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah this whole</font>

674
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,650
thing about regressive left I don't

675
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,510
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is going mainstream because</font>

676
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:07,150
it's nonsense that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fair yeah I almost</font>

677
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:10,060
mean it in the sense of those tactics

678
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,910
those that sort of attack I like you're

679
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,050
saying gets disconnected from the

680
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:17,230
message and then becomes becomes the

681
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,270
message Ashley yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely happened</font>

682
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,320
the things that aren't being talked

683
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,010
about uh<font color="#E5E5E5"> or nobody's talking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

684
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,570
policy distinctions because Trump

685
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:28,210
doesn't really have a policy instead yes

686
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,650
what's being talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is people</font>

687
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:32,470
attacking Trump and Trump you know

688
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:35,290
saying what<font color="#CCCCCC"> he thinks every I'm sorry</font>

689
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,750
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single speech that you saw last</font>

690
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:41,350
night had nothing to do with policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

691
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,820
nothing to do with substance had

692
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,820
everything to do with tragedy porn had

693
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,250
everything to do with emotional appeal

694
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,190
and that was it in theatrics that's all

695
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,860
I saw bail was there<font color="#CCCCCC"> no is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this gonna</font>

696
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,660
bail yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazed have you seen scott</font>

697
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,310
adams talk about this he's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

698
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,170
dilbert writer yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was a blog about</font>

699
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:00,580
this was saying you know he thinks

700
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,800
Trump's gonna win and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the one of</font>

701
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">the examples is that there's a reason</font>

702
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,520
why Trump is very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> light on policy</font>

703
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,010
and issues so that you can't target him

704
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,900
so that his opponents have nothing to

705
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,670
say against him because he doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

706
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,050
too much about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got stuff</font>

707
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,000
on his website you know you can bug this

708
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,700
stuff but when Trump talks you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

709
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,110
you give the speech it's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> about your</font>

710
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,760
feelings it's all about winning and

711
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,140
being great and deeds like<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

712
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,240
blanket statements I mean you know it's

713
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,220
not too dissimilar to you know Obama

714
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,200
guess we can hope change<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's what</font>

715
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,240
politicians do they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to feel</font>

716
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,680
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then what ends up</font>

717
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,850
happening is these people at these

718
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:36,250
events<font color="#E5E5E5"> for Trump will create in their</font>

719
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,900
own mind what Trump is going to do Oh

720
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,550
Trump's going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things because</font>

721
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,170
I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> in him when Chuck never</font>

722
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:41,700
actually

723
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,960
said those things you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

724
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,309

wait you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit more to see</font>

727
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,720
if his tactics are working if this is

728
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,039
really going to lead to a trump
