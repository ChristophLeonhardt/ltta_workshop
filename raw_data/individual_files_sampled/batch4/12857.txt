yeah I was gonna ask you what's the importance of the me to movement because obviously there's no a lot of focus on hashtag me too and people telling their stories and again it seems like there's a lot of conflation here where people say hashtag me too about I was once catcalled on the subway versus me too as in I was raped by a male relative or something and it's all supposed to be in the same category and then anybody who suggests differently is ripped up and down and I remember which actor suggested recently that there were that there are gradations to severity of Matt Damon Matt Damon Matt Damon said that he was being interviewed I think of ABC News and he said he was he just seemed very nice and he said he cared about the movement and he liked a lot of good men liberal and conservative they are as horrified by it the Harvey Weinstein stories as anyone and he was like he says I care about that I want the movement to succeed however there are degrees of guilt and you know to some proportion in terms of punishment that's appropriate we he said you know patting someone on the ass isn't the same as rape and immediately his former co-star Minnie Driver and this new this angry woman thing you know angry woman on Twitter she starts screeching you know you you know there is a de what are you saying it's all bad he didn't say that it was good we just said there I mean this is fundamental to our legal and moral system that we make you know judgments as serious unless here she said she ruled it out of order and then she said Matt Damon should just you know basically told him to I can't STFU and you know he should shut up and to me this is gonna undo the movement because I do think that we have to bring relations between men and women up to 21st century standards in the workplace there was you know too much going on and making people unhappy but as something men and women should do together not make men the enemy you know we're it's good women and bad men know it's human beings improving the world together and that's what Matt Damon was trying to do and then he came out and said you know I'm just I'm not gonna say anything I know it's just time for me to listen and you know if Matt Damon and he had to do that I think because there was a petition and 30,000 meters were trying to get him erased for next film yeah I mean the same thing happened or something similar happen to Henry Cavill who just suggested look in my personal life I'm a famous guy and when I go out for a date I have to worry about the fact that the person sitting across from me knows I'm rich and famous and so any false accusation could ruin my career and cost me millions of dollars so I'm more likely to go out with an ex-girlfriend but I at least know and trust then to date a new woman and he just got destroyed for it because how dare he suggest something so logical was that right yeah you can't you men are just you know they have to keep quiet well that's not going to help and it's it's it's actually going to ruin the movement
