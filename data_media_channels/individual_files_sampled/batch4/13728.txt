the New York Times a former newspaper ran a story this week celebrating the birthday of Karl Marx the story was entitled happy birthday Karl Marx you were right the writer a South Korean philosophy professor claims that Marx was correct in his assessment that capitalism depends on the ruling classes exploitation of the worker that's why when you look at a country like America which has five times as many billionaires as the Middle East and Africa combined you see so many exploited workers dealing with such terrible problems as obesity and which movie to watch on Netflix or possibly cable whereas when you look at Marxist countries like Venezuela you don't have workers suffering from obesity obesity because eating cats really keeps you slim plus you get a lot of exercise just chasing the little devils around Marx is also correct and saying that if the state owns the means of production it makes it easier to slaughter the people who disagree with you on mass although Marx never actually said that it was just implied in the philosophy finally Marx was absolutely right when he said that the bourgeoisie of capitalism would create their own gravediggers if by gravediggers he meant idiot intellectuals and the people who published them at the New York Times a former newspaper so happy birthday Karl Marx trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show

they're you know when they make themselves look nice I love all that stuff all right left ISM is racism I mean left ISM is racism and this is an important point because they're always picking out ones guy and twisting one guy Trump or any Republican they can get their hands on in twisting his words making it sound like he's racist in some way and of course there are racists on both sides but there's a difference between a philosophy being racist and a person being racist right there's always going to be people who are racist every group there's always going to be people who do bad things under the aegis of a good philosophy you'll have people who in the name of loving your neighbor will go out and you know do something really terrible for Christianity but if the philosophy itself is bad and everybody gets corrupted and that is what leftism is done the problem with leftism is is it is it is an exploded failed philosophy whereas capitalism ugly as it is capitalism has elevated more people and to more wealth than any other philosophy freedom is good for people freedom makes people happy the problem that the elites have with these philosophies is they elevate people that they don't like you know capitalists they're go-getters workers all these people get elevated and get power instead of the elites so the only thing you can do with such a successful philosophy is free-market capitalism and freedom is divide people any way you divide people as you find historical crimes and you say oh we're gonna fix those historical crimes by turning everything around oh you were racist against black people well now we're gonna be racist against white people Oh men we're nasty to women well now women are gonna be nasty you know hooray hooray now we have a lot of nasty women and racist black people and it's great so but the problem is this costs all of us it's not just evil it is evil in itself but of course because when you adopt the evil standards but you know what happens is they think well those white guys are powerful in their races so now we'll be racist and we'll be powerful but of course you just turn into racists you just degrade yourself you degrade everybody with it but the problem is if you look at the world through the lens of race which now is all leftism does everything is about race everything looks they look at everything through the lens and through the filter of race everything gets distorted because racism is stupid racism is evil it's bad stuff and one of the things we are dealing with is we were dealing with the failure of our first black president we had a first black president good for us good for the fact that people would elect it I always knew they would I think they would elect a Jewish president I think that the Americans really just want people who do the job that's all they care about but when it happened I thought well good at least we've got that out of the way unfortunately it made people go it made the left go crazy because they are racist because they look at the world through the filter of race and when Obama came to office and not only was he black but he was the black version of their stupid ignorant philosophy their philosophy of hating America their philosophy of thinking America and capitalism were bad things you can have too much money you can have too much power we've got to share the power it's not right for one country to be lording it over everybody else now their stupid philosophy was dressed up as a black guy and they thought great you know this is and just just to go back for a minute just to remind you of the kind of fog of bliss you know that people CNN and the rest of these bad reporters think we're attacking them because we were standing behind Donald Trump and Donald Trump is attacking them because they don't like him but we're attacking them for what they did under Obama because they abandoned their posts under Obama because they were just so dreamy about it I mean I know that it's not fair to pick on Chris Matthews he's a leftist he's an open leftist but I think he didn't represent how the press felt when Obama was elected just well not just to remind you just cut 14 here's Morning Joe into even-even Joe Scarborough is shocked by the dreamy fog of euphoria and bliss that Chris Matthews ISM I want to do everything I can to make this thing work this new presidency work and I think this presidency was to make this work successfully this country needs a successful presidency and here's Jeff Zeleny who were laughing at yesterday because he was laughing at michelle wolf while she was making jokes those ugly disgusting jokes that she was making and then he went on TV and said oh she went way over the line way over the line but here here he is as the new york times White House correspondent asking the tough questions of the new President Obama during these first 100 days what has surprised you the most about this office enchanted you the most about serving in this office humbled you the most and troubled you the most now let me read this now surprised trouble I've got what was the person surprise fries troubled troubled enchanted enchanted and humble and was Lazlo humble humble thank you sir hard to know how he stood up under those questions and that meant that Obama as Obama began to realize that the press wouldn't touch him on anything he began to abuse his power giving the dreamers you know basically letting them stay even though he'd said like twenty times that that was unconstitutional and his work overseas which is now a problem for all of us has to be judged in the in the light of the fact that the press wants to maintain the press is now in that position that people who do wrong get into you if you've done something wrong whether it's have an abortion or you know be unkind to a friend you then have to say to yourself okay I did something wrong and now I'm going to change now I'm gonna be a different guy and I'm sorry and I feel bad but now I'm gonna move on or you just keep rationalizing and you keep going down that road and that essentially is what the press is doing they're rationalizing their mistake in elevating Obama to as Barbara Walters said well play with Barbara Walters ups thought that he was going to be I shouldn't say this is Christmastime that the next Messiah and the whole Obama care or whatever you want to call that Affordable Health Act it just hasn't worked for him and he's stumbled around on it and people feel very disappointed because they expected more it's very difficult when the expectations for you I'm very high you know I'm much better off when they're low and you and then they rise and rise very high and they drop so now they have to protect because they believed he was the second coming of the Messiah as she says they have to protect that vision they have to protect the fact that they abandoned their posts they abandon their duties they abandon their honor their abandoned journalism for eight long years while Obama failed and led this country down a garden path or they've got to defend his legacy no matter what and that's what we're dealing with with this Iran deal now what should I know what you're saying you're saying why didn't we just hire a president with zipper komm listen we could have hired a present with a dartboard but I err with zip recruiter calm listen you saw my interview with Knowles right you must have said why don't the people at the Daily why're you zip recruiter calm because with zip recruiter they it is a way to get

zip recruiter for free that's right that's free that's pretty inexpensive just go to zip recruiter dot-com slash daily wire zip recruiter comm slash daily wire zip recruiter dot-com slash daily wire and he won't have the chaos and incompetence and insanity that you get at the daily wire because zip recruiter is the smartest way to hire which is kind of a little poem right don't be like the daily wired a zip recruiter is the smartest way to hire yesterday I mean Obama's foreign policy which was based on the idea that America shouldn't be a leader that we should get out of the Middle East that that the Middle East really was an anti is right as rally policy as well was a total total disaster he mishandled Iraq when he pulled out of Iraq too soon let Isis spread didn't do anything about Isis didn't do anything about the Syrian civil war and then said in Syria oh it's okay because the Russians are taking care of it and the Russians have negotiated get rid of all the chemical weapons not so much the chemical weapons are still there remember that was the redline then he made this deal with Iran and this thing I mean the Israelis have been complaining about this forever but I want you to remember the Iran deal Bibi Netanyahu Benjamin not in the came out yesterday with his big production number because Trump has set May 12th as the deadline on whether he's going to pull out of the Iran deal which he has criticized a lot and the Europeans are trying to get him to stay and Netanyahu has hated this thing from the beginning and Netanyahu comes out and he gives this incredible presentation now before I just show you some of this I want you to remember that the deal was based on the idea that they had not been developing nuclear weapons they were supposed to come clean about their program before the deal was in place it was a prerequisite for making the deal so all this talk that you're hearing is that that Netanyahu's presentation didn't change anything is not true this was the assumption was not the assumption the requirement was a per wek whereas it was that Iran is going to be honest so here is Netanyahu playing all the Iranians talking about the fact that they never had a nuclear program in the first place you may well know that Iran's leaders repeatedly deny ever pursuing nuclear weapons you can listen to Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei you can listen to Iran's president Hassan rouhani nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction have no place in Iran security and defense doctrine and contradict our fundamental religious and ethical convictions this is repeated by iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif we didn't have any program to develop nuclear weapons anyway we consider nuclear weapons both irrational as well as immoral well tonight I'm here to tell you one thing Iran lied oh these guys we're still going on television by the way and now there is insulting Netanyahu there's a no he's you know he's just putting on this dog-and-pony show but here's how they got this dog-and-pony show crazy Jews when guys these guys he's got the Israel put the crazy into crazy Jews crazy Jews went into Iran they somewhere they got a mole into Iran and stole their nuclear records they have this here's Netanyahu showing you this little warehouse where they store the nuclear weapons now from the outside this was an innocent-looking compound it looks like a dilapidated warehouse but from the inside it contained Iran's secret atomic archives locked in massive files actually they're a little bigger than this okay a few weeks ago in a great intelligence achievement Israel obtained half a ton of the material inside these vaults and here's what we got 55,000 pages another 55,000 files on 183 CDs great stuff I mean this is he's just doing this to poke the Iranians in the nose man he's just saying because meanwhile Israel is like bombing Syria nobody will admit that it's them but they're obviously fighting all these guys and and by the way a lot of the other players in the Middle East the Saudis they don't want Iran taking over the place either so they're they're kind of standing back so they go in and they steal this stuff we don't know how they got it they obviously had a mole in the operation amazing intelligence achievement the US has looked at all these records says they're real and Netanyahu just comes up with these four conclusions one of which is really important so listen to what he says first Iran lied about never having a nuclear weapons program 100,000 secret files prove that they lied second even after the deal Iran continued to preserve and expand its nuclear weapons know-how for future use why would a terrorist regime hide and meticulously catalog its secret nuclear files if not to use them at a later date third Iran lied again in 2015 when it didn't come clean to the IAEA as required by the nuclear deal and finally the Iran deal the nuclear deal is based on lies it's based on Iranian lies and Iranian deception a hundred thousand files right here prove that they lied so the question that he asks why would they keep all these records if they're not planning to continue to do this that's the big question you know because what what the people who defend this deal keep saying is no no we've got inspections I mean they can't inspect the sites that they were using to build nuclear weapons at the time they don't let them inspect all their military sites and who knows where they've moved their operations you know James Madison v's a good guy you know he came out and he said oh yeah we can we can inspect this stuff we can really look at it it's a very robust program but then I was right why are they keeping these records everything they did was based on a lie and not just their lies Obama's lies as well that is the other thing and that's the thing that the press has to cover up because they don't want to admit that Obama sold them a bill of goods and they said that Ben Rhodes said you know we these guys didn't know anything the press didn't know anything we sold them a bill of goods we created an echo chamber now I just want you to think for a minute about the things that they attack Trump for the two things they attack Trump for is being mean and being dishonest he lies the New York Times says is everyday he lies they used that word lie they never used that about Obama they didn't use it about other presidents but with Trump it's here that he lies and that he's mean now listen you know Barack Obama had more elegance than Donald Trump there's no question about it but listen to the things he did to sell this deal he wanted this deal so badly and a lot of people think he wanted it just because he hated Israel so much the GOP now remember this thing has never been ratified this is not a tract treaty this has never been ratified by by the Senate he didn't take it to the Senate because he knew it would lose the GOP sent a letter saying you know we don't like this deal here is Obama now he doesn't talk like Donald Trump he doesn't have the gruff voice of Donald Trump but listen to what he says about the GOP I think it's somewhat ironic to see some members of Congress wanting to make common cause with the hardliners in Iran it's an unusual coalition I think what we're going to focus on right now is actually seeing whether we can get a deal or now and once we do then we'll if we do then we'll be able to make the case to the American people and I'm confident we'll be able to implement so they made they accuse the Republicans of making common cause with the hardliners in Iran so in other words the Republicans were terrorists now what would happen just imagine if Donald Trump came out and said the Democrats are terrorists that Democrats are just you know everybody would say how nasty that was including me including me but Barack Obama you know used a stiletto instead of a sledgehammer and he slipped in the knife and nobody says anything now the press didn't go after him at all for this then then when Jewish groups started opposing this he went around making speeches and he went on a Jon Stewart Show The Daily Show and he said well we've got to do this instead in in spite of the lobbyists he said this when Chuck Schumer obviously who's Jewish came out and opposed the deal he said you know the guy we got to go around the lobbyists well which lobbyists who was he talking about he was talking about the Jews the Jewish lobby is one of the phrases that anti-semites use to whenever Israel stands up for its owner we're never Jews take on an issue that they think is important to them so suddenly the the lobbyists were the bad that was the key phrase what with the left calls a dog whistle he was anti-semitic he was his the stuff he said about about the Republicans was absolutely absurd and then he lied part of this deal was to release 14 people that who were being held 14 Iranians who were being held and he went on TV and he said we were releasing 14 civilians he said we are releasing 14 civilians and and these of these 14 civilians one of them was a top Hezbollah operative who had not only been indicted in US courts for planning to kill US government employees but whom agents believe reported to Putin is a key supplier of weapons to Syria and Iraq I'm reading this out of the Federalist another was serving an eight-year sentence for conspiring to supply Iran with satellite technology and hardware another was charged with illegally conspiring to procure thousands of parts with nuclear applications so these weren't civilians he lied about that and then did he lie about the money right because remember the Iranians released some hostages including the guy from the Washington Post a reporter named Jason Jason resilient regime and Obama said and then they delivered remember those platters of money and it was all it just was all kind of cash from different places and then Obama said this we do not pay ransom for hostages we've got a number of Americans being held all around the world and I meet with their families and it is heartbreaking and we have stood up an entire section of interagency experts who devote all their time to working with these families to get these Americans out but those families know that we have a policy that we don't pay ransom and the notion that we would somehow start now in this high-profile way and announce it to the world even as we're looking into the faces of other hostage family families who's whose loved ones are being held hostage and and say to them that we don't pay ransom defies logic there their argument was that we owed the Iranians money because we had frozen some of their assets during the hostage crisis and The Hague had said we you owe them this money and we just happened to pay it back at the same time as these people were released it just happened but they did say they did say that the release of the people the State Department said the release of the people contingent on this the delivery of this money that's a ransom that is a ransom when you pay money to somebody when a release of hostages is contingent on a payment that's a ransom so whatever but an Obama's emotionless to peel there was just dishonest the whole thing was dishonest and we didn't get anything Iran was already a signatory of the non-proliferation agreement they weren't supposed to Queen but they were doing in the first place so we didn't get anything and what we did do is we took the sanctions off we'll never get those sanctions back on them again we'll never get the Europeans in line to put those sanctions back on them again and it was a disaster so you can say well don't pull out of the deal because it's gonna be even worse but that's like saying you know you gave in to the Mafia but if you pull out of the Mafia the Mafia's gonna come and burn your restaurant you know that's not really doesn't make it a good deal and I just want to show you I have to show you the press protecting Obama's legacy in this crappy deal that he sold us through lies he sold it through lies and Iran sold it through lies yeah I got you've got to see this Chris Cuomo it has Netanyahu Netanyahu now makes the rounds after his big dog-and-pony show he makes the rounds of the new shows Chris Cuomo this goes for the moral equivalence of Iran having weapons secret wet a secret nuclear plan and Israel a free country whether they have weapons on listen to this interview be an open question and it has very lethal implications that's something that we'll have to see how it develops the idea of disclosure Iran won't tell the truth we had to go in there you know is Israel's position and steal this information so we can know the truth disclosure as an issue should work every way the United States should say what it has you know where I'm going with this a yes/no question for you does Israel have nuclear capabilities and nuclear weapons yes or no we've always said that we won't be the first to introduce it so we haven't introduced but that's not an answer to the questions what will happen or do you not have any country it's as good an answer is you're gonna get but I'll tell you one thing Chris and I think it's important you know Iran signed NPT Iran signed all sorts of committing Iran said that they don't have this nuclear weapons program and Iran calls daily for the annihilation of my country absolutely don't do that we understand that there's an existential threat from Iran and others we understand that Iran is known for lying on this issue that's one of the big motivating factors for the deal in 20 2015 as it was explained to us but what I'm saying is if the disclosure matters so much what message does it send when you won't confirm something that is widely believed by the entire international I'm sorry but you watch Cuomo and it's like he's making a moral equivalence between Israel our ally of Free State who threatens nobody and Iran who has continually called for Israel to be wiped off the map and there's somehow somehow because or he calls for Iran to put forward their nuclear plans Israel should put forth you know and and Chuck Todd did exactly the same thing he was interviewing US senator who do fraud month I think it was and he says he says well we can deal with you know North Korea why are we being so nice to North I mean it's insane listen to this sometimes it's weird how we're treating Kim jong-un versus how we treat the Iranians Kim jong-un essentially murdered an American citizen in Otto wong beer it's very possible the way he was treated over there he's essentially murdered plus probably his own brother murdered other people he has starved his own people the Iranians don't starve their own people i it is you know and yet we're we're sort of now feeling comfortable closing up with Kim jong-un and demonizing the Iranian it just feels like we're sending some odd messages around the world well I don't know Chuck I think you want to be sure you learn the lesson of North Korea which is don't let countries that have bad inclinations all over the world wind up with nuclear weapons we we're with no we were Iran right now where we would have been with North Korea 15 years ago and it's foolish to let Iran become another North Korea and we're not dealing with Kim Jong Young because we think he's a good guy I can handle things I'm smart like everybody says they're all Fredo their entire news our entire journalistic the entire American journalist a community they're all Fredo Fredo runs from one station to another dressing up as different newsmen they are just protecting Obama's legacy why because lept ism is racism because they elevated Obama above what he was and above what he could do above his record before he took office and his record after he took office and now they're trying to protect themselves from the absolutely true charge that they blew their profession for eight years and now have lost the respect of the people and you know this this thing is a dangerous deal this thing with Iran is a dangerous deal and to protect it in order to protect the press's reputation is absurd all right we've got the Kyl man of the Babylon being coming up but you got to come on over to the Daily wire calm because we have to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube come to the daily why calm subscribe ask your questions on the last mailbag before the clayvin this week begins kyle man is the editor-in-chief of the Babylon be one of my favorite sites it's got more than 300,000 Facebook fans and over 70,000 visitors to the website daily he is also the co-author of how to be a perfect Christian your comprehensive guide to flawless spiritual living so if some of you out there feel that you are not yet perfect as Christians this interview this interview and this book will tell you how here it is so Kyle thank you for coming on I appreciate it now I think your book is destined to become a Christian classic how to be a perfect Christian you know some people say that a perfection is beyond us because mankind is sinful and helpless without God I find that kind of a downer am I wrong no you're not wrong those people are very wrong because you can achieve total perfection I mean I literally wrote the book on it so yeah I don't know what those people are talking about but if you try really hard and you conform to the standards of Christian culture and evangelicalism you too can be perfect that's the message we want to get out with this book I think that that's a very important Christian message to send around I mean I when I look for a church I want I want to church the centers just worship around me I mean I think that like I want to be at the center of my Christian worship bath how do i how do I go about finding that kind of church well you have to find a church first of all that looks like a shopping uh-huh that's your first that's your first goal so if you drive around town you look for a church has tens of thousands of parking spaces it has to have a coffee shop gift shop bookstore fitness center football field roller coasters everything everything that you would want basically it should look like Disneyland yeah steeple is kind of a deal-breaker right yeah steeple crosses this any kind of indication that they might not they might not support you in your path to conforming to Christian culture would be would be a turn-off yeah very I get that I get that I think I can find I'm in LA so there's plenty of churches like that around I you know also I you know I worry about the past or you go out and you look for a church you kind of walk in the guy starts telling you about sin or about Hell and I you know I just find that you know it's it's so off-putting I you know I mean that is not I want Christianity to to basically lift me up and make me feel better about myself yeah you know in our book how to be a perfect Christian we have a list of trigger words that should be rewarding for you kind of an indication that the church is not right for you and and some of those are like hell wrath cross Jesus you know anything that would make you feel uncomfortable in the sermon is definitely a red flag yeah whenever whenever I hear them talking about the cross I always think like you know that that doesn't sound pleasant at all I mean that really sounds like that could cause a lot of suffering and I don't know why why you would want to do that yeah I mean y-you know we're trying to grow these churches to get tens of thousands of people and how are you gonna do that when you're talking about death and execution and blood you know I was in a church the other weekend and they were singing a song about the blood of Jesus I mean that's just disgusting why why would we want to sing about that really unpleasant really ugly now another thing that I find happens sometimes in church and I you know this may just be one of those things that's a holdover from another day as sometimes I ask you to turn to the person next to you and shake his hand and or even say even make some comment to somebody you don't even know I mean I just find you know how can you avoid I want I want to be a perfect Christian I want everybody to know that I'm a perfect Christian I mean that's the important thing is that everyone knows it but how do I do that without getting over involved with other people in my true yeah you need to be really careful because people who aren't less holy than you which is everybody let's be frank they're gonna rub off on you if you let that negativity into your life so when the pastor says or the worship leader says you know let's greet one another you just need to stare straight ahead arms folded in front of you just glaring your people come up when say hey good morning you just just Stonewall them worst-case-scenario bring a smoke grenade na along that's it I hadn't phoned about its with smoke grenade uh-huh grappling hook you know grappling hook yourself right out of there you're good and you know I mean I think you also have these small groups where people start to like latch on to you you know they start to follow you around ask you for advice I own their Christian Christian journey they start talking about that you know how do you get out of that well we do recommend joining a small group because you can't really appear holy unless you're part of one of these small groups community groups connection groups whatever they call them so you do have to you do have to join one but the idea would be to kind of keep them at arm's distance and you don't want them to think that you're starting to depend on them so when you show up you maybe maybe show up once a month if it's a weekly thing you know every third or fourth time you show up and just kind of grace them with your presence when you when you do show up to your small group you want to you want to examine the house of the person who's hosting it so you want to go look at their shelf and see if they have any Game of Thrones DVDs you know so you can pull it out and show everybody hey these people aren't up to my standards and holiness now you can look in the garage they probably they're probably hidden any beer or wine you know up on a high shelf in the garage so you could look for that take some pictures show it to the pastor so you know small groups can be a really good way to catapult yourself to the next level of spiritual perfection yeah Game of Thrones is great for that I mean really does when you can condemn Game of Thrones especially if they have you know any kind of recordings at home that that you can get so we're talking about how to be a perfect Christian you'll see there's yellow on the cover just like some of CS Lewis's books which it really reminds me of you know they're one of my my favorite parts of the Gospels they come to Jesus and they say yeah you know how do you pray how do you pray when you pray you need to you need to sound like a Puritan so go read a bunch of the you know 17th century 16th century Puritans reformers grab all of their big words that you don't understand and just sprinkle them throughout your to prayer even if you don't know what they mean you don't understand what you're saying everyone around you will think wow that guy I said you know mortification and and they'll immediately know that you are a perfect Christian that's that's great so their words like mortification anything with more than you know one or two syllables I think probably carry you forward a couple of these and thousands that is that all right - yeah yeah use these in the house yeah yeah sprinkle liberally throughout so now some of the some of the churches I've been to you know have they call them volunteer opportunities or outreach opportunities how do I avoid those I you know I feel I feel that you know I want to be I want to be a perfect Christian but I don't want to get too close to people who are smelly or dirty or poor anything like that so how do I avoid get out of these volunteer outreach things yeah so if the pastor approaches you and he says hey we really need help serving in the two and three-year-olds ministry or we need help at the homeless ministry obviously those positions aren't going to get a lot of praise they're not going to get a lot of glory so you just tell the pastor I'm gonna keep that in prayer I'm gonna keep that in prayer and then I know okay yeah I'm gonna keep that in prayer you know even he's just like hey all I'm asking is for you to watch the kids for an hour next week yeah I really need to think on this I need to pray on this and then just never get back to it that's that's that sounds really use that's really useful advice I appreciate you know one of the things I took away one of the lessons I took away from how to be a perfect Christian is that being a perfect Christian depends a lot on your online presence I mean how you present yourself to other people online can you give me some tips on what would make me a more perfect Christian or at least appear to be a more perfect Christian online well you start with the profile picture so we we have a there's a few different options that you could take that you could choose to for your profile picture you know a picture of one of the reformers you know just a serious dour looking John Calvin or Martin Luther that's a good way to go Jesus may be wearing a make America great again hat riding riding on an eagle firing an ar-15 that that's a good that's a good way to go to that's kind of the political rabbit you know you could kind of choose you can customize it to your own your own feel but that and then everything you post just needs to be a inspirational quote you know like we said we don't want negativity rubbing off on people's is just inspirational quote after inspirational quote share a lot of those images of of the Caucasian Jesus you know that says one amen you know or one like equals one amen a one share equals one salvation or whatever share a lot of those do that shows Jesus that you love them it shows everyone else that you love Jesus we also recommend taking a picture of your devotional time in the mornings you know even if you don't actually have time to read the Bible just at least make time to open it up put the coffee and take the picture yeah yeah yeah that is something I mean I don't really have time to read the bio you know I'm just busy you know it's like and and nobody no-nobody but but you really help out with that in how to be a perfect Christian you help out with that by giving distilling the essential truths of the gospel so you don't have to actually go to the gospel and find those out and you give me a couple of those the essential truths of what the gospel is basically telling us so the essential truths of the Christian faith well first of all we give kind of a systematic theology so we can we explain you know the eternal truths of the gospel you know who God is and who Jesus is and the Holy Spirit you know and how he kind of gives you Jedi powers all of that stuff that's kind of the important essentials of the faith and then we go into kind of the spirit of Christian doctrine which is you are amazing so I think we give six or seven in there that are the the core tenets but they can all pretty much be summed up in the fact that you are amazing and you are special and anything else thing but he says about you even if the Bible says it is just more negativity in your your life so you need to cut that out that that's exactly where that's the kind of perfection of Christianity I'm looking for I am looking for a church a pastor a Bible that tells me that I'm I'm great you know cuz why would I what else do I want you know I mean life is short you know Jesus calls us to be cultural warriors in the Bible in the passage where he says you know go forth and be a cultural warrior Saye but I'm not quoting exactly but it's something like that what you know what does that mean what does it look like to be a cultural warrior for Christianity well it's definitely not just living out the gospel in your day-to-day life loving your neighbors doing things that show them the love of Christ sharing the gospel that is not the way to win the culture more the number one thing you need to do is become a registered Republican obviously important vote for any vote for any Republican candidate you know no matter if they're good the issue is bad on the issue is good voting record bad or voting record good character doesn't matter when you get to heaven they're gonna ask to see the records about everybody you voted for and you want to have voted a straight Republican ticket each and every time so that's a good starting place and that's what Jesus taught us yeah yeah and and I mean I find you know you have in this a an actual holiness progress tracker it takes you from Satan to Jesus so that when you start the book you're probably down there around Satan close to Judas and then you can move up through Kane and David in the Apostle Paul finally get as far as Jesus when you're a perfect Christian you know finally let let me wrap this up when you're when you're a cultural warrior I mean part of the most important part of being a cultural war is condemning people who don't see things the way you are I mean this is strict biblical gospel admonition to condemn others where do I start how do I start with when I'm condemning me oh I made anyone and everyone I would definitely condemn you know your your immediate family first you know and then you just move you move to the concentric circles of your of your costs and your your your influence groups after that so yeah you need to condemn anybody who doesn't see things exactly the way that you do I mean they're pretty much Hitler anyway so right they don't really count in terms of loving your neighbor you're supposed to you're supposed to condemn them shake the dust off your sandals and move on yeah I mean I you know it it just stands to reason that if you are a perfect Christian anybody who is not you is obviously imperfect and therefore you know really close to Hitler the the from the Babylon be how to be a perfect Christian I know it's gonna be on my shelf next to you know where I would put my Bible if I had one or you know even next to it and it's the works of CS Lewis the only other writer on these subjects that I know anything about thank you very much Cobb for coming on and I hope I hope the book you know sells to as many people as possible because we're here to make money yeah thanks a lot thank you so ever every

and the celebrity causes them to have the feeling that they know the woman so they'd actually rather watch a famous woman take her clothes off then an obscure woman take her clothes off because they
