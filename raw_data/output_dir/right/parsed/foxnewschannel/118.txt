STEVE, DOWN TO YOU.
STEVE: THANKS, CARLEY.
OH CANADA IS SAYING O
CANNABIS.
OUR NEIGHBORS TO THE NORTH
LEGALIZING RECREATIONAL
MARIJUANA.
CANADIENS THE LARGEST NATION
IN THE WORLD TO DO IT.
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES
JUST NINE STATES ALLOW IT.
WITH THE MIDTERMS AROUND THE
CORNER, THIS IS A MAJOR
ISSUE ON THE BALLOT IN
MICHIGAN AND NORTH DAKOTA.
SO, IS NATIONWIDE POT
LEGALIZATION IN AMERICA'S
FUTURE AS WELL?
JOINING US RIGHT NOW ARE
FORMER POLICE OFFICER JOE
PETERS WHO SERVED NUT WHITE
HOUSE DRUG CZAR'S OFFICE
SCREEN LEFT.
AND MICHAEL, THE CHAIRMAN OF
THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE.
GUYS, GOOD MORNING TO YOU.
>> GOOD MORNING TO YOU,
STEVE.
>> GOOD MORNING.
STEVE: BIG QUESTION, IS IT A
GOOD IDEA?
JOE, I WILL START WITH YOU,
TO LEGALIZE POT NATIONWIDE
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES?
CANADA JUST DID IT?
>> QUICK ANSWER IS NO.
I THINK WE WILL BE SORRY.
FORTUNATELY WE HAVE A
CRYSTAL BALL IN THIS CASE
BECAUSE WE CAN LOOK FIVE
YEARS LATER AT WHAT HAPPENED
IN COLORADO, FOR INSTANCE,
WHICH LEGALIZED MARIJUANA.
STEVE: WHAT HAPPENED IN
COLORADO?
>> BY EVERY METRIC IT WAS A
FAILURE IN MY VIEW.
TEEN DRUG USE IS THE HIGHEST
IN THE COUNTRY:  TEEN DRUG
USE.
DRUG DRIVING IS OFF THE
CHARTS.
DOUBLED WITH MARIJUANA
IMPAIRED DRIVING.
HOMELESSNESS IS UP.
EMERGENCY ROOM ADMISSIONS.
AND THE BLACK MARKET IS
FLOURISHING.
BLACK MARKET ARREST REMEMBER
THE WHOLE NOTION IS WE
LEGALIZE IT WE CAN CONTROL
IT BLACK MARKET ARRESTS ARE
UP ALMOST 400 PERCENT.
STEVE: MICHAEL, YOU ARE
PROPONENT OF IT, TIRKLY
MEDICAL MARIJUANA AND THINGS
THAT HELP YOU FEEL GOOD.
>> YES.
STEVE: YOU HEARD WHAT HE
JUST SAID.
>> YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE THAT
IT HAS TO BE REGULATED AND
HAVING MEDICAL MARIJUANA
BEING VERY HELPFUL
NATIONALLY AND
INTERNATIONALLY.
WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN
SOUTH AMERICA FOR EPILEPSY
AND PARKISON'S AND WE SHOW A
LOT OF BENEFITS.
STEVE: MOST PEOPLE ARE FOR
MEDICAL MARIJUANA.
IT'S WHEN IT'S RECREATIONAL
THERE IS A POLL OUT SHOULD
MARIJUANA RECREATIONAL BE
LEGAL?
THIS WAS A PEW POLL.
62% SAY YES.
MAKE IT LEGAL.
34% SAY NO.
IT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL.
>> I THINK ULTIMATELY IT
WILL BE LEGAL.
BUT, AGAIN, IF IT'S
REGULATED PROPERLY SO PEOPLE
GET THE RIGHT PRODUCT.
YOU DON'T WANT MARIJUANA
LACED WITH FENTANYL AND SOME
OF THESE OTHER ISSUES.
STEVE: ABSOLUTELY.
>> THAT'S ONE WAY.
>> THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
WE ARE IN THE THROW HE IS OF
AN OPIOID CRISIS.
PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST BOLDLY
MOVED FORWARD WITH AN ENTIRE
NEW AGENDA FOCUSING ON
TREATMENT AND PRESCRIPTION
OF LEGAL OPIOIDS BECAUSE IT
LEADS TO ADDICTION.
WHY ON EARTH WOULD WE
INTRODUCE RECREATIONALLY A
BRAND NEW DRUG AND OPEN THE
FLOOD GATES, PARTICULARLY TO
YOUNG PEOPLE, AND BIG
TOBACCO WILL TAKE OVER, BIG
MARIJUANA WILL BE WHAT BIG
TOBACCO IS TODAY.
STEVE: I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW
MANY TIMES WE HAVE DONE
SEGMENTS ON POT AND PEOPLE
RIGHT IN AND SAY DRINKING IS
LEGAL.
IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN
DRINKING, IS IT?
>> WELL, DEFINITELY IT
DIFFERENT.
AGAIN, REGULATING
RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA, YOU
KNOW, JOE MENTIONED, YOU
KNOW, ISSUES AS IT RELATES
TO OPIOIDS.
RIGHT?
OUR BIG PUSH IN OUR COMPANY
IS CBD AS OPPOSED TO PUTTING
PEOPLE ON OPIOIDS.
IF YOU CAN MOVE PEOPLE
AGAINST RECREATIONAL MORE
TOWARDS THE CBD SIDE WHERE
YOU ARE NOT GETTING HIGH
THAT WOULD BE A PLUS.
