Crump has canceled the summit with North Korea this news is breaking as I record you this segment this morning president Donald Trump has canceled a singapore-based summit with North Korean leader Kim jong-un because of of Kim's recent nasty and horrible rhetoric the meeting would have marked the first face-to-face encounter between a sitting US president and North Korea a North Korean leader and it was said of course for June 12th just a couple of weeks from now let me read you the letter that the White House bent early today to North Korea addressed to his Excellency Kim jong-un Jem chairman of the state affairs Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea Pyongyang dear mr. chairman we greatly appreciate your time patience and effort with respect to our recent negotiations and discussions relative to a summit long sought by both parties which was scheduled to take place on June 12th in Singapore we were informed that the meeting was requested by North Korea but that to us is totally irrelevant I was very much looking forward to being there with you this is where Trump becomes Trump and this is why America's strong in the world is safer words from the president sadly based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement I feel it is inappropriate at this time to have this long planned meeting therefore please let this letter serve to represent that the singer poor summit were the good of both parties but the detriment of the world will not take place now this is where Trump is really Trump and I could not be prouder of our president at this moment you talk about your nuclear capabilities but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used I felt the wonderful dialogue was building up between you and me and ultimately it is only that dialogue that matters someday I look very much forward to meeting you in the meantime I want to thank you for the release of the hostages who are now home with their families that was a beautiful gesture and very much appreciated from just sticking it to him if you change your mind having to do with this most important summit please do not hesitate to call or write me the world and North Korea in particular has lost a great opportunity for lasting peace and great prosperity and wealth this missed opportunity is is a truly bad moment in history MC Lee yours Donald J Trump President of the United States of America now this all comes on the heels of Kim I'm gonna find you the quote here him insulting vice president Mike Pence yah was was he said that the vice president stupid and he was politically stupid and Trump had no choice at the cancel the meeting Kim said the Kim spokesman go son we said the North would not beg for dialogue and warned of a nuclear showdown if diplomacy failed North Korean says it will not give up its me up and unilaterally unilaterally now Chosun hoy is uh been involved in the woman involved in these thumb talks are quite a while and a North Koreans are really asking for it they're really asking they are now prodding the United States but they never banked on Trump they never banked on a guy like Donald Trump who was actually going to call their bluff Obama would have gone to the summit if Obama had gotten the stomach if he had gotten that summit to take place and Kim jong-eun via a spokeswoman Chosun who had insulted Joe Biden called him stupid and had ranted and raved this is all over my pen saying that the Libya model wouldn't apply to North Korea if North Korea played ball in other words there wouldn't be regime change if North Korea played ball hence warm that North Korea may end like Libya meaning him could be deposed and carried out into the streets and murdered in public in his body torn apart Gaddafi died a horrible death but he Trump is not Obama so this is what Joe bad the spokeswoman for North Korea he added quote as a person involved in US affairs I cannot suppress my surprise at such ignorant and stupid remarks gushing from the mouth of the u.s. vice president whether the US will meet us at a meeting room or encounter whether the US will meet us at a meeting room or encounter us at nuclear to nuclear showdown is entirely dependent upon the decision and the behavior of the United States now North Korea is playing the wrong game with the wrong guy they are playing the wrong game with the wrong guy now let's go back through trump's letter knowing all that he said to Kim you talk about your nuclear capabilities but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used meaning if you dare try to launch a nuke first we have missile defenses that could take out Kim's nuke from will level he will level North Korea he also says the North has missed North Korea in particular has lost a great opportunity for lasting peace and great prosperity and wealth he's telling North Korea we will annihilate you if you even think about using a nuclear weapon you will cease to exist and now we are going to put pressure on China on South Korea on Japan who choked you economically we are going you're broke I read you North Korea's GDP last week it's only something like twelve point four billion dollars compared to the u.s. is 1718 trillion dollar GDP Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates can buy and sell Amazon buy and sell North Korea rather Bezos amazon.com and and Bill Gates Microsoft think well they could the men could personally buy and sell North Korea a couple of times over and there is absolutely nothing Kim can do he has a few nuclear weapons China's gonna squeeze him now South Korea is gonna squeeze them Japan's in the mix I expect we're gonna put tremendous pressure on Russia North Korea made a very very serious miscalculation here very very serious miscalculation and this story as I said as a as I'm bringing this to you it's just breaking and so I want to there's not much on this now North Korea was claiming they demolished a nuclear site ahead of the summit they claimed this from The Associated Press as just weeks ahead of a planned summit with US President Donald Trump Kim jong-un made good on his promise to demolish North Korea's nuclear test site which was formally closed in a series of huge explosions Thursday as a group of foreign journalists looked on the explosions of the nuclear test site deep in the mountains of North Korea's sparsely populated northeast was centered on three tunnels at the underground site and a number of buildings in the surrounding area they held a closing ceremony North Korea state their state media called the destruction of the site quote a nuclear-free the process to build a quoted nuclear free peaceful world and quote global nuclear disarmament and they went on to say the dismantling of the nuclear test ground conducted with high-level transparency as clearly attested once again the proactive in peace-loving efforts of the DPRK government Democratic People's Republic of Korea being made for assuring peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and all over the world but apparently they weren't serious because they decided to attack our vice president now you can like a politician you can dislike a politician you can love Trump you can hate Trump you can love pence you can hate pence but an American respects the office I despise Barack Obama but I wouldn't stand for attacks on the office of the presidency I thought Joe Biden was a buffoon a moron but I wouldn't stand for attacks on the office of the vice president by a foreign enemy by a foreign enemy I thought Obama was a doormat I was offended that Obama allowed his presidency to be trampled on by bad guys I didn't think Obama was a fan of American exceptionalism I thought it made the world very unsafe in America very weak but I don't want kim jeong-hoon calling our vice president idiot on the world stage stupid well it worked via his spokeswoman I don't want that and us going to a summit I think the president did exactly the right thing canceling this summit I love that he cancelled it after the statements I love that he canceled it after we got the hostages back and I loved it he told North Korea yeah you want a saber rattling nukes we're gonna have some problems we're gonna have a lot of problems and I believe that Donald Trump will take action now this has certainly made the likelihood of some kind of military action more likely it certainly has yeah you know if it we were deluding ourselves to believe it has it do I think we're going to war with North Korea no I don't now the stock market's being affected docks are slipping a bit as trumple's out of the North Korea summit but that was to be expected right I mean we didn't expect the stock markets to rally on on claims of on news that we're exiting the summit we also found out that one of the ways Kim jong-un and his top advisors in her circle we're preparing a meet with Donald Trump were by reading that's a ridiculous book fire and fury that book that's been basically debunked and that to me is is actually pretty sad that that's the extent of North Korea's intelligence that they read gossip books big news gossip it's actually really kind of pathetic and so but I don't expect any more from nation like North Korea now from Fox Business they're saying stocks fell off a bit the sp500 as it reaches down about 13 percent Dow Jones averages yes P 500 at 13 points a net change I'm sorry there it's down 13 it's down 13 out there new and Jesus devastating ah down about half a percent Dow Jones averages are down about point seven percent point six nine as I read that and then adds that composite down about point B six so not massive sweeping losses but a typical market correction with news like and that that can certainly change by the time you watch this video later today but I not predict you not predict that we are going to see anything change with regards through the summit do not predict that whatsoever I'm glad we have a strong president the world is a dangerous place and we were beaten up we were browbeating by Barack Obama for so long we were treated like the doormats of the world and there's more news I keep you know as I keep glancing at the screen news items are popping up as I talk to you about this so is nor even Marco Rubio is saying that North Korea solution is in China's interest as well I rarely agree with Marco Rubio on this one do but he our kirby is right finding a solution with North Korea would benefit China as well it's in China's best interest impression North Korean I don't have to remember about back about um well it's gotta be back about ten to twelve years now could be leaving a little longer then President George W Bush was caught on a hot mic at a summit it was one of the G summits g8 or g20 or something like that talking to British Prime Minister then Prime Minister Tony Blair but we're going back well over a decade and plus he was caught on a hot mic saying that China has to tell North Korea to stop the s-stop the nonsense basically with an expletive and that's the way you control North Korea and China has always been the key to controlling North Korea but so is a strong US and we've never had a Donald Trump this letter is it's absolutely outstanding I like what what what Trump is doing here and this woman Chosun Horry oh I talked about a little earlier she's a top Korean official she's a spokeswoman or Kim's administration his dictatorship really she her insults to our vice president well it just couldn't go on answer and John Bolton you know look we've got a foreign policy 18 I say it every day a plus plus plus plus team in Donald Trump Mike Pompeo John bolt and some other people on the National Security Council mmm general mattis over at defense now Jeana hospital at CIA look I don't like her relationship with Brennan but she knows how to handle bad guys in the world and it appears Donald Trump has become much smarter about who he can trust and who he can't after this Muller thing I don't think he'd of appointed G in a hospital unless he felt they could trust her that she wasn't gonna work against him we don't know what private conversations they have we don't know if she walked into the Oval Office and said my god I'm so glad to be rid of Brennan what a disaster that guy was but I kept my mouth shut because I had to work under the guy we don't know that that didn't take place part of me suspects something like that probably did for Donald Trump to appoint her I know that Mike Pompeo and Trump have always been they've always seen eye to eye but I like that we pulled out of this summit look I was encouraged when it was going down but I wanted the summit to happen only if the United States walked into that meeting in Singapore in a position of power that's why I never wanted it on the DMZ I never wanted it on the North Korean side of the DMZ demilitarized zone I never wanted it anywhere near that area I didn't like us going to Kim's home field no Singapore was always a good location neutral both teams on an equal playing field the United States obviously far more powerful militarily economically I mean dramatically more like I said twelve point four billion in GDP for North Korea 17.8 almost eighteen trillion for the United States according to the most recent numbers and militarily it's not even a contest not even a contest and I think we now have to take an even harder line on North Korea let them know that if they open their mouths they're going to face the full wrath of the United States if they want to see they want to read that book fire and fury to learn how to deal with Donald Trump well in a completely different context Donald Trump should now show North Korea fire and fury unless they get in line apologized and begged to be brought back to the table it's very important content and I want to bring
