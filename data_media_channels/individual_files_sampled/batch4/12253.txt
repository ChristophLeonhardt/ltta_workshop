yesterday after we finished this podcast Anthony Kennedy stepped down and blew up the world so I was not expecting Justice Anthony Kennedy to step down from his position on the Supreme Court and the fact is that I think most people were hit by a truck over this way most people in the Trump administration were very surprised by this and maybe President Trump was not because maybe be having discussions with Justice Kennedy but there are a lot of people who are very surprised by Justice Kennedy stepping down specifically because most of his legacy is going to be the gay rights stuff right he was the lead writer in in obergefell which was the case that suggested that same-sex marriage had to be the law of land he was socially liberal on issues like abortion but he stepped down while Trump was president and there was a Republican Congress and that cut against a lot of the conventional wisdom I for example thought that he was going to stick it out until there was a Democrat who was presidents that his legacy would be maintained but instead he decided to step down the reason I think he decided to step down besides the fact that he's 81 years old is because I think that he looked at the spate of rulings that the Supreme Court has issued over the last three weeks and what he saw was that there are four votes to overturn a lot of First Amendment protections there been three major cases in the last couple of weeks in which five to four the Supreme Court had decided in favor of free speech but if he were to be replaced by somebody from the left then the left would immediately curtail the right to free speech so for example there was a case that I discussed at length yesterday on the podcast this case in which the Supreme Court decided that you could not be forced to pay into a union for which you did not vote and Anthony Kennedy was on the majority side of that opinion he said that that was violation of the First Amendment well there are four votes to say that the government can force you to pay money to an association like the Union that you don't want to pay into alright Anthony Kennedy probably looked at that he said I'm not sure that I want to leave one of Democrats in office because then there'll be five votes in favor of the proposition that the government can force you to pay money to an association that you don't like and then there was a case that came down in the last couple of weeks in which for example it said that mastered the masterpiece cake shop case where it said that if you are a religious Baker you do not have to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding but only this was decided on narrow grounds only because the regulation in question was badly promulgated by the Colorado Civil Rights Commission there are four votes in that case to basically suggest that any religious Baker in the country can be forced at point of government done to cater a same-sex wedding and Anthony Kennedy even though he's a gay rights advocate might not be the kind of guy who wants the government to force people to do what they don't want to do at point of gun until you figured okay if I stepped down with a Democrat as president then there will be five votes for the proposition that the government can force any religious person in the country to violate his or her prescriptions when it comes to business so I think Anthony Kennedy looked at the radical left of the court he said I don't want my legacy to be the radical left of the court I'd rather rather than my legacy be the gay rights legacy my guess is that he wants to Chief Justice Roberts and he got a guarantee from him the Roberts would become the new swing vote if same-sex marriage were to come back up for reconsideration and Roberts will work to to tamp that down that the same-sex marriage stuff will stay enshrined in law and his legacy will be enshrined and he'll be fine and he will be able to step down from the court and be replaced by somebody who is more in line with his thinking on First Amendment issues now all of that is speculation but that is my strong inclination is that that's what happened here in any case the Kennedy steps down and that of course opens up a slot on the Supreme Court and a swing vote on the Supreme Court because Kennedy has been the swing vote Kennedy has been the guy who makes the decisions in these five four cases he's been the most powerful guy in the country for a long time and that is a testament to the fact that the Supreme Court has become far too powerful in American life you saw an enormous amount of gnashing of teeth and wailing and rending of garments from the left and tremendous excitement from the right at the fact that this seat is now open on the Supreme Court and Trump is going to get to fill it and the reason for that is that the Supreme Court has become entirely too powerful in the structure of American government if you go back and you look at the Federalist Papers we go through them every week here on the bench Shapiro show when you go back and you look through the Federalist Papers what you see is that they thought that the judiciary was going to be a relatively powerless arm of the government that its job was basically going to be to sit there and say this is constitutional and this is not but not on the grounds they don't like a piece of legislation in fact the Federal Constitution didn't even apply to the States so the federal courts and the Supreme Court in particular we're supposed to be relatively toothless now the Supreme Court gets to decide whether everyone in the country is able to obtain an abortion there is able to kill babies the Supreme Court gets to decide whether anyone in the country is able to get married to anybody else the Supreme Court has entirely too much power and that is reflected in all of the focus on the Supreme Court that's because the left has taken the Supreme Court and used it as a tool in order to promulgate its agenda the Left sees this prim Court as its chief tool in pushing legislation to get can't it can't get passed through popular means the reality is the left was pushing same-sex marriage for example for years and years and they weren't getting anyplace with regard to federal legislation so they went to the courts and the courts gave them what they wanted and the same thing was true on abortion well because you rely on the courts when the courts flipped to the other side there's now a lot of power in in the in the hands of the right I will talk about what that means and what the courts should be doing in just one second first I want to point out that you know some of us have been dreaming of being on Supreme Court our entire lives so mr. president if you're listening to this I would just remind you that when 12 year-old Ben Shapiro was playing at the Israeli bons banquet in 1996 Larry King talked specifically about the dreams of that young man Hiro is 12 years old he'll be accompanied by his father David he began training on the violin at age five in addition to the vile any place chess loves baseball completes in track and field his goal is to become the first Orthodox rabbi to sit on the Supreme Court meaning of court court will have to close at three o'clock on Friday so I'm not saying that it's something that I would I would take some things to job that were offered to me I would take I'm not saying that both Ann Coulter and David Limbaugh said in 2005 when I was still at Harvard Law School I should be on the Supreme Court I'm not saying that I'm 34 years old and I'd be on the Supreme Court for the next 60 years mr. president but if you chose to make that pick would I turn it down I don't know I don't know I mean it's not like I'm I don't know I'm not bad enthusiastic about it I mean
