00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,950
When I was 12 my mother had an unexpected, baby

2
00:00:05,859 --> 00:00:07,120
I

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,700
Wanted to learn how to do everything feed her change her entertain her

4
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:15,839
She was kind of scoring me, and she never liked to get her nails clipped

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,028
and so I went to clip this one nail and almost cut the tip of her thumb off I

6
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:28,229
Swooped her up and ran downstairs and called my mother. She just really calmly

7
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:33,959
Told me to wrap something around her thumb distract her and just make sure that she was

8
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,719
comfortable

9
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:44,669
You know you don't learn everything first and then apply it it all just happens and figure it out

10
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:49,919
When I was 18 they told me that I had PCOS

11
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:55,019
They've always said when you get older. It's gonna be hard for you to have children I

12
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:03,390
Was 25 working for a financial company, I was also hostessing on a bar at night I

13
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:09,659
thought I was just like gaining weight, and I was just like so tired I

14
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:16,799
Had been on the pill. I was like. Eh, maybe I should just take a pregnancy test I

15
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:20,009
was terrified I

16
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:29,309
Was finishing a PhD and that seemed like a reasonable time to start thinking about having a baby

17
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,510
I

18
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,160
Really didn't think there was anything wrong

19
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,389
We finally went to see reproductive endocrinologist

20
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:51,300
At 30 I had no eggs it made me feel cheated

21
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,759
Trying to do things according to some kind of plan was obviously not working I

22
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,379
Found out that I was you know five months 20 weeks along

23
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:14,579
they said that I could go you know if I did want to terminate the pregnancy there are a few states I

24
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,000
Cried on my sister shoulder probably the whole day I still felt like a baby

25
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,699
It just felt like this incredible slap in the face

26
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,360
My baby sister is now gonna. Have a baby and I'm gonna have to help

27
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:36,209
because I love her so much and I

28
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,940
Would do anything for her?

29
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,999
And yet, I thought this would be the hardest thing I would ever have to do

30
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,910
She was like if you

31
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,230
Want to terminate I'm there with you and I'll fly with you

32
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,550
I will totally support you and any choice a you make I

33
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:10,529
Think I asked her once or twice even then are you sure I would be okay if you weren't sure

34
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,629
I never thought about changing my mind I

35
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,229
Slept in her hospital room

36
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:31,930
With our boy on the cot with me curled up three of us for that first night

37
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,358
I remember saying do you see now yeah you see what you gave to me? I?

38
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,280
hope you

39
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,280
realized how

40
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,859
Huge

41
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,469
That was I mean yeah

42
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:56,199
It's the bravest most amazing thing I've ever seen anyone do

43
00:04:00,450 --> 00:00:00,000
You
