I'm action Ratan team you're watching a special edition of going underground as NATO defence ministers meet in the Polish capital Warsaw ahead of one of NATO's largest ever military exercises and with legendary journalist and filmmaker John Pilger John thanks for coming back on you're welcome let's go straight to your latest piece you quote the late Robert Perry of consortium news claiming that there are approved opinions and brushed aside unapproved evidence yes well I think you can categorize the news as approved or unapproved basically we're allowed to see the approved news but not allowed to see the unapproved news it's usually the unapproved version is the evidence doesn't have to be proof but is the evidence it's the piece in the puzzle that allows us to make sense of the news we're denied that okay but then it makes it a bit complicated but more complicated when it comes to Iran because Britain isn't now after many years of opposing Iran on the same side as Iran and Russia and China against the United States on the Iran nuclear deal what do you make of Trump appearing to threaten their on again and again and Britain being on the same side as Russia and Iran that was really hurt in a mainstream media news it's such a complicated place the world it really is sometimes sometimes the pieces go to the wrong end of the board when it's convenient and sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend and therefore the most wicked alliances have to be forged and twist was evidence so yes if Britain doesn't want and most of the EU don't want Trump to go ahead and sanction Iran and all down the Iranian government because there are riches to be made in Iran there are there is great trade to be done in Iran there is oil to be bought in Iran there is a great deal of advantage to be gained in the time-honored rail politic way of dealing with Iran truth be told they ever liked that is the UK and the EU never liked the US obsession with Iran the u.s. obsession with Iran goes back to the fall of the Shah of Persia who was one of the main pillars of us so-called foreign policy in the Middle East and when that came down in 1979 the US has never really recovered its sense it's its equilibrium if you like its power in the Middle East it once around back if not back it wants to deny Iran the independence of the Iranian state now why Trump in particular is obsessed with this I don't know but why shouldn't he be he's an American president he's doing what American presidents always do the fact that his Trump then causes apoplexy in the media and the intelligence agencies and so on for the very good reason that he's exposed America without a mask America and the presidency without a mask his Trump he's a character sure and he does what he wants to do but be assured that a president Hillary Clinton would probably be doing the same thing to Iran this is the same Hillary Clinton that when she first went campaigning in 2009 said at one rally that she was prepared to annihilate Iran I think there are 60 million plus people in Iran she was prepared for annihilation so it is it's basically what the American establishment wants to do but they don't want to be seen to be doing what Trump wants to do there's a internecine warfare going on within the United States between Trump and those who who who really are the institutional foundation of American power Clinton certainly Hillary Clinton said that they would bomb Syria but the National Security Advisor before he was detained went on this program said Syria would be a difference in policy under Trump they seem to be pro-russian but now they're saying the United States will be in Syria forever to attack Iranian facilities in Syria it's take us through where we are at Syria I mean we don't hear anything about Syria it's very difficult to tell I can't I couldn't I couldn't in any way chart American thinking it comes back online from time to time and it it's American so-called policy on Syria is pretty much the same as UK policy they're saying pretty much what they're saying now we've got to get rid of the Assad was then batter Assad's father we've got to get rid of this we've got a control Syria they're obsessed with Syria to the point where in recent years they haven't really bothered whether they put in power and Damascus one of the paps one of the most media evilest and vicious regimes one could imagine that led by Isis my own reading is the Trump would like to get out of Syria it's messy it's costly for him he doesn't really need it there's no morality here he just pragmatically doesn't want it but there is Russia in Syria quite successfully in Syria if you like having helped to stave off a major defeat of the government so he feels he must face up to them well Venezuela in the Western Hemisphere is in British media every other day I mean it's odd because it seems so far away why suddenly it's Venezuela a big issue the approved evidence would suggest Maduro is some kind of dictator what do you make of what's going to happen in Venezuela I should add that seven countries Argentina Colombia Chile Peru Paraguay um say that Maduro should go to the International Criminal Court that's just after he's been recently seen with the Chinese authorities well that's going back to the old days the United States used to have the entire Latin American continent its so-called leaders as its Stooges basically who would say what they what the United States wanted them to say when you when you mentioned we go back to the the unapproved news that is news we don't hear about there's been an attempted coup in Nicaragua a coup by the United States very very similar to the one that carried out in Honduras nearby very similar to the one it wants to carry out in Venezuela but it's failed in Nicaragua now that failure is unapproved therefore we don't really hear about it we hear obsessively Venezuela is the kind of Syria in news terms of of the Latin American continent I mean going back which I think a little bit of that background is necessary when you I read just before I came in here a study by the University of the West of England into BBC reporting of the the major Chavez years that is 1998 to 2008 it took 304 news reports on the BBC about Venezuela three three out of 304 mentioned anything positive about a government that had more than half the poverty in that country and had set up a whole infrastructure of welfare and education for the first time in Venezuela Chavez was the most elected man in the world I have to say held the world record for going before the people to be elected Maduro must closely follow but his country is in difficulty and one of the reasons major reasons it's in difficulty the major reason in my view is that the total collapse of oil and the the also the collapse of any real will inside Venezuela perhaps deal with it but when I say that I I I want to mitigate that with the massive war of so-called sanctions that rather benign word that's used of a blockade on Venezuela President Obama you may remember core Venezuela a threat to the national security of the United States and he began really that whole blockade the Trump is now enforcing on on Venezuela the fact that Venezuela has held out the government has held out I suppose that in many ways the society has held out although it suffered a great deal for as long as it has his extraordinary so do you think the effective sanctions you call it a weapon of war is not as effective nowadays of course the USA sanctioning Russia sectioning China in a way the tariffs do you think the days when a good sanction the country's governance out of existence are over depends how powerful that country is Russia is massively sanctioned but Russia goes on it goes on and has formed very close alliance with China China is a bit sanctioned might be more sanctioned it doesn't really give a damn actually but we don't have a sense of this great hinterland of alternative power Russia and China of this if you like the erosion power we we don't get a sense we're so we're so Atlantic centric if you like that we think only of Europe the United States the so-called West all the time but there is a normos part of the world that yes it's sanctioned but it's getting on and it's getting on in many areas particularly forging alliances with other countries very very successfully in this latest article of yours you exhort readers and viewers to translate a kind of news speak publicly the slashing of public expenditure you translate into what they we efficiency savings the destruction of civilized life you say is really the translation of hard choices it's a complete invention - ten years ago were now mourning the anniversary of the great crash if you remember the way the great crash in Wall Street and in the City of London elsewhere was reported it was it was reported as the crooked banks it was quite astonishing right across the British press you would see his their fault extras the banks and and we named the guilty bankers and people will be hauled out and they'd be shamed in public has usually lesser beings ashamed in the public in loosely trade well and others but so that lasted I calculated for just under a year about nine months and then it changed it wasn't the debt the crooked banks Alistair Darling Gordon Brown's Chancellor forked out five hundred billion pounds effectively gave it to the banks I'm sorry if I'm a few billion out there but it was an epic amount of the country's treasure it was a hard choice and gave a hard choice and that was good the approved news was that was good but the che the crooked banks and the crooked bankers then disappeared from the media instead the a word that was just lying in the dictionary been used from time to time during the Second World War austerity was hauled out and we now have something called austerity and austerity means that all the civilized premises of life in this country have to be attacked have to be undermine the hospitals have to be starved of our funds the pair the the poor people have to remain poor people and indeed get poorer everything has to be cut back councils have to lose something like up to 40% of the the money they have available to do normal things for people in it that is their responsibility that when overnight the debt became our debt it became people's debt the whole notion of crooked banks went completely I've never known actually I've never known a reversal of from fact to illusion so completely and it was accepted it was accepted by all sides it was accepted by both sides in Parliament is accepted by all media would be yes but even those that had named the guilty bankers with such enthusiasm no longer name than austerity had to be solved the debt had to be paid back above all it was a complete corn that was an ideological situation the National Health Service could have been paid several times over by the money that fled this country hemorrhage from this country allowed by the tax regime sure I'll stop you there more from John Pilger after the break welcome back I'm still with award-winning journalist and filmmaker John Pilger John you say the 2012 Health and Social Care Act so what four years after the crash of Lehman Brothers ended legally Universal free health care in Britain yes it did before 2012 the Secretary of State had a responsibility when Beveridge wrote the original Charter and an IRA and Bevan brought it to law in 1948 it was very simple and very clear it was based on a great cooperative thing that collectively the the the state and the society had responsibility for all our health and the responsibility the ultimate responsibility rested with the Secretary of State health - to see that all that happened the the 2012 Health and Social Care Act took that away and created an enormous quango have called NHS England and the fragmentation of the NHS began I have to say it's a in many respects it's rather a brilliant subtle operation because it's got a kind of deniability built into it no we're not privatizing we're just fragmenting it and we'll give it to others quietly that that was done on the back of this invention austerity now I think all that is worth understanding I think is worth understanding in its own terms but worth understanding in terms of our theme of approved and unapproved news the BBC reporting of the 2012 Health and Social Welfare Act was really you could they had less bill which gives power to gene pieces well which is a complete distortion or but they some summed up this bill that really abolished an ayran Bevans whole notion of a national health service and which most of the people of this country I would suggest still believe is the notion of a national health service okay if that's the BBC headline about that you also quote something if anyone thinks Britain isn't in the lead in some things you said a survey sites the BBC was bottom of nature a nation broadcasters in offering opposition airtime in the run-up to the Iraq war Libya Syria and three that's correct that was a immediate Nos that's what I said any other NATO it was below I was vaguely surprised to see though not really I suppose the BBC just below the American networks the likes of Sea then in offering so little facility to those who opposed the invasion of Iraq and I have to say who represented the majority of this country who also opposed it and another follow-up academics study by the University of Wales at Cardiff found pretty much the same thing it said that basically what the BBC reported was what the government wanted it to report it didn't really challenge it amplified what the government was saying and we know that the government was lying through its teeth the anti year corbin paper if i put it that way The Guardian you don't seem to like that paper too much I mean when editor Katharina says it's a progressive a thoughtful and progressive newspaper and you say particularly when it comes to Julian Assange of course is in well it's so thoughtful and progressive and in the way it's conducted a a cam of a campaign of unrelenting vindictiveness against Julian Assange why do you think the Guardian hates Julian Assange it's it's sometimes it strikes me as a kind of unrequited love for something Assange they fell in love with and they got a lot from him they exploited him they won all sorts of awards they got Hollywood movie deals they got a book they ended up getting a fable pulitzer was basically on the back of what Assange and WikiLeaks in its brief tenure with the Guardian had had given them but once that affair was over Assange received the full force of the Guardians displeasure and I think in that article I quote a number of its leading columnist in the kind of abuse that I don't think I've seen in a serious newspaper I can't remember I've seen actually against an individual the science refused to be a member of the club he shamed so many journalists because he had more firsts if you like in scoops in what wiki leaks revealed than they've had in their whole head in lifetimes he was so successful and he showed I think that the media is really had probably always has been never more so than now an appendage of established power he shone a light on that and that was unforgivable and yet it was just one small organization WikiLeaks because I know you also quote the disgraced CIA boss former CIA boss Petraeus saying a war of perception conducted continuously using the news media is what is being called for isn't that just something they say to their people no no well they certainly it'll come out of all their dreadful corporate jargon cluttered conferences that they they go to but the head of the British force was the chief of general Starr I think January this year's Nakata said said pretty much the same thing he said that you know what what appeared in the media was much more important than defeating the enemy now what they're saying on both sides of the Atlantic is that they're identifying the true enemy in a war of basic propaganda a lot of people are killed in this war propaganda but it is a war of propaganda the main enemy are the people at home the main enemy for General Petraeus were the American people the main enemy for Sanok Carter are the British people its they'll end up with unapproved opinions and that could be calamitous for a world without militarism without nuclear weapons all the things that they don't want and they feel they feel very insecure about clearly look you began by we began by talking about those military exercises and I know in your latest article you end with with another figure than Leni Riefenstahl the propagandist for the for the Nazis in the end this channel obviously or T are standing for Russia which you mentioned in the context of world war two has been targeted and the prime minister in Parliament said that people should not appear on it what sort of what do you make of the attack on this yes well it's it's beating heart of the propaganda or isn't it my experience with RT is that it produces news and views that by and large you don't find in other places my only criticism of RT is when I think it perhaps tries to be a little bit too respectable from time to time perhaps like the BBS that never happens to you after and so that that's that's encouraging so it's a difference it provides a different perspective and it has a chance and it also has rather high standards in my view I think it's journalists a professional it's use its people it's some of its journalists are very brave actually we've noted some journalists in the past year we've lost some yes yes so all this is something of a threat and when you but most of the attacks like the attacks on Julian Assange have come from the other media haven't they when it's it's the Kremlin controlled RT it's absurd and so wrong I think it's very good news that RT has weathered all this at least I hope it has jeremy corbyn's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said on the statement daily BBC that he won't appear on this show say he's been on this show before and other of Corbin's MPs shouldn't appear on this channel actually he was invited I think to say that by Andrew Marr on the very establishment bellweather program the Andrew Andrew Marr show and he I think from memory he agreed well I know this shouldn't happen anymore that's extraordinary isn't it coming from a journalist it just it ran a bus straight through the any notion of free speech and bought the establishment view of the kind of discussion we're having as something that's controlled by invisible puppet masters in the Kremlin it's so ridiculous so absurd and so unbecoming of jeremy corbyn's number two but you know the problem with parliamentary politics one of the problems is there's because we have a media that has sort of put out a contract for Jeremy Corbyn and attacks him unrelentingly there is no critical real critical discussion from the other side I hate to say it but even from the left there is no real critical discussion outside a program like this there's nothing on the BBC there's nothing really on any of the other mainstream programs so MacDonald can ingratiate himself as he was doing clearly with Maher on the BBC by saying that and not be challenged that's a pity John Pilger thank you that's it for this special edition of going underground see you again on Saturday just after this year's Nobel Peace Prizes announced until then keep in touch by social media we'll see you on Saturday 42 years to the day of the CIA link destroy of a Cuban passenger plane killing all 73 people on board
