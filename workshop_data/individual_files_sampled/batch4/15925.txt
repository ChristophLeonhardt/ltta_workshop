so much to talk about but I'm gonna try to squeeze a lot of it into a little bit amount of time as far as the wall yes the wall that we saw and stood at today between Jerusalem and Palestinian territory you guys keep watching I'm gonna have more of that coming up today on the Hollywood conservative for the rebel so many incredible things to talk about I mean it would take hours upon hours upon hours to tell you everything that we saw and learned an experience today I'm going to focus on one of the things that we did because I'm learning that long videos are not uploading with my data plan here nor on crappy hotel Wi-Fi hotel Wi-Fi is the worst okay so this morning started out with a briefing from Colonel Danny Terezin he is former current former colonel of the IDF he was the chief negotiator with Yasser Arafat and the Palestinians incredible man had so much information to share I'm going to share it with you I've got lots and lots of notes but I'm going to try to skim through these pretty quickly so going back to Bill Clinton administration Israel was willing to give up the West Bank and Gaza for Palestinians to stop their aggression Yasser Arafat said no way Jose a few minutes later the Palestinians started attacking so the reason I mention these things is because we see what goes on and what they tell us in the American media and it's just straight up bull you know what straight up propaganda so where we were standing we were at the wall the wall the wall that we should have on our southern border in the United States and I'll get to that in a minute so less than 12% of bethlehem which was just on the other side of the wall I think it's like less than two kilometers from where we were standing just on the other side of this wall is only 12% Christian now majority Muslim how sad is that same with Nazareth so a lot of these iconic ly Christian and biblically symbolic places are now Muslim majority there Oh from what we could see from that wall there is this like pristine white multi condominium complex looks like something that you would see in Panama City Beach or in Orange County or I don't know some beachy Shore in the United States this condominium complex is a refugee camp so they're not showing that on the news it is the only place on earth where fourth-generation refugees can reside not just first-generation but they can have kids and then they can have kids and then they can have kids and they can be propped up by the UN refugee resources so education health care food all of that it added it up so the way that this wall is set up on the Israeli side it's like a big deserted field now on the other side of that field so a picture you are staring at this wall there's a big field in front of you there are homes behind you that have bulletproof glass because so it's all stone has bulletproof glass to the degree that if you were walking into your kitchen at night and you open your fridge and the Palestinians see a light on in your kitchen they will start shooting now the rules of engagement on either side are very different the reason that I described the topography and the landscape is because on the other side of the wall in the Palestinian side of the wall it's all homes now Israelis if they detect someone on the other side of the wall they will not shoot because they don't want to hit innocent civilians on the Israeli side of the wall Palestinians have no problem with that because there are not a lot of civilians immediately on that side of the wall so the rules of engagement are very different the mentalities are very different Palestinians shoot at will don't care Israelis are caring about the civilians on the other side of the wall even though they are their enemies and they don't want to hit innocent civilians let's let's go back from Bill Clinton let's move on to Obama so senator Obama back when he was still a senator yeah 42 year old junior senator back when he was a senator he was in Israel speaking to Danny tearsa and he said they were talking about the wall and and the shooting that happens in the conflict across that and senator Obama said to him why don't you just move the wall back he's and Obama said to him you are using the security issue to take Palestinian land that's what he told this man let's see what else can I say okay so it is 44 centimeters wide it is 9 meters high Danny tearsa said that people would ask him why so high and he said well because 6 meters some very very talented and agile people could conceivably climb 9 meters not so much and then people asked why is it so ugly and on the Palestinian side well excuse me on the Israeli side yeah it's ugly it's just a plain concrete wall but it's not that ugly there's some graffiti Palestinians have written on it in graffiti that Israelis are Nazis does that sound familiar mm-hmm on the Palestinian side apparently it is covered in graffiti top to bottom all over but we were asking him why they allow them to graffiti because it just seems really disrespectful I mean it's Palestinian so what do you expect but he said you know Israelis let them graffiti because graffiti kind of allows them an outlet to release their aggression and that's better than violence but the thing that was so stark and amazing to me I think those are all the things that I wanted to talk about something that was so amazing to me is the dichotomy between what we were seeing there and the rules of engagement and the way that the Israelis handle aggression with the other side the difference between that and what you see on American media American media talks about you know apartheid which by the way is not true because there are Arabs living on the Israeli side and Jews living on the Palestinian side but the difference between that and and what we see in American media and the sympathy that we see you know all of these other mainstream media organizations exhibit towards the Palestinians and it's just insane I'm gonna try to compile my notes and and possibly post them in a blog later on this week for you guys so that you can kind of see more specifically the statistics and things that I collected I hope you are all having a great week so far I hope you had a great weekend we got 4th of July in a couple days and we will be at the American Embassy here in Jerusalem on the 4th of July so I'm really
