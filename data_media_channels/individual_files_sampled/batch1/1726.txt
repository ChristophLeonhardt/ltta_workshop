the US president raises the stakes in his trade dispute with China he's also threatening to take aim at Europe it may be just a negotiating position but it also raises the question is the global consensus around free trade coming to an end this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm deadia navigator for decades there has been a broad international consensus free trade as goods protectionism is bad well closed markets make nations poorer and the free flow of goods across borders ultimately benefits everyone but now that idea is being challenged from an unexpected corner the US has always been the world's biggest champion of free trade but Donald Trump is threatening allies and rivals alike with duties and tariffs his main target so far has been China but on Thursday he made it clear he doesn't see China as the only problem in many respects I think we're going to have a fantastic relationship long-term with China but we have to get this straightened out we have to have some balance and that goes for other countries and it goes for other places if you look at the European Union it's very solidly against us in terms of trade it's very unfair look a young girl shaking her head yes you know about the European Union it's like it's almost we can't even do business they send their cars over here they send everything over here we don't want to take our product so we can't let that happen well now China hardly the world's most open country when it comes to trade finds itself a vocal defender of free trade and globalization who will move on if the exist on unilateralism and a trade protectionism against the wishes of China and the international community we will fight to the death at any cost we will resolutely fight back and take new measures and protect an interest of our country and the people well Trump set off the current trade tensions when he imposed wide-ranging duties on steel and aluminum they didn't specifically target China but they still provoked a response Beijing announced tariffs covering 3 billion dollars worth of US imports these were focused on agricultural products including pork wine and fish the US up the ante this time slapping levies on China's tech and industrial sectors these affect goods worth fifty billion dollars China responded in kind outlining tariffs on fifty billion dollars of America goods including soybeans cars and chemical products and now Washington is mulling duties on another hundred billion dollars of Chinese imports well it's worth noting that only the steel and aluminum tariffs are in effect so far leaving a window for a negotiation over the rest on the panel today I'm joined there from Singapore by Deborah Elam she's the executive director at the Asian trade center in Hong Kong andrew leung and international china strategist and in birmingham that's in the UK Scott Lucas is joining us he's a professor of international politics at the University of Birmingham welcome to you all Deborah M's Trump is saying that we've already lost the trade war we don't have a trade war with China if it's not a trade war what is it well that's a good question I think we're at the beginning of a trade war I don't think we're quite in the middle of what could be a full-blown trade war although we haven't really had one so it's it's kind of hard to define what one would look like but if you were in the middle of one I think this is what it starts to look like this escalation counter escalation threat retaliation etc so if we're not in one we are perilously close to being in one here's the thing though Deborah the US is allowing 60 days for feedback and it hasn't really specified when the tariffs would take effect so effectively some people saying Trump is leaving a window open for talks is that what he's doing here is he leaving some sort of room for negotiations possibly the window is actually shorter than that he has there was a 30-day comment period here and the entire process by the US side has been held under something called section 301 under which the United States although of course it's a unilateral decision by the US but under which the United States has effectively one calendar year or so to make a determination and that brings us to about August 10th August 11th that is remarkably short for the kind of complex negotiations that would have to take place especially when the two parties really haven't yet begun the discussions so I think that while we might be able to all these kinds of issues whatever those issues happen to be and that's a separate issue I'm sure we'll get to in a minute the time is not that long for a very intensive set of negotiations that have to unfold andrew leung chinese state media is saying that beijing has many more weapons in its arsenal to deploy against the u.s. in the event of a trade war what sort of retaliation can we expect from China well you would look at these are terrorists in fact this is only a constitute only a small part of China's export to the United States because nowadays as China's economy is winning yourself away from too much dependence on exports so it is the economies is shifting towards internal consumption shifting sewer services whereas if we look and on the American side for example these retaliatory tariffs from China account for a sizeable proportion of America's export to China for example soybeans and also cars a China being the biggest customer so that's point number one China is targeting at those big ticket items particularly those items which hurt president Trump's constituency secondly there are of course other weapons for example China of course has a deficit in terms of trade in services now this trauma administration's rhetoric about the huge trade deficit and of course the tray only refers the tray in goods but you will it completely ignores the tremendous trade surplus America enjoys in trade in services with China so China can also wreak a lit on services and and thirdly of course it's the nuclear option which of course would hurt China as well which is of course China's not as say it is a big huge investor in US Treasuries so by buying less US Treasury it's going to push up and US interest rates and will hurt the US economy but of course in turn you were hurt China her China as well then how willing is Beijing to how willing is Beijing to come to the table and and find some sort of dealer possibly given to the US and give the u.s. some sort of concessions which then Trump can say well here are the concessions that we've gotten from China and that's a win for him well I think that the other problem of course is there are genuine grievances on a part of the United States apart from it deficit China is perceived to use measures which force American companies in China to share their intellectual property and of course there are accusations of outright intellectual property theft so I think that these are genuine grievances by American companies operating in China and somehow China has got addressed that but just focusing on the even balance again ignores the fact that there is both in training services as well which united states enjoys a huge surplus Scott Lucas in your opinion what is the president's justification in doing all of this is it strictly over the issue of intellectual property is it over national security which we've heard that argument being thrown about as well this is all about national security do you buy that and what problem are these tariffs really supposed to address well if you take if you have similar coherence here there is an issue as we've heard over intellectual property and the supposed theft of it by China that has been a long-standing issue but this has not been a coherent process we need to realize that the politics behind this and that is the United States initially tried to impose steel and aluminium tariffs at the start of March but instead of directing them at China because China doesn't export much steel to the United States it hit American allies Canada Brazil Germany South Korea Japan so at the end of March the United States was forced effectively to pull back those stealing aluminium tariffs on the same day that they pulled back those tariffs they then made the announcement which said okay now we're going to aim at China by imposing the duties on sixty billion of goods so in other words it was partly because of the misfire over the impulsive imposition of the steel and aluminium tariffs that they took this political not economic but political decision now the second problem the second factor is is that that very quick decision at the end of March is actually divided the white house we know about Donald Trump we know he said loudly yesterday I will impose duties on more Chinese products we know that he has hard right advisers like Stephen Miller who is goading him into this but there are other advisers including his new economic head Larry Kudlow who actually think that tariffs are not the way to go with this and that's why this window that you've talked about whether it's 30 days whether it's 60 days whether it's until August means that not only is there the negotiation between the US and China I think you're going to see a negotiation within the White House about how far they actually go with this could this backfire on Trump in a way as Scott I know you're speaking to us from Birmingham but a lot of the products that China decided to impose tariffs on like soybeans like corn like pork for example they seem to be hitting a lot of the states in which Trump won in so could that could this plan backfire absolutely I mean I've got an uncle who's a farmer and already you've got farmers in those core states that you're talking about in the Midwest many of them that decided the election for Donald Trump in 2016 and those folks are concerned and they're saying if these tariffs are implemented and if China does retaliate we're the ones that are going to be hurt we've got US businesses some US businesses that are worried about their supply chains being disrupted and of course we've even got the American stock market you know in Trump always likes to say how the stock market is rising because of him not necessarily true but the reality is partly because of fears over a possible trade war that stock market is now turning downwards and that politically doesn't look good either it's got just one more question to you before I cross over to Deborah and Andrew because we're just reading now that you were mentioning could Lowe a moment ago and what he's just said is that China's response to the tariffs has been unsatisfactory what do you think that means well I think it means that the line right now that politically is being held is that all the advisors behind Trump are saying you know we're not happy that China announced it's tariffs in response to us they shouldn't have done that but again behind the scenes behind the scenes you've got the fundamental choice which is the White House has announced tariffs on up to sixty billion of goods threatening it on a hundred and billion more of that now that's just what they've announced implementing those tariffs is a far different matter especially with the domestic situation we've just discussed so in private who wins that battle the protectionist around Trump people like Peter Navarro the commerce secretary Wilbur Ross or is it those who question whether tariffs are going to hurt the US which is in private Larry Kudlow Stephen minuchin the Treasury secretary or do they somehow find some compromise between those two rather different positions Andrew Young China has formally challenged the us's tariff decision at the World Trade Organization what do you make of that response by China and why are we potentially going to see a lengthy legal battle here well of course China's main contour attack is that the the United States is throwing away all the all the rules of a WTO and China has been as a staunch a supporter of the WTO from which it benefits and actually the first thing that China does is to challenge the American action under the WTO rules now and at this stage of the game I think is a game of chicken and for the time being so the trauma administration is raising all the stakes again so China's retaliatory measures the Trump administration seems to be doubling down on the demands but that's the just the initial stage of a and actually a rivalry a great power rivalry between the United States and China not only on a trade front but of course the economic front don't forget the Trimble administration specifically targets the bait in China 2025 agenda which of course encompass all these ten big areas where China hopes to dominate the world so the Americans were saying well hey you know China is now targeting these areas of dominance and then you've China's exceeds so where is the United States so in effect this is more than tray this is about economic competitiveness this is about economic dominance and you extend the if you look at the the rivalry in a broader front it is really a great power re beyond the economic field as well for example the president Rahm is now challenging China's one of China's main red lines on Taiwan I mean the reason release of a recent enactment of the Taiwan Travel Act really touches on the very concept of a one time one China policy and then the Alliance's military alliances form with Japan with Austria with India strengthening the China containment policy so I think that we are at a stage of the game where we're seeing really big power Ryrie at play of which tre is only one of the many manifestations and Deborah president Trump also set his sights on the European Union he said that barriers and European markets have made it nearly impossible for US companies to do business there is this going to escalate now with the European Union how much of all of this has to do with this broad pattern of protectionism that Scott was talking about just a moment ago well I'd like to say that there's a clear strategy that's driving all of this I think you might be able to sketch out a path of great power rivalry something like that that you know sitting here dispassionately and looking at this you would say well that's clearly what's being being driven out of the US but I'm not convinced that this particular group has that kind of long-term strategy and focus I think what is happening our short-term decisions that are being made by a very small group of people some of whom have the knowledge that it they need to make the kind of decisions that they're taking but many of whom do not have that knowledge and the challenge that we're facing is that these are micro decisions being taken in the day the minute the hour that are adding up to increasing challenges and so for example Trump's complaints about the European Union I think came out of essentially nowhere I don't think he's received any kind of concrete briefing any kind of assessment that points out to him the ways in which the European Union has somehow blocked American exports I think that is Trump speaking off-the-cuff and suddenly that becomes part of US policy that now is causing scrambles inside of Washington yet even apologies per second of the people are struggling even if he is speaking off-the-cuff and this is no this is not really a thought-out longer term a strategy doesn't what Trump say have the potential to throw the global trading system into full-on crisis yes this is the problem with having Donald Trump as president right now in this particular circumstance especially surrounded with a very small group of people some of whom are frankly dealing in an alternative universe most notably Peter Navarro who he relies on quite heavily at the moment for driving policy visa vie China which is I think partly how we've gotten to this particular point where we are unleashing potentially a hundred and fifty billion dollars in sanctions against China for what is an unclear set of objectives again if the United States had been very clear about what it is that it wanted it said we want to go after China for IP violations or for technology transfer I think the US could have made a very compelling case could have gotten a Coalition of the Willing together could have really brought together some interesting things could have gotten a nice negotiation together could have had constructive dialogue with the Chinese I don't think that's what has happened and now instead of having a clear outcome we have an escalating tit-for-tat retaliation that is potentially spiraling out of control and bringing in the European Union and all of Asia and this is a quite dangerous situation Scott Lucas I see you nodding along with what Deborah has to say from Singapore but isn't it fair to say as Deborah was saying that the United States does have a legitimate problem with China when it comes to IP and I'll just put this figure out the u.s. trade representative has said this that a seven month investigation seven month long investigation found that Chinese theft of American IP currently costs between two hundred and twenty five billion dollars and six hundred billion dollars annually so isn't Trump right in trying to do something to address this problem something that the Obama administration wasn't able to do well I think Deborah said it quite correctly and that is there is a specific issue here about IP and Technology Transfer but there are procedures by which the United States could have brought the case either in direct talks with China or in multilateral discussions involving other countries who are also concerned with these issues but instead of pursuing that the Trump administration is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut and the reason why they're using that sledgehammer of sweeping tariffs let's be honest here it is not directly about the IP issue because Deborah is quite right here that is is that certain Trump administration officials who were led initially by the White House chief strategist Steve Bannon from the very outset said they wanted a confrontation with China they weren't shy about it now even though Bannon has departed some of those people who were close to him like Stephen Miller then Peter Navarro or have the ear of the President so this is a political move in part with all the issues that Andrew pointed out have to do with influence globally influence in the Pacific region where the United States or at least these advisers see this as either we win or China wins now when you play that type of zero Tong sum game no one wins and let's be honest here no one wins if these tariffs are implemented then you are going to have an effect on the global economy and if these tariffs are implemented ironically the power that is most able to cope with those tariffs is not the United States which is far more exposed in terms of its producers and consumers but is the Chinese who are going to be able to respond to that through a centrally planned economy much more effectively than the Americans can if choppiness people say it's war andrew young on this subject of war there is an argument that emerged after world war ii in fact that's that says that if countries are engaged together in trade then they are less likely to engage in political or military battles how much of that is being tested right now and what do you see is the way forward well one of the main problem of this kind of confrontation is the frustrations felt by the United States and indeed other Western countries that all the efforts spend in the past two decades trying to bring China into the group norms as it were a kind of a rule of law and then a fair trade and all these value systems seem to have failed because they're basically there is a lack of realization the Chinese unlike any other western country and there in China is unlikely to copy the Western kind of norms and and and value systems because basically each country is quite different and and in spite of the fact that china is a one-party state nevertheless china has succeeded in raising a lot of his people out of poverty and in growing China into the second largest economy in the world so I think that there is a lack of of understanding a kind of frustration that the West's efforts in trying to make China more like the West has failed one of the two obviously Americans is well-child of course as I said cannot allow to be coerced by by the West once again walking back to the days when China was being invaded the so called centuries of humiliation that is really very very deep in China's national psyche and of course under a very powerful a presidency China would not have would not be cannot afford to be seen by his people to knuckle under so China's going to retaliate China is going to defend its own interest and and taking the United States to the WTO but I think at the end of the game this is a no brainer I think American and their top advisors and some of them have written books on trade and and and apart from the on a tray side there are other Chinese halts for example John Bowden has been a a very hawkish guy is in charge it's now in charge of Foreign Relations form Americans foreign policy so I think that this is also a kind of rivalry between a quick power Ryrie seeing China as a potential challenger and herein lies the danger of the so call to sit at this trap and I think both countries realize this so I think that we are at the beginning of a game of chicken but I think that both sides realized that ended in a that they've got to go back to the negotiating table either openly or behind the scenes all right we will see what happens thank you very much Debra Elms from Singapore andrew leung from Hong Kong and Scott Lucas from Birmingham thanks for joining us
