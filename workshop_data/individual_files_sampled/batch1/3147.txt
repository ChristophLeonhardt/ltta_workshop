it's not about motivation motivation is a is a fickle little emotional thing and if you get too hungry sometimes you're not motivator if you get too tired sometimes not motivated or if it's been a long day you lose your motivation so that's why motivation doesn't matter to me one of the things we try to do in training was build those realistic scenarios that would put people in a really chaotic overwhelming situation there's a dozen things that are bearing down on you the pressures on how do you do this you have to prioritize and execute it so you can't take on those dozen problems simultaneously you're going to fail at all of them you have to take a step back favorite what the highest priority is executed toward that highest priority and then move on to the next priority and then the next Pro it's about the discipline it's about the discipline of holding the course knowing what you have to do and make it happen the battle is going to change and the priority will change so you're getting shot at from one direction and you start maneuvering your troops to engage the enemy and that direction always and you get shot from another direction you're going to have to be able to rapidly shift be able to communicate to your team and be able to flex it so life is like that for any business is like that those priorities going to rapidly change and you've got to be able to rapidly shift that communicate that to your team and it's all about prioritizing execute motivation is going to let you down discipline will stay by your side
