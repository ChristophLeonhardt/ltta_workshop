00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:15,929
welcome back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you ask we answer let's</font>

2
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:18,510
get right to the questions shall we the

3
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,820
first one comes from heavy hitter who

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,689
asks i just inherited 100k

5
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:27,390
congratulations<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm 28 no debt good job</font>

6
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,429
if you could make one big bet on the

7
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,308
market with it what<font color="#E5E5E5"> would it be uh well</font>

8
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:34,739
I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really in the business of market</font>

9
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,630
forecasting I think I saw some Goldman

10
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,399
thing where they said go long the polish

11
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,829
zloty and short the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Japanese yen in a</font>

12
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:43,860
pair trade but uh I mean that'd be a big

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,510
bet you know I would definitely save

14
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,700
some of it the other thing maybe think

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,879
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> emerging market peripheral Europe</font>

16
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,710
debt like Greece I mean again I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

17
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,629
know anything but I remember like last

18
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:56,850
March everyone was saying oh if you're

19
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,320
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy a corporate dead by only</font>

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,180
the safest triple-a stuff of what junk

21
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,039
and obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> this has been the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year of</font>

22
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,349
junk debt so right now everybody is

23
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,930
super negative on all that kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

24
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,299
polish debt or sorry Greek debt and all

25
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,420
those countries so maybe the consensus

26
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,710
gotten<font color="#CCCCCC"> to negative but again I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

27
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">know anything please don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take any what</font>

28
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,810
i say is advice another common surname

29
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,590
CNBC asks what are you buying right now

30
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,100
not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Chinese food I guess</font>

31
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,360
mainly sir<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lorenz as as the Abu Dhabi</font>

32
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,280
Investment Authority is trying to exit

33
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,439
the city deal do you expect any more

34
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,180
sovereign funds to sell stakes and

35
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,369
Western corporations to have cash to buy

36
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,350
distressed assets in Middle East<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

37
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,590
Eastern Europe the first part probably I

38
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,530
I suppose that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of these the</font>

39
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,509
sovereign<font color="#E5E5E5"> deals sovereign wealth fund</font>

40
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:53,189
deals that were made sorry during the

41
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:55,829
boom may be unwound to some extent as

42
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:57,750
the US<font color="#E5E5E5"> market</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recovered they see a</font>

43
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,329
chance to exit and as things hurt at

44
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,460
home as far as them buying distressed

45
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,920
assets in Middle East<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Eastern Europe</font>

46
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,369
it's possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eastern Europe probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

47
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:10,560
a place where<font color="#CCCCCC"> they look although look</font>

48
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,910
how well it worked for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them when they</font>

49
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,060
thought they were getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree</font>

50
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,830
d on all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> distressed banks and then</font>

51
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,360
those stocks continued to tank for a

52
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,069
long time so maybe they're a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

53
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:22,030
nervous<font color="#E5E5E5"> about taking big risks d cortex</font>

54
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,160
asks do you think Paul Volcker would

55
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,440
make a better fed chair than Bernanke I

56
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,120
don't know I Paul Volcker is really

57
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,530
popular people like them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and people</font>

58
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">think he is really forthright but who</font>

59
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,420
knows what it would act how he would

60
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually be during a crisis like this</font>

61
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,980
you know one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to consider when he</font>

62
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,099
was fed chair his battle was inflation

63
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:46,510
and he just had the stones to you know

64
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,459
hike interest rates and deal with the

65
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,630
fact that the economy was going to be

66
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,519
weak for a while and whip inflation this

67
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">is kind of a different situation we're</font>

68
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,120
battling right now and there's probably

69
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">a good chance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he would do the exact same</font>

70
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,660
stuff Bernanke would maybe his rhetoric

71
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,730
would be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little different but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

72
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">know i'm not i'm not particularly anti</font>

73
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:05,110
Bernanke<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not particularly provoke or</font>

74
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,290
in this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that the sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

75
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,209
disparity between them people see is a

76
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:11,230
little more black and<font color="#CCCCCC"> white than it</font>

77
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,200
really is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ss asks do you have any</font>

78
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,760
political philosophy or consistent

79
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,410
understanding of the world on the basis

80
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,470
on which you reason not really your

81
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,269
analysis seems to favor the wealthy and

82
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:23,980
I'm wondering why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's funny</font>

83
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've never you know pay attention that I</font>

84
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,730
don't think that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case if</font>

85
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,859
there is a reason why my analysis seems

86
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:31,810
to favor the wealthy it probably just

87
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">because I'm being contrary and everyone</font>

88
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,769
else is sort of their nails it doesn't

89
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:37,209
favor the wealthy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's boring to</font>

90
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:39,340
me so I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might be why as for</font>

91
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">political philosophy I'm basically a</font>

92
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:43,600
libertarian but I'm not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> all that</font>

93
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,540
dogmatic I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of find dogma and all</font>

94
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,910
that stuff to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get really boring and so I</font>

95
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,859
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to have a good time and say</font>

96
00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:52,720
stuff that'll get you riled up which I

97
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,090
seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done the last one is should</font>
