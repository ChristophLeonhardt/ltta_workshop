1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,100
- I tried to explain to you what it is

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,330
that is being pervade in
the pop cultural sphere

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,780
because the fact is, more
people know who Beyonce is

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,030
than know who any random
Congress person, senator,

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,300
or governor is.

6
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,990
So she has now cut a music
video with her husband.

7
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,120
It is not good.

8
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,953
Okay, it's not good.

9
00:00:16,953 --> 00:00:21,110
Rolling Stone, so this
song is called Ape bleep,

10
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,720
which is just great.

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,930
I mean, it's just, the
sophistication is incredible.

12
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,770
They filmed this at the
Louvre, and shame on the Louvre

13
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,940
for allowing this sort of
filming at the Louvre, right?

14
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,850
Shame on the Louvre for putting
this kind of crap in front

15
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,750
of actual great art.

16
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,640
But I love Rolling Stone's take on this,

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,150
I'm gonna read you Rolling
Stone's take a little bit

18
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,840
and then we're gonna go
through the music video.

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,810
Okay, so in the video for
Beyonce and Jay-Z's Ape bleep,

20
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,770
okay, bleep would be poop, Ape poop,

21
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,090
the first visual from the
pair's surprise joint album

22
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,140
Everything is Love, except when
Jay-Z's cheating on Beyonce,

23
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,040
the two stars romp through
the Louvre in Paris

24
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,650
seizing center stage in a high culture

25
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,460
palace that, like most
Western art museums,

26
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,870
historically made little
room for non-white artists.

27
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,310
Oh, God.

28
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,780
So we're gonna get an
entire music video about

29
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,750
why the Louvre doesn't have
enough art by black people.

30
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,090
Okay, first of all, the
Louvre does have some art

31
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,220
by black people, second of
all the Louvre has a ton,

32
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,540
the Louvre is a barn,
okay, it has tons of stuff

33
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,690
from every various culture.

34
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:15,050
It has Asian art, it has African
art, it has Egyptian art,

35
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:15,883
it has tons of stuff,

36
00:01:15,883 --> 00:01:17,020
it's just the most famous
stuff at the Louvre

37
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,870
is Western art because,
in my humble opinion,

38
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,320
Western art was the culmination
of Western civilization,

39
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,800
and Western civilization
is the culmination

40
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,310
of all civilization, in my opinion.

41
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,260
I'm a big fan.

42
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,880
So here's what the Rolling Stone says.

43
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,930
Some of their mission involves
the strategic highlighting

44
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,840
of non-white images already in the Louvre.

45
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,170
Beyonce and Jay-Z rap in
front of an Egyptian sphinx,

46
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,270
and in galleries filled with

47
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,070
mostly neoclassical French paintings,

48
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,220
white artists, white subjects,

49
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,530
the camera singles out black faces.

50
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,030
Okay, I'm not sure why that matters.

51
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,230
Viewers catch brief glimpses
of a pair of black figures

52
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,450
and Paolo Veronese is
painting the wedding at Cana,

53
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,100
where Jesus turned water into wine,

54
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,250
as well as a quick look at

55
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,370
Marie-Guilhelmine Benoist's
Portrait d'une negresse,

56
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,160
a depiction of a black
woman staring guilelessly

57
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,440
back at the viewer.

58
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,710
Why you would go to the Louvre

59
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,550
and the first thing that would hit you

60
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,150
is racial imbalance,
I'm gonna suggest that

61
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,680
the whole point of art is to take

62
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,410
the particular and universalize it.

63
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,480
Good art takes things that are particular,

64
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,540
and then it makes you
feel a universal feeling,

65
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,500
that's what great art does.

66
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,539
When you watch a movie that
has to do with people who

67
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:11,480
are nothing like you,

68
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,850
you feel something about Star Wars, right?

69
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,070
Star Wars is in an universe
far, far, away with people

70
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,040
who are nothing like you, but
you feel something about it

71
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,620
because there's something
unique to every human experience

72
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,160
that also happens to be universal
to all human experience.

73
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,870
This is why great art is
extraordinarily particular.

74
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,960
Tolstoy Dostoevsky, these people,

75
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,840
their writings are
extraordinarily particular.

76
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,950
It's not generalities, it's
not broad generalities.

77
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,420
It's why I don't like a
lot of modern literature

78
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,160
that I think draws broad generalities.

79
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,200
Great art is extraordinarily particular,

80
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,760
because you identify with other people

81
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,720
the more particular we
are about those people.

82
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,570
If I just say to you,
there's a guy who just

83
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,590
died in Zimbabwe, you're
not gonna feel anything,

84
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,620
but if I describe that guy to you,

85
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,820
if I described his entire life to you,

86
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,630
if I described his family
to you, you feel more

87
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,380
because I've now
particularized the subject.

88
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,880
Great art does that.

89
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,100
Okay, so of course if you have,

90
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,340
so the idea that it can't
be a universal piece of art

91
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,040
because it focuses on a white
subject is simply idiotic.

92
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,170
Okay, but the Rolling Stone says,

93
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,680
this is just a great piece of art,

94
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,940
this Beyonce Jay-Z video.

95
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,040
Beyonce and Jay-Z said about

96
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,020
interjecting blackness into a space that

97
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,560
has never placed much value on it,

98
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,500
claiming one of the center
pieces of European culture

99
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,820
with gleeful defiance.

100
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,240
They frequently film themselves moving

101
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,330
in opposition to the frozen
stillness of painting

102
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,510
by Jacques-Louis David, David,
a French neoclassical artist

103
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:23,120
whose works like the Oath of
the Horatii and Madame Recamier

104
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,370
invoked the Greco-Roman tradition.

105
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,530
Much of the potency of the Ape bleep video

106
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,850
comes from the contrast drawn between

107
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,890
the white art on the
walls and the black women

108
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:31,723
on the gallery floor.

109
00:03:31,723 --> 00:03:33,110
So it's all about race, of course,

110
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,810
and now we're supposed to
believe that the art being

111
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,760
created by Beyonce and
Jay-Z is actually better

112
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,780
than these great works
of classic Western art.

113
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,830
Quote, throughout the Ape bleep video,

114
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,610
Beyonce and Jay-Z repeatedly upstage

115
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,910
some of the Western classical
arts most famous images

116
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,560
in one of its central sacred spaces.

117
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,830
And then they talk about
how it's much more lively,

118
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,640
right, these people who are
dancing are much more lively.

119
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,230
It's not only Beyonce
who eclipses the art,

120
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,020
just a few scenes before
the singers' victory

121
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,990
over Venus de Milo, yeah, right,

122
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,430
I'm sure that Beyonce's victorious

123
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,430
over Venus de Milo, uh-huh.

124
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,240
A line of her dancers sway back
and forth in the foreground

125
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,460
while another white marble statue,

126
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,630
the Winged Victory of Samothrace,
looms inertly behind them.

127
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,590
Right, idiots, it's a statue.

128
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,870
It can't move.

129
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,390
Wow, you mean people
moving is more lifelike

130
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,829
than people not moving?

131
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,409
I cannot believe it.

132
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,700
Wow, you've really
upstaged Great Western art.

133
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,020
See, the thing about Western art, folks,

134
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,350
and all art, is that it's
supposed to outlive the person,

135
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,770
because all the people in
this video, they gon' die.

136
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,680
That statute's still gonna be there.

137
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,513
I love this.

138
00:04:30,513 --> 00:04:32,260
Beyonce and Jay-Z stand in
front of the Venus de Milo,

139
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,860
one of the Louvre's most
famous well-known statues,

140
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,020
the kind of white marble
creation that is synonymous

141
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,150
with European high art.

142
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,210
The statue is inert and famously armless.

143
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,010
Beyonce is fluid, fierce,
and in perpetual motion.

144
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,110
'Cause she's a living human.

145
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,130
Wow.

146
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,960
So's my two-year-old baby.

147
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,190
He has arms and he moves.

148
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,023
Okay?

149
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,410
Wouldn't say that he
upstages the Venus de Milo

150
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,370
if we went to the Louvre.

151
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,820
In fact I wouldn't
bring him to the Louvre,

152
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,150
'cause he'd knock over the Venus de Milo

153
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,420
and then I would be broke,

154
00:04:56,420 --> 00:00:00,000
so we're not gonna do that.
