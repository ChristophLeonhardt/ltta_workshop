and we're back with Elise Jordan Gene Robinson Daniel Goldman Clint Watson Casey hunt in the latest example of the record pace at which Democratic attorneys general are suing the Trump administration acting new york's new york state AG barbara Underwood is threatening legal action over Trump's proposal to replace the clean power plan an Obama era environmental protection standard aimed combating climate change meanwhile in a separate action filed in June AG Underwood is suing Trump and his three adult children alleging a pattern of illegal activity relating to the president's personal charity joining us now Fordham Law School professor and author of the book corruption in America Democratic candidate for New York State Attorney General Zephyr Teachout she has recently received the endorsement of the New York Times very good to have you on the show this morning it's wonderful to be on thank you so much so the president let's just let's just put this out there he's not above pardoning anybody that could happen in all of it yeah yeah yeah what's what stands out to you in everything that has gone down in the past 24 hours and how does it affect your campaign well it's really critical to understand that federal pardons do not apply to state law crimes and while New York State has some limits on what kind of crimes could be prosecuted after a federal pardon those limits are not absolute and it's really important that we send a signal right now that no one is above the law there are no get-out-of-jail-free cards and if Donald Trump moves forward with a federal pardon we in New York and the New York Attorney General's Office working with local DA's will be ready to investigate criminal activity that happened in New York of the person who is pardoned it's an interesting time your legal specialty to come into play can you talk about what you have specialized and dedicated your career to and why you think that that could be an asset as Attorney General yeah I'm an anti-corruption expert I have three days after Donald Trump took office in fact I was one of the lawyers who brought a lawsuit in the Southern District of New York demand that Trump divest his business interest because they're violating the foreign and domestic emoluments clause the Constitution and I've been leading the legal strategy working with others around the country on the emoluments clause litigation that you know will require Trump to basically choose between the presidency and his businesses and we just had a major victory in June but that deep expertise in anti-corruption law in constitutional law is really important right now because we are dealing with new legal issues that we haven't faced before and we got to be ready in new york new york state may end up being the firewall against all kinds of things that Donald Trump could do to try to make sure the law does not apply to him or to his associates knowing about corruption wouldn't hurt a New York State even is that this you know this the background that I have you know I happen to be one of the few people in the country who had already been engaged investigating the emoluments clause before Donald Trump took president became president but also you know one of the key things to understand here is New York State plays a special role all state attorney generals are important but New York State plays a special role because Donald Trump's foundation is here his organization is here and if you look at what happened yesterday you can see that the lines between the foundation and the organization and the campaign just from news reports are very blurred Barbara Underwood brought this really critical civil action in June it's a blockbuster case about the Donald Trump foundation but we already know enough to know that we need the investigations into the organization as well I mean this is like you got to follow the money that's that's corruption 101 follow the money Zephyr one of the the only person who has not pled guilty thus far in the Muller probe and has been charged as Paul Manafort and many people including me think that he is sort of aligning himself for a pardon and some of the language that the president has used in relation to Paul Manafort is very similar to language he used both for pardoning other people can you explain what kind of state charges you think may be brought against Paul Manafort if he does receive a pardon from the president well it's a it's a very fair question but since I may be in the position of actually bringing such charges I don't want to name particular kinds of charges that might come but the key thing to understand is that New York State has a broad array of criminal statutes involving financial crimes false statements a whole range of crimes that we should investigate and Barbara Underwood is an incredible Attorney General she keeps her hands close to her chest as she should so we don't know exactly what investigations are already ongoing but I will tell you that when I am the next Attorney General of New York we're gonna put real resources into those investigations because we have to be ready for the for the real constitutional crisis moment of Donald Trump doing a self-serving pardon to try to protect himself I'd like to point out a know your value moment I love it when I hear a woman saying I'm gonna win because women just don't say that they always are like well I might maybe I might just do my very best yeah yeah I'm gonna win exactly I love that zephyr Clint Watts I want to make a point for you to comment on and then you can take a question to his effort but I really just given the first hour of the show on I'm a little struck by what Lanny said about Michael Cohen's turning point that it was Helsinki and that he saw sort of add evolving in Trump's brain that his bad behavior was going to extend instead of pull back and that he could hurt this country that matches what I feel and know about Trump that he deflects whenever he's under siege and many consider this president to be Vladimir Putin's useful idiot and I am concerned he will make a huge effort to deflect probably using Fox News hosts as his sounding board and try and deflect from these headlines but in the process put our nation at risk and as an FBI profiler is this something that that you would be concerned about is this a realistic concern do I sound crazy yeah you're not crazy and in fact I think the president even said at different times he sort of offered up I would be a good time for a war or maybe I need a war maybe I need a trade war essentially I need a conflict we have taken seriously yeah yeah he tends to tell you exactly what he's going to do later on and I've always wondered sometimes it's hard to tell North Korea that was a critical issue a year ago I think we started talking about on the show that suddenly just fizzled out you know we've not seen any progress really on nuclear negotiations now we see a lot of ramped up with Iran is that really because we need to deal with Iran or because it's a useful distraction for the president to try and build some sort of a conflict so I'm worried about those things and this kind of ties into his effort I wanted to bring it to you the question about federal versus state I work a lot with federal and state law enforcement and so you've got a Attorney General Sessions really pushing on crime immigration ms-13 that's what you'll hear and see you were talking a lot about public corruption and really white collar cases how do you see yourself if you're in New York really working with the federal government in terms of Investigations in law enforcement well well clearly it's gonna be important to work with the Moller investigation and to work also with local DA's you know there's different levels of these investigations but again New York State and the New York Attorney General has to be a firewall against illegal actions against cases where and we've already seen so many with the Trump administration weather where the federal government is actually violating the law pushing past the limits of what the Administrative Procedure acts and it's EPA roll backs and you know unfortunately what we see with with ice and CBP is this unbelievable willingness to argue essentially immunity for agents the extraordinary crisis moment a couple weeks ago where it looked like where a court ordered a plane to get turned around because but the sessions was not what was on the verge of not following a federal court order and again it's going to be really important for states to play the role in new york state attorney general in particular particular as a real firewall against illegal activity at the federal level and unfortunately we cannot trust that this i mean this administration has been pretty out there claiming immunity claiming the law doesn't apply to the president willingness to push the limits of what the federal government should do under its own laws so states are going to be more and more important in protecting against that all right new york state attorney general candidate
