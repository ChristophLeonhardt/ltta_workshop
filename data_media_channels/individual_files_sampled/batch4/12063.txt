even sexual harassment and assault can be made into partisan issues president Trump finally sounds off on judge Roy more plus Al Franken and we go to the mailbag I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show so yesterday I said that we were in the midst of a flaming garbage fire in American politics how wrong I was we were only on the edge of the flaming garbage pile yesterday but today we are definitely in the center of the flaming garbage heap after all the fallout from Al Franken after the fact that it now appears that every Democrat will end up standing with Al Franken and it appears that every Republican or a lot of Republicans wound up standing with Roy Moore it appears that no one really cares about bad conduct which is very upsetting to me personally cuz I don't like that but we will talk about all of these things in just one second first I want to say thank you to our friends over at quip so if you are if you're concerned about not just your oral hygiene but your

mechanism you don't have that with clips so get clip comm / up hero that also lets them know that we say okay so we there's a bunch of fallout from Al Franken and Roy Moore and I want to begin with a piece in today's Washington Post so yesterday they're a bunch of Democrats you sort of pretended that they about Al Franken so the allegation against Al Franken again is that he groped a woman while she was sleeping this this woman her name is Leanne tweetIn yeah Leanne Tweed she's a talk show host out here in Los Angeles and she alleges that Al Franken groped her while she was sleeping and then during a rehearsal I had written a kiss into a scene when he was a comedian and said he rammed his tongue down her throat which is just disgusting and so all of this had created an enormous amount of an enormous amount of controversy in fact we can start with Leon Sweden talking about Frank and here is what Leon Sweden had to say about its clip 9 the world that you're making for your children for your two-year-old and for your four-year-old do you realize that you are making it better for them I don't know the genders of your children but it actually doesn't even matter have a boy and a girl okay well but it's but both of them need to be impacted by this right not just the girl you know you always sorry nothing to be sorry about huh didn't thinking I was gonna do that but you know you do you you want to leave you know you try to set examples for your children right you want to leave the world a better place okay and so the allegations against Franken are obviously serious enough that yesterday bunch of people said well we'll start to send an ethics committee investigation and Franken himself calls for a Senate Ethics investigation there's only one problem with this it's total nonsense between 2006 and 2007 teen or between rather 2007 and 2016 there were six hundred and thirteen different Senate ethics investigation requests how many punishments were handed down how many sanctions were handed down zero giant zero so when Democrats say yeah we're treating Al Franken with the gravest seriousness no you're not Plus what would you have an ethics investigation about there's a picture of him trying to grab her boobs while she's sleeping what exactly is the is the investigation going to be senator franken did you try to grab that woman's boobs senator franken there's a picture of it but it was joke ethics committee well there's a picture of it him I take the fifth like well what is the investigation going to be about here exactly and now we know okay the fact is that the left is willing to throw people under the bus when they're no longer useful to them but they want to stick with them when they are useful right when it's Bill Clinton now they can throw Bill Clinton under the bus they were in a bunch of articles this week about how Bill Clinton should resign in 1998 thanks for getting around to it 19 years late getting and now they're a bunch of articles about how Al Franken should stick around so his woman in Kate Harding who's the co-editor of nasty women feminism resistance and Revolution in Trump's America so she's a feminist right she she hosts a podcast called feminists II which sounds like death on the ears and here is what and and she wrote a piece for The Washington Post today called I am a feminist I study rape culture and I don't want Al Franken to resign yeah I'm freaking shocked she says as a feminist and the author of a book on rape culture I could reasonably be expected to lead the calls for Al Franken's a step tone font of the step down following allegations that he forced his tongue down a woman's throat accompanied by a photo of him grinning as he moves in to grope her breasts while she sleeps it's disgusting he treated a sleeping woman as a comedy prop no more human than the contents of carrot tops trunk and I firmly believe he should suffer social and professional consequences for it but I don't believe resigning from his position is the only possible consequence or the one that's best for American women cynics on both the right and left will presume I am passing by this particular steam trance 17 smorgasbord the feminist outraged because Franken is a Democrat and so am i I was even as proud constituent for two years in the most superficial sense this is true and that's not just the most perfect that's like the only sense there is no deeper sense that you think Franken is gonna vote the way you arm to vote and so you're fine with this so this is just an this is just a variation on the old Time magazine columnist Neda brulees comment about Bill Clinton that she'd be willing to offer him oral sex so long as you kept abortion legal and we're seeing this on both sides of the aisle now and it's just gross and I think it's something we need to come to grips with our own gross misses humans before we can actually fix it if people talk about raising awareness so I'm not into raising awareness when it's counterproductive but I think it is about raising awareness when it comes to examining your own political motives because I think that we all have political motives and that leads us into certain cul-de-sacs of partisan aggression that I think are negative she says it's meaningless to say it's because I'm a Democrat without asking why I am a Democrat if you understand what it means to be a Democrat today that is why it makes sense to vote blue over red in this highly polarized political environment you can understand why it might not make the most sense to demand Franklin's resignation effective immediately I'm a Democrat because I'm a feminist who lives under a two-party system I am NOT a true believer in the party nor in any politician I'm a realist who recognizes we get two viable choices so this is the exact argument the exact argument that is now being used to back Roy Moore she says isn't that hypocritical I hear you asking because Republicans won't do the right thing we shouldn't either but if the short-term right thing leads to long-term political catastrophe for American women I think we need to reconsider our definition of the right thing okay so this is the exact opposite of the argument I mean it's it's the same argument actually that's being made it's just the photo negative of the argument that's being made by a lot of people who are backing Roy Moore saying listen if Doug Jones gets in the Senate he's gonna vote for abortion I hate abortion so if I have to choose I'll choose to vote for Roy Moore that's the say it's the photo- argument and the problem is that both sides make this argument we will get people who are alleged sexual molesters and sexual assaulters in the Senate chock-a-block they will be there all the time and then none of this is going to change change comes about when we realize that the ends don't always justify the means realize that yes I would not vote for Doug Jones yes I would you know I would not vote for Al Franken but that doesn't mean that just because somebody is bad I have to vote for their opponent or I can't find a third Lucian I can't find some sort of right in solution so all of this is very upsetting and disappointing and it makes us feel like we have nothing in common because we don't write we don't have anything in common if we're to the point where we believe that sexual molestation or sexual assault allegations can be put by the wayside because it's more important to defeat the other side then we can't live in a republic with each other we just can't I mean the the the the end of the republic has basically come now with all of this happening you can see that the politicians are using this particular mentality is a way to maintain power this is happening on both sides so you know for example Roy Moore has been hit with all of these terrible allegations he's coming back now and he's saying the Mitch McConnell should step down so the more partisan Roy Moore gets the more he knows he's protected right to harbor opposition he takes the more firing a position if he takes the more he knows that there are people who are gonna rally to his side so quote/unquote opposed the other side so here is Roy Moore attacking Mitch McConnell saying McConnell should be the one who steps down not me right not me I'm gonna stand here wearing my cross and American flag pin amidst allegations that I have not rebutted in any serious way Mitch McConnell is the one who should step down listen I'm not a fan of Mitch McConnell but this has nothing to do with McConnell but again the more partisan you can make the argument the more you know that people will rally to your side so here's my here is Roy Moore saying this all I want to tell you who needs to step down that's Mitch McConnell there's been comments about me taking a stand yes I have taken a stand in the past I'll take a stand in the future and I'll quit standing when they lay me in that box and put me in the ground well that's weird and then Bob Menendez does the same thing from the other side so Bob Menendez was not acquitted but there was a home jitters a mistrial in his trial yesterday and so he comes out and he turns it into a partisan issue knowing that his own side will rally around him as they were going to Democrats would not even answer the question whether if Menendez was convicted they would expel him from the Senate they might keep him there right now Menendez is coming out and making this partisan and making it even more partisan so the more part we now live in a dynamic where the more partisan you can make any issue any personal issue the better chance you have of surviving it right Bill Clinton was able to turn sexual molestation allegations sexual misconduct allegations he was able to turn those allegations in his own favor by suggesting that it was a vast right-wing conspiracy you're seeing more to the same thing it's best left wing and establishment conspiracy you're saying Bob Menendez do the same thing on corruption it's a vast right-wing and racist conspiracy here's Mendez doing that yesterday to those who left me who abandoned me in my darkest moment I forgive you to those who embraced me in my darkest moment I love you to those in New Jerseyans who gave me the benefit of the doubt I thank to those who were digging my political grave so that they could jump into my seat I know who you are and I won't forget you she's making him partisan right everyone who backed him he'll remember and he will love you and if I mean this is this mafioso type language right and if you if you didn't back him I'll remember you and I will never forget you your name will be emblazoned on my memory forever again if you can use partisanship to distract from your own misconduct then we're just gonna get the worst of the worst in in every situation okay so finally here's what happens done the the pole in Alabama right now with Roy Moore show the latest poll from Fox News shows that Roy Moore is down eight I don't believe that poll I think that a lot of people are lying to the pollsters and and I think that the race is actually much closer than that the reason I believe that is because if you look at the Alabama results for the last election cycles what you see is that no Republican candidate in Alabama since 2002 has lost has law has one less than 60% of the so Republicans outnumber Democrats in the state like two to one so the idea that he's losing by eight points would be truly shocking but you know that with that said he is you know apparently in a tight race he's losing the race and he won't step down and as I've said before the only person who could really step in and put an end to Roy Moore's run here would be President Trump so we'll get to president Trump's reaction to all of these things finally he's speaking out but not in the way that I would like we'll get to all of that in just a second but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors / Theo's concealed carry Association so if you are going on or can you say with 100% confidence that your family and your home are safe what if you're

address also lets them know that we sent you ok so president Trump is finally sounding off about about Roy Moore but he's not actually speaking so he sends out Sarah Huckabee Sanders to talk about it so what is his position that's a trump who has a position on everything right he had a position on Jamel Hill at ESPN he said she should be fired he said the Colin Kaepernick is a son of a bitch who should be fired right even though he wasn't really in the NFL of time yeah and you know I may agree with his assessments on people who kneel for the anthem and I may agree that Jamel Hill not that she should be fired I don't think she should have been fired but that she was wrong in her assessment of politics but he's been completely silent on Roy Moore for over a week even though he endorsed Roy Moore at for one more one the primary so finally Sarah Huckabee Sanders is trotted out to answer questions about about Roy Moore and what this does demonstrate by the way is that Sean Hannity in the White House are very much in court because as you recall Sean Hannity the night before last came out and said that he wants let the people of Alabama decide the White House is giving exactly the same message so that is a shift apparently there were reports that Sean had been getting calls from Bannon and from the White House saying back off Roy Moore a little bit so the White House is is also backing off of Roy Moore here's Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying that Trump thinks the people of Alabama ought to decide which is a truism again I said this yesterday you know when people say things like let the people decide what they're really saying is that they are not going to take a position right that's really what they're saying and that's stupid okay Trump is taking a position on everything his is I mean literally everything all the things Trump has taken a position on but here he chooses to go strategically silent the reason that that's bad is not just because I think it's immoral even though I do think it's immoral the reason that I think it's bad is because Donald Trump is one of the very few people in America who could actually make a difference in this Senate race and actually make sure that Republicans keep the seat without that seat being Roy Moore's here is here's Sarah Huckabee Sanders though basically kicking the can down the road the President believes that these allegations are very troubling and should be taken seriously and he thinks that the people of Alabama should make the decision on who their next senator should be look the president said in his statement earlier this week that if the allegations are true then that Roy Moore should step aside he still firmly believes that okay so you know that doesn't mean anything right we now know what we know okay what nothing further is really gonna come out here the idea that if true he should step aside but let the people of Alabama decide again the people of Alabama will decide right but he can have an impact on this race if you were to come out and say Roy Moore get out people of Alabama you know don't lose the Senate race because of Roy Moore that would actually have an impact in this race but that's not what's happening here then you know and then Trump tweets but but so Trump doesn't say anything about more right but he does have some things to say about Al Franken so the allegations come out about Franken he's been completely silent on Twitter right he's been over in Asia this was the excuse for him not commenting on more he comes back and now he's on he's on Twitter late at night and so Trump starts tweeting about Al Franken say tweets the l frank enstein picture and it's it Frankenstein right but he spells Frankenstein ie instead of E I again spellcheck says the Al Frankenstein picture is really bad speaks a thousand words where do his hands go in pictures two three four five and six while she sleeps random then he continues along these lines and he says and to think that just last week he was lecturing anyone who would listen about sexual harassment and respect for women Lesley Stahl tape the Lesley Stahl tape is a reference to him making jokes about about sexually abusing Lesley Stahl while she's asleep or something now so you know Trump is perfectly willing to sound off about Franken now a lot of people on the right love this about Trump that he's not shy about sounding off about political opposition and when it comes to the partisan battles this is the thing that they really enjoy about Trump is that Trump is always happy to throw a punch in the other direction this is also a really stupid strategy okay the reason this is stupid strategy is we are now going to get a full week of talk about all of the sexual harassment and abuse allegations against Donald Trump okay there were something like 15 or 16 women who made sexual assault or harassment allegations against Trump at the end of the last election cycle we had not yet had the Harvey Weinstein blow-up so now we're gonna get to redo all of that which is really really exciting and it's one of the reasons by the way I think that Trump has not actually come out and openly condemn more because the problem is that once you condemn more once you get involved in these issues now it comes back around to you right just as Trump says you know Al Franken was talking about sexual harassment and negative way but then he was sexually harassing people it's very hard for Trump to be the leader the tip of the spear on sexual harassment and abuse and Huckabee Sanders was specifically asked by a reporter over at Fox News about this right here's Huckabee Sanders being asked to comment on the allegations against Trump we should find one set of allegations very troubling and on the other we shouldn't pay attention to them at all or we should totally disbelieve them well I think the president has certainly a lot more insight into what he personally did or didn't do and he spoke out about that directly during the campaign and I don't have anything further to add beyond that okay so basically we're gonna keep silent on this because we don't want the blowback to come back around this is the problem with having our standards that we have our own double standard okay we have our own double standard and then our politicians pay the price for the double standard on the one hand we say that if they're on our side we don't care and on the other side on the other hand we say if they're not on our side we do care that double standard has ramifications for politicians because it means that Trump is gonna want to condemn Al Franken but if he condemns Al Franken it's gonna come back around to trump and then the right is gonna have to suggest it was that the allegations about Trump are not credible but the allegations against Franken are super credible which I don't buy by the way I think the allegations against Trump we're credible during the primaries I think they were or during the general election I again don't say that you shouldn't have voted for Trump to stop Hillary but I do think that yeah I didn't yeah you know I didn't vote at the top of the ticket because I take these things very very seriously so you know the idea that that we can have as a people this double standard in our mind that has to change so either we're gonna say as a public we're gonna say as a public one of two things we care about these allegations enough to get rid of people doesn't matter their political affiliation or we don't care enough to get rid of people doesn't matter that our political affiliation we're gonna have to make that decision otherwise we just have this hypocritical standard now I do want to talk a little bit about the generalized societal problem that's that's coming up with some of these sexual harassment allegations and that is as I've said now for a couple of weeks really six weeks since the Harvey Weinstein's stuff broke we as a society do not have a consistent standard that we are applying with regard to what sort of allegations to take seriously and what sort of allegations not to take seriously so well the reason that I say this is because we are treating sexual harassment allegations where a guy has said something nasty and untoward to a woman the same as we are treating rape allegations and that seems to me not correct I think that you can condemn both but I don't think they are worthy of equal levels of condemnation now for example there is the the actress Ellen Page and Ellen Page had this whole thing about my director she worked with or a fellow actor she worked for the count member who she's talking about who had said some you know it was Ratner I was about Ratner I guess who's had a lot of sexual allegations made against him and she says that Brett Ratner at one point made some sort of nasty lesbian reference to her on the set and this is bad it is bad okay and he deserves to be condemned before that obviously and then she says in that same allegation in the same Facebook post she says that at one point she was sexually assaulted by a grip okay these are not the same kind of thing right they're both bad but they're not quite the same kind of bad right rape and sexual assault are not the same thing as sexual harassment and conflating the two actually ends up making light of sexual assault because it allows people to slough it off it allows people to basically say okay you know that's the same as saying something nasty look sexually harassing a woman and sexually assaulting a woman are not quite the same thing they're both bad but there are different levels of bad right it's bad - it's bad to hit a child it's worse to kill a child right it's bad - it's bad to yell at somebody it's much worse to hit somebody so I think that we need to be careful about the standards that we apply and also the credibility of particular of particular standards the reason that I've been so harsh on Roy Moore is because I find the allegations particularly credible because they're supporting details it's the reason I found one Nina Broderick to be credible I think they're supporting details she was in the place she said she was at the time she said she was there were contemporaneous people that she had told at the time but I think that one of the things that that is going to happen now is the the hysteria is is so loud and so much that there's the possibility that we're gonna jump to conclusions we shouldn't jump to conclusions I've called for a certain level of credibility but I think that we should determine for ourselves what exactly that level of credibility is in other words I'm calm I'm calling for a standard because otherwise sexual harassment sexual abuse these are just gonna become clubs that you can wield against the other side rather than a real attempt to cleanse the Society of a grave evil is so so just wanted I think that's that's worth worth commenting upon other comment that I don't wanna make so yesterday I tweeted something and all these feminists went nuts because they didn't understand what I was saying I tweeted that it seems like the only solution here is robot politicians I was not specifically speaking about sexual harassment I'm saying all of our politicians suck and a lot of politicians are willing to cover for people who suck okay Kirsten Gillibrand is one of them she came out yesterday and she said the bill clinton should have resigned in 1998 she was literally campaigning with him six months ago so no okay it's all of our politicians are garbage you may get less sexual harassment if women they're more women in Congress I think you probably would but that doesn't mean that the legislation would be any better or that they wouldn't cover for bad behavior okay that's just the reality of the situation we as society have abandoned a particular moral standard and that moral stand that comes with consequences okay none of this arises in a vacuum sexual harassment sexual abuse these have always happened but we also used to have certain standards of behavior that we demanded from our politicians and that we demanded from people more generally now we live in a society where those standards don't exist unless we almost randomly decide that they exist again so that's not a consistent standard or or don't have a standard at all but don't don't this were this kind of pick and choose routine is a very dangerous for the heart of our politics double standards don't work okay before I go any further and I want to get to some things I like and

just go to some some things i like and some things that I hate cuz I really I always kind of give short shrift to the mailbag and I don't want to do that this week so things I like and things that I hate so we'll start with things I like yes on the plane I had some very long flights and I got to watch a couple of movies one was Wind River the other one that I saw was the lost city of Z the marketing campaign for this movie was really quite terrible one of the reasons the marketing campaign was terrible is if you looked at some of the original posters it was not clear this was a period piece this is a better poster for the lost city of Z makes clear that this is a period piece about exploration it is also true that the title of the film is really bad it shouldn't be called the lost city of Z they should have called it the Explorer or something you know something that that actually the the interest of the film is not really in the search for velocity of Z it's really in the biography of the of the central character of the film when the performances in this film are actually quite good I'm not a big Charlie Hunnam fan I find him a nerd but Robert Pattinson gives a terrific performance I didn't know Robert Pattinson could act as Malthus was pointing out to me before the show both Robert Pattinson and Kristen and Kristen Stewart can act but as Donald Trump said she treated him like a dog and she'll do it again just watch so Robert Pattinson is very very good in this movie uh then the movie is about an explorer named Fossett and he is searching for this city in the Amazon he thinks that there is this lost city in the Amazon this sort of city of gold and he goes searching for it and he sort of leaves his wife and children behind his wife's play by sea on a Miller who's quite good in the film and all the performances actually across the board except for hums are pretty good so here is a here's a little bit of the preview to dream to seek the unknown to look for what is beautiful is its own reward a man's reach should exceed his grasp or what's a heaven you are their Explorer even your hand I wish to find a lost city what do you seek is far greater and you ever imagined okay so the the preview is you can see it's beautifully directed it's really well acted it's really Oscar bait and it's been largely ignored it didn't do any sort of business at the theater so far as I can tell even though it's got a bunch of big-name actors and a really big budget and it's beautifully shot there's a whole world war one sequence that's really well done so it's it's it's well worth watching it is not an uplifting film it sort of tries to be and it sort of tries to be politically correct at the same time there are few kind of politically correct tropes in there but it's well we're for watching okay so I have more things that I like and some things that I hate in the mailbag but for that you're gonna have to go over to Daley wire comm and subscribe

podcast in the nation all righty so a couple of other things that I like so I'm trying to do a little more things I like this week because the news has been just such a dumpster it's just been terrible and speaking of bad news it's now breaking that it looks like the tax the tax reform bill is at least on the rope Senator Ron Johnson has said he's not gonna vote for it as it currently stands Lisa Murkowski saying she's not gonna vote for as it currently stands so they're basically one one vote away from the thing collapsing so but but let's do some good news okay so this I thought was just super cute so this came from ABC News there's a little five-year-old kid who's coming back from kindergarten on the school bus and his three-year-old sister is waiting for him and this is just adorable if you can't see it he's just giving her a big hug and carrying around and then they're walking home Nia it's super cute so as a parent of two this is the best thing the worst thing in the world as a parent is when your kids are beating the crap out of each other it's really it's really hard to watch but when my when my daughter my who's older she's three and a half when she treats my son really well and when he when she gets half of the more he loves her I mean he's obsessed with her like she she gets up in the morning he gets up earlier than she does and then her name is Leah he goes yeah yeah and then he runs into her room because he loves her so much and then you know she'll give him a big hug it's the cutest thing in the world so this kind of stuff is really fantastic apparently they used to fight a lot and now that he went to school she realizes what she's missing and she's happy when her brother comes home so that's it that's just cute stuff okay other things that are that I like so Orrin Hatch senator from Utah finally lost with sherrod Brown shirt brown his senator from Ohio and just a terrible terrible senator and he was ripping on the tax reform bill suggesting that it hurts the middle class which is absolutely untrue the vast vast vast vast vast majority of Americans in particular in the middle class got a tax cut from this bill and Orrin Hatch basically laid the wood to sherrod Brown for suggesting otherwise I come from the poor people and I've been here working my whole second career for people who don't have a chance and I really resent anybody saying that I'm just doing this for the rich give me a break I think you guys overplay that all the time and it gets old and frankly Yatta Yatta quit mister share of the public leave suggest I'm not true okay I get kind of sick and tired of it not true it's a nice political play well mr. Jeremiah all due respect I get sick and tired of the richest regular order we do attack and over and over again - how many times do we do this okay and then hatch went off on him some more so you know again it is a really tired talking point this idea that it's the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer there's no evidence of that the poor have gotten richer the rich have gotten richer over the past thirty years for sure and the idea that that tax cuts solely benefit the people at the top of the spectrum is just not truth considering that the people at the top of the spectrum are paying nearly all of the net income tax in the United States okay time for some things I hate animal mail back it up okay so a couple of quick things that I hate so Hillary Clinton yesterday she was asked about an investigation into her and why is she still here like why she's still bothering everyone she's she's someone suggested that she sort of become the rick astley of politics but you just got rickrolled into into playing videos of hillary clinton i think that's basically correct also she apparently shops in in the wardrobe fashioned by maria in by julie andrews in sound of music like she gets all of her clothes made from curtains in any case here's a here's hillary clinton talking about why an investigation into her would be an abuse of power if I try to take myself out of it which you know is kind of hard because it's personally offensive that they would do this but taking myself out of it this is such an abuse of power and it goes right at the rule of law okay so it goes at the rule of law and she's investigated but it doesn't go against the rule of law when Jim Comey of the FBI coordinates with the Obama administration to let her off without evidence yeah that so I love this for Hillary it's an abuse of power when she is investigated but not an abuse of power when she's led off for no reason that's really exciting also I don't understand why she's wearing like a necklace made from balls from a ball crawl like giggles and hugs that's confusing too okay so enough making fun of Hillary's wardrobe let's make fun of art so there is a there's a Christie's there's a Christie's Auction the other day and there are a couple of pieces of work that went for a lot of money so there was a da Vinci painting of Jesus that went for four hundred and fifty million dollars which suggests that somebody has too much money on their hands and it doesn't look like Jesus it looks kind of like the Mona Lisa with a beard it's not it's not good but that was not the bad painting the worst painting was this okay so there an artist I guess an inside Twombley now I will acknowledge I don't know much about modern art mainly because I think most modern art is supreme garbage but side Twombly is is a modern artist who executed a series called the Bacchus series who really deep really meaningful ok this painting apparently sold yesterday or a couple days ago for 40 million dollars for 4-0 million dollars okay do you see this painting do you see this my one and a half year old made this for my fridge yesterday okay that's what this looks like it's a bunch of swirlies with paint but to care the genius of it my yeah okay if this is worth 40 million dollars then I can crap something out worth 10 okay that's that's insane so yeah I just want to read you from Christie's because Christie's was marketing it this way collectively marking the culmination of 12 at least 50 years of painterly practice the series comprises three distinct sets the first of these six eight feet high portrait forming paintings was completed in 2004 towering over the viewer at more than 10 feet high and 16 feet wide how'd you like to walk into your house and this is the entire wall if this happened I would immediately spank my son if they'd actually I wouldn't he's great but I would repaint the wall I mean for God's sake like if this is this is your entire wall it looks like Charles Manson's been inside your house ridiculous says on November 15th the masterwork will lead the post-war and contemporary art evening sale at Christie's in New York it was executed using a pole too which was affixed to brush drenched in richer 4,000,000 paints it's bright red spiral seems to both climb and fall Twombly allowed each of his marks to run down the canvas suggesting the dripping of wine or blood or like paint right says the paintings basic looping motif was a recurring theme in trombley's art this form fascinated him for several years in the meandering scroll of the blackboard paintings of the late 1960s he explored its capacity to convey through repetition a sense of single continuous field of energy here Twombly revisited and developed this line in an epic scale this is such bull okay this is it like I'm sorry this is garbage and the idea that everything is art okay you want to call this art call it art okay but it's finger painting it's bad art okay then that's it not to get into deep philosophy here about art but one of the things that makes art art is a certain amount of skill to be an artist means that you have perfected your craft right there's a difference between somebody like me who's very good at violin and somebody who's legitimately virtuosic on violin and the difference is that person has more craft than I do I've talked about art and craft before I've talked about the idea that craft will requires skill and what I hate about modern art is that it's much more about energy and it's all subjective right I think that you can say I think that you can objectively say this is bad art I think there are certain objective standards and I think one of the standards you can apply is how many people on earth could make this how many people on earth could make this everyone every person can make this okay there's no one there elephants that can make this at the zoo they legitimately have zoos where two elephants like make are then they sell them for like 15 bucks and it supports the the survival of the elephants that seems to be a much better spend than side Twombly's art the the the leftist can the leftist idea that subjectivity creates its own value is so stupid then I can't even believe it now listen if somebody does this mean that the person who bought it has too much money not necessarily it means that the person who bought it has terrible taste but the but the idea that art has no standards whatsoever is the death of everything right it's true in music we look at people who play three chords and suddenly they're Beethoven we look at people who rhyme badly and suddenly they're there Shakespeare the whole purpose of art is that you are supposed to be better at something than anyone else and no other arena of American life or Western life do we treat people like this only in the artistic field do we do this right you never do this with a plumber you never would be like the plumber wouldn't come in and screw up your pipes you'd be like you know what he really used his creativity there you know I can take a hammer and beat on that pipe and it gives me a new sense of meaning like art is a job yeah art requires skill this is why all of the great artists spent years an apprenticeship they spent years perfecting their craft if you got if I see something where I got up in the morning and all I would have to do is basically spit on his canvas and this would now be art it makes me angry and I think it's stupid okay and the person who bought it is moron how rich they are okay time for the mailbag so Benjamin writes dear Ben what books do you recommend for a novice in the study of economic ideologies then easily explain the errors of socialism and communism thank you well Hayek has a couple of books the that are that are quite book that are quite good on this the name of the Hayek book that is most famous road to serfdom that's the one that it sort of explains the the failures of socialist economics economics in one lesson is always the easiest economics book and it explains why Keynesianism is wrong there there are a number of very good books Thomas sells books on basic economics explain it as well pal says do you practice the infamous Shapiro smirk in the mirror before your debates if I were to give it a name like blue steel what would you call it well I mean I don't actually have a name for it I don't practice it it's been natural since childhood I assume there are certain kind of facial tics that everyone has and that's just one of mine the other one that I have is what I'm thinking I tend to kind of roll my eyes a little bit and I've been working on that one because it annoys me and my wife but I don't have a name for it we'll have to we'll have to come up with one so if you have any suggestions Kyle we are perfectly willing to take those under advisement Lamberto says hi Ben recently I posted on Facebook and exercise describing the horrible situation in Venezuela due to their socialist policies in response to that article liberal friend of mine commented saying Venezuela is a bad example of socialism and Germany is a good example of socialism why can't the u.s. be as effective as Germany I didn't know exactly how to counter that statement perhaps you can help me out well actually Venezuela is a better example of socialism since it has more government running of resources so socialism and communism are based on state ownership of resources if you want to talk about heavy regulation and redistribution of resources that really is less socialism than it is what they call sort of modified capitalism Germany is much more along those lines than it is like Germany is closer in economics to the United States than it is to Venezuela and the idea that because Germany has extensive social programs that it is that it is a socialist country is just not true in the same way that people say Denmark is a socialist country except that it has some of the lowest corporate tax rates on planet earth and some of the and some of the Laxus business regulations say very high personal income tax rates and they have a social safety net that's very extensive they've had to cut all of that back because they're bankrupting themselves so even Germany isn't a good example of how you can have a lasting success like Germany has had some economic success in the European context compared their economy of the United States it's not even close Cedric says hey Ben do you think there is any political and moral issue on which the left is closer to the truth than the right well it depends on which elements of the right you are talking about so I would say this there are certain elements of the right that sort of our libertarian in orientation not with regards to government which i think is right but with regards to human nature this idea that we are all atomistic individuals and that any social standards are dangerous and there is no communal social fabric you know the left acknowledges that there's a social fabric they just think that the government has to force what the social fabric is so if I have to choose between the idea that there is a social fabric and there is no social fabric or the social fabric doesn't matter then I think the social fabric matters I don't think so you know in terms of in terms of sort of the role of social fabric it goes like this libertarians are here and then there's left and then there's the right over here so the left is actually closer to the right in terms of communitarian ideology with regard to social fabric then hardcore libertarianism but as far as generalized leftist ideology I don't think so very much alex says what's your favorite food to eat during Thanksgiving so stuffing is my thing I will I will put away you like entire pans and stuffing they are stuffing that my mom makes an incredible Turkey in fact no I phonetic along the way for Thanksgiving but we are doing Thanksgiving dinner in evening early because we need to have my mom's cooking my mom is an excellent cook mark says God Emperor Shapiro that's that's flattering I guess that clayman's been to post I run a free speech group on my campus what is the best what would you say is the best way to deal with the radical leftist who try to silence us and heckle our events expose them get out of camera and show them being idiots and then get it to Daily wire and we will put that up and we will mock them because that is one of our joys in life Emilio says hey is beer kosher and if so what's your beer of choice so I'm not I can't say I'm like a beer connoisseur plain beer is always kosher because it's made from grain it's not made from grapes flavored beer is not always kosher usually when I'm out I'll order something with a Heineken or something Kyle says according to modern science humans been around for about a hundred thousand years but the Bible states we've been here for about seven thousand years what's your opinion on that on an evolution in general so I am NOT a a fundamentalist with regard to timelines in the Bible particularly in the creation period so there's a book that I a lot by a guy named Gerald Schroeder I've recommended it on the show before talking about how science melds with the Bible I mean some obvious criticisms of the of the literalist interpretation of biblical dating pretty clearly for example the the Bible says at the very beginning there was there was night and there was day the first day that happens before the earth has been created before the Sun has been created so what is the timeline there's that really a 24-hour period or is it something very different so I don't think that the the Bible was meant to be taken supremely literally along those lines but if you're conveying I'm not sure how you would convey that the earth is hundreds of thousands of years old and evolution existed in a document that was that was created 3,000 years ago for people who had no idea what evolution is I had no idea what species were had no idea about periods of time I mean how to explain carbon dating so you know I think that God has a bit of a rough road to hoe in terms of communication with human beings he's always bound by the capacity of human beings to understand which is pretty clear even from the biblical text when Moses said to God let me see her face and God says I can't let you see my face Gerald I I think that's pretty much correct in perfect communication between God and man is not a real possibility in the sense that everything is always going to be filtered through the prism of the mind and God knows that Josh says if the founders were alive today to see what America has become what do you think they might wish they could go back and change or do differently well I think that the the problem well I mean listen I think if the founders were alive today and you know many of them were not raised in a context in which slavery was appropriate they would abolish slavery right off the bat I think that they would also be a little bit less sanguine about the power of the judiciary I think that they would also tremendously oppose the power of the bureaucracy and they would put restrictions in the Constitution against it but the Constitution is a pretty good document I'm not sure what exactly they would change in order prohibit what happened because all of the all of the problems of the Constitution in terms of government growth have been specifically variations from the Constitution so that's not because the founders embedded anything in there that's wrong they might have taken some of the anti-federalists critiques a little bit more seriously about the possibility of growth and federal power but it's also important to recognize that at the time they were fighting against the Articles of Confederation which were the weakest form of government known to man essentially Ryan says you've spoken about voting for representation versus voting for morality which rather have a social Saints in office or questionable conservatives so the idea here is that you are you know should you vote for somebody who is moral but disagrees with you or should you vote for somebody who is questionable but agrees with you so I again I'm going to reject the false binary that we live in a system where we can select immoral men who agree with us but if but if the false binary is what I'd rather have people who are who are personally Saints but vote for socialism versus what I rather have people who are child molesters but are but but agree with me if that is the false binary we are creating of course you would have to say that you would vote for the person who most represents your priorities I get that but I don't think that that's the binary and I don't think that that is a recipe for for a repeat election cycle so here's one of the things that that I said about the 2016 election I'll say it again about Alabama elections do not exist in a vacuum they're not one time event the idea that how you vote in this election impacts how the country moves in future elections is a fact the moral character of a country is built off of repeated trials and errors okay you don't get to take one election and take it and crystallize it and say this is the only election that has ever mattered in the history of the world when you do that you ends up in a world of false binaries and that's how you end up with a bunch of bad choices I think that how you vote in elections how you decide this makes a difference so if you were to ask me is it worth sacrificing one election so we can have a better country where there's the possibility that everyone requires good people to be in office and so next time my choice isn't between a questionable conservative and a socialist ain't is between a socialist and a conservative st. then that's something that I would that I think it's worth sacrificing for I think that I think that if we if we all hold by that standard then we'll have more saints in office and fewer sinners and more sane to agree with us in office and fewer sinners who agree with us in office so you know the whole premise of my logic on this politically is that sometimes you have to take a short-term loss in order to make a long term gain but I think that we live in an era where if you think that we can't take a short term loss it's the end of the world if we lose something or at the end it's the or that even the possibility of losing means that we have to vote a certain way everything is crisis point a lot of exigent circumstances require you to make bad decisions and I think that that's where we are repeatedly in politics and I don't that's where we ought to be Ryan says sorry I just read his Lynn says Ben if you were given the tasks were in a high school without the Department of Education getting in your way what would you be teaching the students in Y so I would be inculcating virtue so I would spend some time actually talking about the virtues and why they are important in pursuing human happiness this is something that we don't teach in high schools anymore I would also be pushing apprenticeships as opposed to particular classes in in certain study areas I think the learning skill sets is actually a lot more important sometimes than learning knowledge that you may never use so but virtue is is my is my key component I'll be teaching people that happiness is reliant on you being a virtuous human being and here are the ways that you can make your life more enlightened and more virtuous Austen says by the way the founders agree the founders agreed with me George Washington talked routinely about this being the role of education in a free society a society that does not inculcate virtue in the young is likely to crumble when they're old Austin says hi Ben is refusing funding to sanctuary cities against the law if not how a judge is able to block these executive actions so no it's not against the law the the basic rule I believe is that the federal funding must be tied to something that has to do with it being a sanctuary City so this was ruled during I believe the Reagan era because Reagan tried to remove federal funding from certain states that were that were not cracking down on drunk driving in the way that he wanted and so what they said is that the funding that he's removing has to be somehow logically connected to the cause that he's attempting to push you can't just randomly remove all funding for a cause that is unrelated Michael says what is the greater overarching cause and problem that the sexual assault charges stem from thanks and love the show on true allegiance especially your signature ones and will belong to my son well I appreciate it Michael he's so the greater overarching cause that the sexual assault charges stem from is again failures teach virtue teaching boys not to rape is easy but if it has no context if you're not supposed to tea if you're not teaching boys an affirmative virtue then they're likely to fall into temptation more often the same thing is true for young women who are being told that is it listen sexual assault is not the fault of women it's the fault of the people who do the sexual assaulting but you're increasing risk when you tell people that a libertine sexual order in which consent is the only value is likely to lead to happiness that leads to risk you're in counters okay again the evil is the fault of the evildoer the riskier encounters are likely to increase the prep or the proportion of encounters in which an evil event happens Roderick says Ben would you please explain that neutrality I've done that before so I'm gonna skip that one you can look back at previous podcasts because I have talked about that at length Christian says hey Ben I'm a big show up fan of the show from Switzerland I was wondering is there any way in which the US could learn from the Swiss health care system I know it cost us a lot of money but it seems to be working very well with the individual mandate why hasn't the us considered such reform so Christian as you may have seen in my debate when I say if you're gonna have a government-run system it should look like the Swiss health care system I think that's right but I don't think that a government-run health care system is the best health care system so Switzerland provides universality and quality but not affordability it cost a fortune it's very very expensive in Switzerland but is the United States willing to absorb those costs I'm not sure the United States is willing to absorb those costs also you need to worry about the creation of new products and services as opposed to the redistribution of existing ones and in a capitalist market is the best way to do that okay so final question here Braden's has been I'm 22 years old married making a good living my wife wants a baby as do I however I'm afraid to be at a because I didn't have one growing up and don't have all great reference points to go out for my youth what if any is your advice on this well Braden I think that the fact that you acknowledge this is a problem is one of the reasons why it sounds to me like you're gonna be in good shape to advocate recognizing your own flaws as a person recognizing your own shortcomings in your childhood things you want to do better is a great way to raise kids because it means they're gonna be thinking yeah I've said this about I say this to people all the time if you're truly worried about sin if you're truly concerned about your own level of sinfulness you are less likely to sin than if you're blind about your sin and if you're truly worried about making mistakes that means you're gonna think twice before you make those mistakes so what I would say is that you sound I think you and your wife sounds like would make very good parents and you know if you're looking for great reference points then try to find people who you think are great parents get close to them and try to learn from them and try to put yourself in situations where you can learn from other men you admire so the day my dad always said this when I was growing up that he liked to have friends where I could look up to them also and admire them when people who treated me well as well I think that you can do that too and I think that be a worthwhile thing okay so we will be back here on Monday hopefully the world home on Tim in our absence it's gonna be Thanksgiving week next week so let's try to have a happy week that'd be nice have a great weekend I mention Pierrot this is the Ben Shapiro show
