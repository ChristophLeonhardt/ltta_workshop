00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,930
firstly I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to refer to many</font>

17
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,879
comments that were made on last week's

18
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,580
episode which was about nuclear energy

19
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,510
and how you can in fact have forms of it

20
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,290
where there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no harmful white waste</font>

21
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,630
and it's therefore clean I wasn't

22
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,490
denying that I was just saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

23
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,970
you put geothermal energy alongside

24
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:23,100
nuclear energy that geothermal energy is

25
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,740
a lot better to use that was the only

26
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,280
point I was making<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok question one comes</font>

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,189
from Scripture who asks on tumblr hey

28
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:34,619
are there sources you can share for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

29
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,119
reading technique you mentioned in your

30
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,140
latest video I'm very<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in it</font>

31
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,030
well it's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> reading genius by a man</font>

32
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,189
called ed stretcher and<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually I've</font>

33
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:46,680
just got it here this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just got</font>

34
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,829
this off my friend alex day who borrowed

35
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:51,299
this off me I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

36
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,250
used that he had it for about three

37
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,409
years and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually quite</font>

38
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:58,770
obsolete because you got the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tapes there</font>

39
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,140
the HS and also there are cassettes on

40
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,560
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if I would recommend</font>

41
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">buying it because it is very expensive</font>

42
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:08,520
slowly if you really do have the

43
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,889
disposable income there but I'd say

44
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,050
research into it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot first and i made</font>

45
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,830
a video

46
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,590
on it in future basically it encourages

47
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,300
you to be more confident in what you're

48
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,700
reading it has music that slows down

49
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,120
your brainwaves because children are the

50
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,640
best learners because from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a young age</font>

51
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,320
your brainwaves are a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> slower and</font>

52
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,120
that's why you can in take much more

53
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,720
information and it's the notion<font color="#CCCCCC"> that by</font>

54
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,020
reading faster down the page instead of

55
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,570
across your brains more excited and

56
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,790
therefore can take more information it's

57
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,650
that notion of if you could drive 10

58
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,690
miles per<font color="#CCCCCC"> hour on a road or a hundred</font>

59
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">miles per hour 100 miles probably much</font>

60
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,240
more exciting much more fast and that's

61
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,810
kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> premise for how that works</font>

62
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,600
number two can dl fern asks on<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube</font>

63
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,630
what are your thoughts on next year's

64
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,580
2012 london olympics waste of time money

65
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,480
and effort or part of a legacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

66
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,130
it's a bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> both and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know they say</font>

67
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's good for the economy i don't think</font>

68
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,450
the transport in<font color="#CCCCCC"> London's gonna be able</font>

69
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">to cope with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it I don't know if I'm</font>

70
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,260
gonna be able to get into work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

71
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">been so crazy so then if it will be that</font>

72
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">great for the economy and it's that</font>

73
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,400
whole thing of why pay so much money to

74
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">go see these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people running around a</font>

75
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,780
track when you can see it in much better

76
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,459
quality and high definition on

77
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,230
television at home which will be much

78
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,890
cheaper but maybe I sound cynical I mean

79
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,930
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a skeptic I guess and it's the</font>

80
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,280
same of anything in life if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're same</font>

81
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,489
its traditional you'll sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of look down</font>

82
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:46,440
upon by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> status quo for um for not</font>

83
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,760
going with the tradition you know I'll

84
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,670
cheer up it is it's good but I think

85
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,500
just the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money the billions</font>

86
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,390
and billions of spent on it I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

87
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,920
think it's justified however now the

88
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,110
money has been spent let's make the most

89
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,690
of it but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's like christmas</font>

90
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,310
christmas i just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend time with</font>

91
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,680
family the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> presence thing doesn't</font>

92
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,300
appeal to me anymore and again people

93
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,320
say oh miles you've been so miserable

94
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,370
you know just<font color="#CCCCCC"> because things traditional</font>

95
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,260
doesn't mean it's right you know we

96
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">should be able to grow out of things and</font>

97
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think we should go out the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> olympics</font>

98
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,488
because although sport is great<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font>

99
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:22,410
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it justifies the amount of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money</font>

100
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,250
that was spent on it

101
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:28,520
question 3 comes from working backward

102
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,370
who asks on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter what can I do to</font>

103
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,199
convince my school to let you talk there

104
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,659
now this is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a</font>

105
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:40,610
UK lecture tool in 2012 firstly just get

111
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,719
it's going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be about and then i can</font>

112
00:04:56,719 --> 00:04:58,550
send that to you to then take to your

113
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,199
school and if it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be organized</font>

114
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,930
brilliant<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can come along and hopefully</font>

119
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,500
there's a related question here number

120
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,349
four from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brad who asks on facebook what</font>

121
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:20,360
sort of things would you talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about for</font>

122
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,449
your tour of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the nation it primarily be</font>

123
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,039
about my experiences of using the

124
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,069
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> because my internet experiences</font>

125
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:30,860
have revolved around many facets of the

126
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,830
establishment the education system

127
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,840

entertainment all these sort of things

130
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:45,229
I'm activism and therefore I talk about

131
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:46,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">my personal experiences and how the</font>

132
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:50,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet can empower anyone to do what</font>

133
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,190
they wish to achieve I'd also then talk

134
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,440
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest problems we face in</font>

135
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,629
society and what the potential solutions

136
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:58,639
are to it just to give another

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">perspective that is most most unlikely</font>

138
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:06,770
to be taught in school right now so yeah

139
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,289
but this this may evolve as I start

140
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:10,849
putting my notes together of exactly

141
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:12,860
what I wish<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about and if there's</font>

142
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,849
anything else you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I should be</font>

143
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:15,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about on these lectures please</font>

00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,490
script a word of advice because it was

157
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,460
about me and my perceptions of the world

158
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,700
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a big challenge that we had to</font>

159
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,910
deal with before it was too late but

160
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">before going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on youtube I'd actually</font>

161
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,440
tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> together a film trailer</font>

162
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,230
like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mock-up of what the film would</font>

163
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,240
look like if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was if it was a</font>

164
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,130
feature-length and there was a trailer

165
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:17,690
for it so it's sort of like a an example

166
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,900
construct of that and I needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> money to</font>

167
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,160
make that happens there was a film

168
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming that was going to help me out and</font>

169
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,360
therefore to raise money they put on a

170
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,690
gig a show in my local town and enter

171
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,490
shikari offered to play<font color="#CCCCCC"> for free which</font>

172
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,980
they did to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> raise money</font>

173
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately the project never went</font>

174
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,680
through which is why I then went to

175
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,590
youtube and it was as a story goes I

176
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">went to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube realizing why do I need</font>

177
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">to use a film script as my vehicle for</font>

178
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,610
ideas when I can just<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk like this and</font>

179
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,990
actually over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past five years enter</font>

180
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,270
shikari have taken similar paths to me

181
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,390
with identifying problems in society and

182
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,170
what the solutions are<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jealous in a</font>

183
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,730
good way i would love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in a band</font>

184
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:03,630
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to be in a band with</font>

185
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,120
people who can play heavy music but with

186
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,270
some electronic stuff in there so if

187
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,470
there's any musicians out there they

188
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,330
want to collab with me let's get going

189
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,070
because I've so many<font color="#CCCCCC"> lyrics I just need</font>

190
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:18,630
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> music to put it with so yeah it's</font>

191
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:23,850
cool ah question<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 if i pronounce this</font>

192
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:26,610
right iron lucky kid asks on youtube

193
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,880
what's your opinion on drug prohibition

194
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,380
um<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm just going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> throw it out there</font>

195
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,330
quite simply just to generate discussion

196
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:40,229
but my main thought is by legalizing all

197
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:42,870
drugs you you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of most of the</font>

198
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,010
problems that come with it right now

199
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,200
because the war the war on drugs is

200
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,160
failing

201
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,470
is plenty of statistics to show that

202
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,529
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> M I'll get together someday</font>

203
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:57,100
improbably to the video on it just

204
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,079
identify any problem that comes with

205
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:01,629
drugs and think about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would</font>

206
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:04,149
change if it was legalized so you know

207
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:08,019
crime the black<font color="#E5E5E5"> market</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that'd be</font>

208
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:09,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">eradicated if it was legalized because</font>

209
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:11,740
the government could do it if the

210
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,269
government did it it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

211
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:16,060
drugs would be much cleaner it would be

212
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:20,110
regulated you could then<font color="#E5E5E5"> tax it and the</font>

213
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">revenue from tax could then go to fund</font>

214
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:25,209
health care for people that need health

215
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:27,519
care due to drug habits and all this

216
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,259
sort of stuff people would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more</font>

217
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:31,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">willing to get help for their drug</font>

218
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:33,670
problems because they'd be less worried

219
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:38,350
about getting sidelined or arrested for

220
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,500
illegal usage I've had a personal

221
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,000
experience where I was in a part of town

222
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">where it was renowned for selling</font>

223
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,389
marijuana and the police never<font color="#E5E5E5"> tackled</font>

224
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:52,120
it fully because by leaving that one

225
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,680
area of town to drug dealing they always

226
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,970
knew where it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they could</font>

227
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,560
monitor if they got rid of it it would

228
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">just go elsewhere and then the chase</font>

229
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,889
would begin again which kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of shows</font>

230
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:05,709
you how the war on drugs is failing but

231
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:06,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">there would be people that pull up there</font>

232
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,920
in four by fours<font color="#CCCCCC"> mothers with kids in</font>

233
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,500
the car businessman with sports cars

234
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,380
homeless<font color="#CCCCCC"> people kids people with all</font>

235
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,540
different backgrounds drugs isn't a

236
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,339
class thing it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with people</font>

237
00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:20,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">with particular backgrounds people from</font>

238
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,199
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> walks of life get involved in drugs</font>

239
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:25,990
and I think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know by</font>

240
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:30,459
making it more public oh that's my time

241
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:33,189
up just to finish and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just think by</font>

242
00:10:33,189 --> 00:10:34,870
legalizing it you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get rid of</font>

243
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,209
most those problems and make<font color="#E5E5E5"> more people</font>

244
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:39,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">more willing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal with it because if</font>

245
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,899
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the one the drugs that is</font>

246
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:42,550
the biggest killer out there and most

247
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,850
destructive to society it's alcohol but

248
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,529
it's legal so we kind of treat it

249
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:49,540
differently you know and there have been

250
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,779
scientists who have been employed by the

251
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:54,850
government to<font color="#E5E5E5"> advise him who listed up</font>

252
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,889
drugs based on how damaging they are to

253
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:59,250
health and they said you know

254
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,470
alcohol should be a class I ecstasy

255
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,420
should be legal and they were sacked by

256
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,650
the government because it didn't fit

257
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:08,070
with their political agenda what does

258
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,560
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> say to you so thank you for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

259
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,200
questions um hopefully it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

260
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,570
this week and I guess I will see on

261
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,310
another episode of eye of the storm in

262
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,350
the new year have a good Christmas I

263
00:11:19,350 --> 00:00:00,000
have a happy new year<font color="#E5E5E5"> bye</font>
