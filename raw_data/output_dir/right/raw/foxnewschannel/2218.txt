AND THEN A DEMOCRAT AGAIN, AND

00:00:16,781 --> 00:00:18,583
THEN ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO YOU

10
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:19,283
BECAME A REPUBLICAN AGAIN, SO

21
00:00:37,836 --> 00:00:38,136
FIRST.

22
00:00:38,136 --> 00:00:40,472
BARACK OBAMA DEVASTATED OUR

23
00:00:40,472 --> 00:00:42,073

24
00:00:42,073 --> 00:00:45,377
PUT LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF COAL

THE SECOND AMENDMENT.

30
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:54,853
THE WEST VIRGINIA STORY IS THAT

31
00:00:54,853 --> 00:00:58,190
WE ARE A PROUD RED STATE.

32
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,591
LOOK IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY

DONALD TRUMP WON WEST VIRGINIA

34
00:01:00,992 --> 00:01:01,993
BY 77 POINTS.

35
00:01:01,993 --> 00:01:07,432
HE WON THE GENERAL OF 44 POINTS.

36
00:01:07,432 --> 00:01:08,100
DONALD TRUMP WAS A DEMOCRAT.

37
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,803
RONALD REAGAN WAS A DEMOCRAT.

38
00:01:10,803 --> 00:01:12,371
IT IS A PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW THEIR

39
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:13,872

40
00:01:13,872 --> 00:01:15,974
FIRST RATHER THAN THEIR PARTY

41
00:01:15,974 --> 00:01:16,408

42
00:01:16,408 --> 00:01:17,943
I SIMPLY COULD NOT BE A PART OF

43
00:01:17,943 --> 00:01:18,977
A DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT WAS SO

44
00:01:18,977 --> 00:01:21,413
WRONG FOR WEST VIRGINIA, SO

45
00:01:21,413 --> 00:01:23,782
WRONG FOR WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE

46
00:01:23,782 --> 00:01:24,116

47
00:01:24,116 --> 00:01:25,384

53
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:34,660
THAT IS AN EASY CHOICE FOR ME.

54
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,394
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I WILL

00:01:35,394 --> 00:01:36,996

HAVE GOTTEN BEHIND ME.

ESTIMATE COST WEST VIRGINIA

193
00:05:38,775 --> 00:05:39,776
NEARLY $1 BILLION IN LOST

194
00:05:39,776 --> 00:05:40,477
PRODUCTIVITY AND RESOURCES TO

195
00:05:40,477 --> 00:05:45,349
ADDRESS THE ISSUE.

196
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:46,216
>> Martha: CONGRESSMAN

197
00:05:46,216 --> 00:05:48,018
JENKINS, REPRESENTING

198

WEST VIRGINIA FOR 24 YEARS,

199
00:05:50,287 --> 00:05:52,556
SMALL TOWNS BOTH IN YOUR

200
00:05:52,556 --> 00:05:54,458
DISTRICT HAVE BEEN FLOODED WITH

201
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,393
ENOUGH HYDROCODONE AND OXYCODONE

202
00:05:56,393 --> 00:05:57,761
TO SUPPLY THOUSANDS OF PILLS TO

203
00:05:57,761 --> 00:05:59,763
EVERY MAN, WOMAN, AND CHILD.

204
00:05:59,763 --> 00:06:02,199
SO WHAT MAKES YOU BELIEVE THAT

205
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,500
YOU DESERVE A PROMOTION WHEN THE

206
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,370
DISTRICT THAT YOU REPRESENT IS

207
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,972
GROUND ZERO FOR THE OPIOID

208
00:06:07,972 --> 00:06:08,305
CRISIS?

209
00:06:08,305 --> 00:06:10,174
>> WE HAVE BEEN MAKING A REAL

210
00:06:10,174 --> 00:06:10,574
DIFFERENCE.

211
00:06:10,574 --> 00:06:12,776
WE ARE SEEING PROGRESS.

212
00:06:12,776 --> 00:06:14,778
WE HAVE HERE TWO LADIES THAT

213
00:06:14,778 --> 00:06:16,981
CALLED ME FIVE YEARS AGO, SARAH

214
00:06:16,981 --> 00:06:19,784
AND RHONDA, TWO NURSES THAT SAW

215
00:06:19,784 --> 00:06:21,752
THE PRECIOUS NEWBORN BABIES THAT

216
00:06:21,752 --> 00:06:23,354
HAVE BEEN DRUG EXPOSED DURING

217
00:06:23,354 --> 00:06:24,889
PREGNANCY AND THROUGH THE LABOR

218
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:27,491
OF LOVE, RHONDA, SARAH, ME AND

219
00:06:27,491 --> 00:06:29,193
SOME OTHERS STARTED LILLY’S

220
00:06:29,193 --> 00:06:35,366
PLACE, A FACILITY THAT MELANIA

221
00:06:35,366 --> 00:06:36,768
TRUMP VISITED GIVING EVERY CHILD

222
00:06:36,768 --> 00:06:37,969
A START IN LIFE.

223
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:39,404
AND I LOVE TALKING ABOUT THE

224
00:06:39,404 --> 00:06:41,839
FLOOD OF OPIOIDS, PATRICK

225
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,311
MORRISEY AND HIS FAMILY LOBBYING

226
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:48,746
IN WASHINGTON, D.C.,

227
00:06:48,746 --> 00:06:49,547
CARDINAL HEALTH, NOT OUR STATE

228
00:06:49,547 --> 00:06:51,749
TO BIRD, IT IS THE PUSHER OF ALL

229
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:55,153
OF THESE PILLS.

230
00:06:55,153 --> 00:06:57,555
HE AND HIS FAMILY LOBBYING FIRM

231
00:06:57,555 --> 00:06:59,424
HAVE MADE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS

232
00:06:59,424 --> 00:07:02,394
IN HIS 18 YEARS AS A D.C.

LOBBYIST AND HILL STAFFORD.

234
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:07,365
THEY HAVE FLOODED OUR STATE WITH

235
00:07:07,365 --> 00:07:09,568
THESE PAIN PILLS THAT HAVE

236
00:07:09,568 --> 00:07:10,135
DEVASTATED PEOPLE IN

237
00:07:10,135 --> 00:07:10,569
WEST VIRGINIA.

238
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:12,537
IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT THE

239
00:07:12,537 --> 00:07:15,774
PROBLEM IS, IT IS THE PILL

240
00:07:15,774 --> 00:07:16,775
PUSHERS AND PATRICK MORRISEY IS

241
00:07:16,775 --> 00:07:17,843
REPRESENTING THOSE PEOPLE FOR

242
00:07:17,843 --> 00:07:20,545
YEARS AND MADE MILLIONS.

243
00:07:20,545 --> 00:07:23,549
>> Bret: OUR FIRST BELL OF THE

244
00:07:23,549 --> 00:07:25,150
EVENING, BUT MR. MORRISEY.

245
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,852
>> THERE HE GOES YET AGAIN, DID

246
00:07:26,852 --> 00:07:28,987
YOUR MOM EVER TELL YOU THAT WE

247
00:07:28,987 --> 00:07:31,523
SHOULD WASH YOUR MOUTH OUT WITH

248
00:07:31,523 --> 00:07:33,358
SOAP WITH THOSE LIES?

249
00:07:33,358 --> 00:07:33,926
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

250
00:07:33,926 --> 00:07:34,993
I’LL TELL YOU WHAT, OBVIOUSLY

251
00:07:34,993 --> 00:07:36,595
NOT ONLY PEOPLE KNOW THAT WE DID

252
00:07:36,595 --> 00:07:37,596
NOT WORK ON THOSE ISSUES IN THE

253
00:07:37,596 --> 00:07:40,065
PRIVATE SECTOR, BUT NO ONE HAS

254
00:07:40,065 --> 00:07:44,136
DONE MORE TO GO AFTER THE OPIOID

255
00:07:44,136 --> 00:07:47,172
EPIDEMIC, SUING, GOING AFTER

256
00:07:47,172 --> 00:07:48,774
$78 MILLION IN DAMAGES FROM THE

257
00:07:48,774 --> 00:07:50,176
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES,

258
00:07:50,176 --> 00:07:53,145
RECENTLY WE WENT AFTER THE DEA,

259
00:07:53,145 --> 00:07:54,346
BECAUSE THAT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

260
00:07:54,346 --> 00:07:56,582
AGENCY HAD BEEN BLANKETING THE

261
00:07:56,582 --> 00:07:57,750
STATE, RUBBER-STAMPING THE

262
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,784
APPLICATIONS COMING IN, FLOODING

263
00:07:58,784 --> 00:08:00,786
WEST VIRGINIA WITH PILLS.

264
00:08:00,786 --> 00:08:02,188
WE WENT AFTER IT AND ARE PUTTING

265
00:08:02,188 --> 00:08:03,990
AN END TO THAT.

266
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,791
EDUCATION IN THE SCHOOLS, AND

267
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:06,959
OBVIOUSLY WE ARE GOING AFTER

268
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,094
TREATMENT AS WELL.

269
00:08:08,094 --> 00:08:10,096
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO ADDRESS

270
00:08:10,096 --> 00:08:11,264
PEOPLE’S NEEDS IN THEIR HEADS

271
00:08:11,264 --> 00:08:12,165
AND THEIR HEARTS.

272
00:08:12,165 --> 00:08:14,967
I WILL CONCLUDE ON THIS NOTE,

273
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:17,370
ALL OF US INCLUDING ME AND MY

274
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,172
FAMILY, WE HAVE SEEN ISSUES WITH

275
00:08:19,172 --> 00:08:19,539
ADDICTION.

276
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:21,574
THERE IS NO ONE HERE TONIGHT

277
00:08:21,574 --> 00:08:23,176
THAT HAS NOT FELT IT.

278
00:08:23,176 --> 00:08:25,211
AND FOR SOMEONE LIKE EVAN

279
00:08:25,211 --> 00:08:26,012
JENKINS TO KEEP THE POLITICAL

280
00:08:26,012 --> 00:08:28,581
DIALOGUE TO SAY THAT THINGS ARE

281
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:30,216
NOT TRUE TO HIDE HIS DEEP

282
00:08:30,216 --> 00:08:32,852
LIBERAL BACKGROUND IS VERY SAD.

283
00:08:32,852 --> 00:08:34,587
>> Bret: MR. MORRISEY I

284
00:08:34,587 --> 00:08:35,955
UNDERSTAND, BUT AS

285
00:08:35,955 --> 00:08:36,956
ATTORNEY GENERAL YOU DID SEE

286
00:08:36,956 --> 00:08:38,390
WITH THE MAJOR PILL DISTRIBUTOR,

287
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,659
BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOUR WIFE

288
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,162
WAS LOBBYING FOR THAT PILL

289
00:08:42,162 --> 00:08:43,530
DISTRIBUTOR PERIOD IS THAT NOT A

290
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:47,801
CONFLICT OF INTEREST?

291
00:08:47,801 --> 00:08:49,402
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

292
00:08:49,402 --> 00:08:50,737
>> WE HAVE HANDLED EVERYTHING

293
00:08:50,737 --> 00:08:52,773
EXACTLY RIGHT, I THINK MOST

294
00:08:52,773 --> 00:08:53,507
PEOPLE IN THE STATE WOULD SAY

295
00:08:53,507 --> 00:08:55,342
THAT WE HAVE A MORE EFFECTIVE

296
00:08:55,342 --> 00:08:58,378
TAKING ON THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC

297
00:08:58,378 --> 00:08:58,979
THAN ANYONE.

298
00:08:58,979 --> 00:09:01,148
I NOTE WHEN I GOT INTO OFFICE

299
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:02,449
THERE WAS NO SUBSTANCE ABUSE

300
00:09:02,449 --> 00:09:03,283
FIGHTING UNIT IN THE STATE.

301
00:09:03,283 --> 00:09:05,185
WE HAVE TURNED THINGS AROUND HER

302
00:09:05,185 --> 00:09:07,421
TO THE OTHER POINT, YOU CITED

303
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:11,191
IT, THE STATISTICS FROM

304
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:12,459
2007-2012, LOOK, JOE MANCHIN WAS

305
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:13,727
ON THE WATCH AS GOVERNOR.

306
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,963
HE WAS SLEEPING AT THE SWITCH

307
00:09:15,963 --> 00:09:17,331
WHEN PILLS WERE FLOODING INTO

308
00:09:17,331 --> 00:09:19,199
OUR STATE AND IT TOOK ME AND THE

309
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:21,802
AG OFFICE TO GO AFTER THAT

310
00:09:21,802 --> 00:09:24,371
AGGRESSIVELY.

311
00:09:24,371 --> 00:09:26,974
>> WHEN HE CAME INTO OFFICE,

312
00:09:26,974 --> 00:09:28,375
CARDINAL HEALTH PAID FOR HIS

313
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:28,776
PARTY.

314
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,678
THEY WERE SO HAPPY THAT PATRICK

315
00:09:30,678 --> 00:09:31,979
MORRISEY HAD WON THE ATTORNEY

316
00:09:31,979 --> 00:09:32,813
GENERAL, THEY KNEW THAT THEY HAD

317
00:09:32,813 --> 00:09:36,117
A FRIEND.

318
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,953
RETURNING THE MONEY.

319
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:42,990
>> HE HAS A PAIN PILL PLEDGE.

320
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:43,557
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

321
00:09:43,557 --> 00:09:46,928
HE HAS A PAIN PILL PLEDGE, HE

322
00:09:46,928 --> 00:09:48,095
HAS TAKEN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

323
00:09:48,095 --> 00:09:49,964
DOLLARS THAT HE WILL NOT RETURN.

324
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,600
SO THIS IS WHAT WE CALL

325
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:52,967
HYPOCRISY.

326
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,836
I WISH YOU WOULD STOP.

327
00:09:54,836 --> 00:09:56,771
>> Martha: LET’S GET TO

328
00:09:56,771 --> 00:09:58,239
MR. BLANKENSHIP IN HERE, YOU

329
00:09:58,239 --> 00:09:59,007
TALK TOUGH ON OPIOIDS.

330
00:09:59,007 --> 00:10:01,276
>> I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS WHAT

331
00:10:01,276 --> 00:10:02,176
THEY SAID.

332
00:10:02,176 --> 00:10:03,778
>> Martha: I WILL ASK YOU THE

333
00:10:03,778 --> 00:10:04,145
QUESTION.

334
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,247
IN FACT, YOU WANT TO DRUG TEST

335
00:10:06,247 --> 00:10:07,582
EVERYONE FROM LAWMAKERS TO

336
00:10:07,582 --> 00:10:08,983
TEACHERS, WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER

337
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,585
SIDE OF THE ISSUE?

338
00:10:10,585 --> 00:10:13,355
DO YOU HAVE EMPATHY FOR ADDICTS?

339
00:10:13,355 --> 00:10:15,423
>> I DO NOT THINK EMPATHY WILL

340
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,024
FIX THE PROBLEM.

341
00:10:16,024 --> 00:10:19,761
IF WE STOP THE DRUG ABUSE WE DO

342
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:21,129
NOT NEED TO HAVE EMPATHY.

343
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:22,797
WHEN WE SAY THAT PATRICK SAID HE

344
00:10:22,797 --> 00:10:23,932
IS THE ONLY CONSERVATIVE UP

345
00:10:23,932 --> 00:10:24,232
HERE.

346
00:10:24,232 --> 00:10:25,767
I ALREADY EXPLAINED THAT NEITHER

347
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:26,735
WOULD BE UP HERE WITHOUT ME. ME.

348
00:10:26,735 --> 00:10:30,939
BOTH OF THEM ARE MISLEADING.

349
00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:31,540
PATRICK MORRISEY CAME TO

350
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,009
WEST VIRGINIA IN 2012.

351
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,978
HE’S BEEN HERE SIX YEARS.

352
00:10:35,978 --> 00:10:38,080
DRUG ABUSE DEATHS HAVE GONE UP

353
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,814
63% AND THEY CONTINUE TO BE ON

354
00:10:38,814 --> 00:10:42,784
THE RISE.

355
00:10:42,784 --> 00:10:44,620
THEY LIKE TO TALK ABOUT

356
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,053
ENDORSEMENTS.

357
00:10:45,053 --> 00:10:47,389
MOST OF PATRICK MORRISEY’S

358
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:48,090
ENDORSEMENTS ARE THE SAME THAT

359
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,358
JOE MANCHIN HAD.

360
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:52,361
CONSERVATIVES DON’T GO OUT AND

361
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:53,796
TAKE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS FROM

362
00:10:53,796 --> 00:00:00,000
PLANNED PARENTHOOD, AND
