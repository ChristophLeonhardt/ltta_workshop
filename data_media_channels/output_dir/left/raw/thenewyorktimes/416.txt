00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:22,940
The company, at a 167 years old, 
started in Bari Italy in 1850.

2
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,630
We like to say we do everything 
from the White House to the firehouse,

3
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,360
as far as the range of scale
and size of our firework displays.

4
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,359
There are many precautions that
we have to put in place

5
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,010
and write very meticulously
as a procedure in handling

6
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,729
any type of pyrotechnic or
explosive.

7
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,220
We have unfortunately had one
pretty severe, catastrophic

8
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,510
explosion within our facilities
back in 1983.

9
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:03,120
And unfortunately that incident took
the life of my father and my cousin.

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,248
It's the inherent nature of this business
that we're dealing with explosives,

11
00:01:06,248 --> 00:01:08,340
we are dealing with a 
hazardous material.

12
00:01:10,380 --> 00:00:00,000
We have great employees and we
make people happy with what we do.
