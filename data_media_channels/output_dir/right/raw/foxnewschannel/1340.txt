1
00:00:00,116 --> 00:00:02,351
MARKETS THAT ARE DRIVING PEOPLE

2
00:00:02,351 --> 00:00:08,457
TO THIS COUNTRY EVERY DAY.

3
00:00:08,457 --> 00:00:09,425
>> Laura: LET’S GET THE

4
00:00:09,425 --> 00:00:11,561
PERSPECTIVE OF SENATOR MIKE LEE

5
00:00:11,561 --> 00:00:15,031
OF UTAH WHOSE NEW BOOK IS

6
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:15,832
ALREADY A HUGE "NEW YORK TIMES"

7
00:00:15,832 --> 00:00:16,432
BEST SELLER.

8
00:00:16,432 --> 00:00:18,234
IT’S ON MY FACEBOOK AND WEBSITE.

9
00:00:18,234 --> 00:00:19,635
WRITTEN OUT OF HISTORY, THE

10
00:00:19,635 --> 00:00:20,369
FORGOTTEN FOUNDERS WHO FOUGHT

11
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:22,839
FOR GOVERNMENT.

12
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:23,306
WELCOME SENATOR.

13
00:00:23,306 --> 00:00:24,641
AS ALWAYS IT’S GREAT TO SEE HER.

14
00:00:24,641 --> 00:00:25,908
I THINK OUR FOUNDERS WOULD BE

15
00:00:25,908 --> 00:00:27,043
SHOCKED TO SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED

16
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:27,844
TO THIS COUNTRY.

17
00:00:27,844 --> 00:00:30,446
OBVIOUSLY A WHOLE DIFFERENT

18
00:00:30,446 --> 00:00:31,114
SITUATION THAN OUR COUNTRY’S

19
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:31,614
FOUNDING.

20
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:32,415
YOU HEARD THE DEBATE WE JUST

21
00:00:32,415 --> 00:00:33,449
HAD.

22
00:00:33,449 --> 00:00:35,452
YOU HEARD THE STATISTICS.

23
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,419
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THESE

24
00:00:36,419 --> 00:00:37,520
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GO

25
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,358
HOME, THEN THEY ALL GET TO’S

26
00:00:41,358 --> 00:00:41,624
DAY.

27
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:42,392
THEY ARE RELOCATED TO CENTERS

28
00:00:42,392 --> 00:00:44,394
AND WE ARE TRYING TO CHECK ON

29
00:00:44,394 --> 00:00:44,761
THEM.

30
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:47,464
A LOT OF THEM ARE GOING OFF THE

31
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,498
GRID BECAUSE THEY DON’T WANT TO

32
00:00:48,498 --> 00:00:50,233
BE DEPORTED, THEY DON’T WANT THE

33
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:51,635
KIDS TO BE DEPORTED.

34
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:53,036
IT’S A PERVERSE SYSTEM WHICH SET

35
00:00:53,036 --> 00:00:54,070
UP.

36
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,105
>> THAT’S EXACTLY WHAT IS

37
00:00:55,105 --> 00:00:56,039
BRINGING THESE PEOPLE HERE.

38
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,440
THAT’S EXACTLY WHY THESE

39
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,208
CHILDREN ARE BEING SEPARATED

40
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,843
FROM THEIR PARENTS.

41
00:00:59,843 --> 00:01:01,044
WE HAD A GOVERNMENT THAT REFUSED

42
00:01:01,044 --> 00:01:02,045
TO ENFORCE THE LAW AND A

43
00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:02,879
GOVERNMENT THAT’S IT WE WILL

44
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,214
DEPORT YOU AND THEN DIDN’T.

45
00:01:04,214 --> 00:01:05,282
WHEN THAT HAPPENS YOU END UP

46
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:06,850
BEING A MAGNET FOR ILLEGAL

47
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:07,251
IMMIGRATION.

48
00:01:07,251 --> 00:01:08,185
THAT’S OBJECTS ALL KINDS OF

49
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:11,255
CHILDREN TO EXPLOITATION, ABUSE,

50
00:01:11,255 --> 00:01:12,256
ASSAULT IN MANY CASES.

51
00:01:12,256 --> 00:01:15,058
BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE, THAT IS THE

52
00:01:15,058 --> 00:01:15,359
CAUSE.

53
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,194
>> Laura: APPROXIMATELY 90% OF

54
00:01:17,194 --> 00:01:19,663
ALL REMOVAL ORDERS, THAT MEANS

55
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:20,764
DEPORTATION ORDERS EACH YEAR

56
00:01:20,764 --> 00:01:23,033
RESULT FROM A FAILURE FOR PEOPLE

57
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:26,837
TO SHOW UP AT THEIR HEARING.

58
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,172
THEY DON’T SHOW UP FOR THEIR

59
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:31,642
ACTUAL IMMIGRATION HEARING.

60
00:01:31,642 --> 00:01:32,376
THAT’S 90% OF THE UNACCOMPANIED

61
00:01:32,376 --> 00:01:33,978
MINORS ARE NOT SHOWING UP AT

62
00:01:33,978 --> 00:01:34,345
HEARINGS.

63
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:35,146
SO THEY COME HERE, THEY KNOW

64
00:01:35,146 --> 00:01:36,847
THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

65
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,048
STAY HERE.

66
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,816
WHAT IS THE SENATE ON THE HOUSE

67
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,451
COOKING UP?

68
00:01:40,451 --> 00:01:41,852
I HEAT, KEEP HEARING ABOUT THE

69
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:42,687
ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO COME

70
00:01:42,687 --> 00:01:44,922
OUT AND AGREE TO AN AMNESTY WITH

71
00:01:44,922 --> 00:01:48,359
AN END TO CHAIN MIGRATION.

72
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,128
IT’S NOT QUITE THE BOB GOODLATT

73
00:01:51,128 --> 00:01:52,263
GOODLATTE, WHAT’S GOING ON?

74
00:01:52,263 --> 00:01:54,031
>> I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT BE THE

75
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:54,765
BOB GOODLATTE BILL.

76
00:01:54,765 --> 00:01:57,235
I THINK HE’S DONE A REMARKABLE

77
00:01:57,235 --> 00:01:58,035
JOB OF BALANCING COMPETING

78
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:58,402
INTERESTS.

79
00:01:58,402 --> 00:01:59,637
I HOPE THEY ARE NOT COMING UP

80
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:00,872
WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT COOKED

81
00:02:00,872 --> 00:02:01,806
UP IN 2013.

82
00:02:01,806 --> 00:02:02,907
THEY TOLD US WE ARE COMING UP

83
00:02:02,907 --> 00:02:03,541
WITH A DEAL.

84
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,376
IT WAS RUMORED FOR MANY MONTHS,

85
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:06,678
YEARS IN FACT, THAT THEY WERE

86
00:02:06,678 --> 00:02:08,846
WORKING ON IT.

87
00:02:08,846 --> 00:02:10,215
AND IT WAS ABOUT A THOUSAND

88
00:02:10,215 --> 00:02:10,914
PAGES OF SOMETHING NOBODY HAD

89
00:02:10,914 --> 00:02:14,719
READ.

90
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,121
PEOPLE VOTED FOR IT ANYWAY AND

91
00:02:16,121 --> 00:02:17,222
THEN THEY SWITCHED IT AND

92
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:18,423
REPLACED IT WITH A DIFFERENT

93
00:02:18,423 --> 00:02:18,757
BILL.

94
00:02:18,757 --> 00:02:19,524
I FEAR THEY MIGHT BE DOING THE

95
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:21,626
SAME THING AND I THINK THEY

96
00:02:21,626 --> 00:02:22,260
REMEMBER THE CONSEQUENCE.

97
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:22,994
>> Laura: THE FREEDOM CAUCUS

98
00:02:22,994 --> 00:02:25,163
DOESN’T WANT IT.

99
00:02:25,163 --> 00:02:26,097
THEY ARE TO COME OUT AND SAID WE

100
00:02:26,097 --> 00:02:30,035
DON’T WANT AMNESTY, BUT CAN YOU

101
00:02:30,035 --> 00:02:31,436
GET SOMETHING POSITIVE?

102
00:02:31,436 --> 00:02:33,338
YOU COULD END HIS CHAIN

103
00:02:33,338 --> 00:02:34,239
MIGRATION.

104
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,475
THAT IS A HUGE AMPLIFIER OF

105
00:02:36,475 --> 00:02:38,710
IMMIGRATION IN THE COUNTRY,

106
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,711
NONMERIT-BASED.

107
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:44,383
THAT’S A BIG DRIVER.

108
00:02:44,383 --> 00:02:44,816
>> ABSOLUTELY.

109
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:45,851
THAT’S ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKE

110
00:02:45,851 --> 00:02:46,852
ABOUT THE GOODLATTE PROPOSAL.

111
00:02:46,852 --> 00:02:48,453
IT ADDRESSES THAT AN ADDRESSES

112
00:02:48,453 --> 00:02:50,055
THE DACA SITUATION.

113
00:02:50,055 --> 00:02:51,690
IT DOES SO IN A RESPONSIBLE

114
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,724
MANNER THAT SHUTS OFF THE

115
00:02:52,724 --> 00:02:53,058
MAGNET.

116
00:02:53,058 --> 00:02:54,026
>> Laura: I WANT TO ASK ABOUT

117
00:02:54,026 --> 00:02:57,729
THE OTHER NEWS OVER THE LAST FEW

118
00:02:57,729 --> 00:02:59,431
DAYS, YOUR COLLEAGUE MARCO RUBIO

119
00:02:59,431 --> 00:03:00,265
SAID SOMETHING I THINK

120
00:03:00,265 --> 00:03:01,633
INTERESTING ON ABC THIS WEEK.

121
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:03,769
I WOULD LIKE YOUR REACTION,

122
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:05,037
LET’S WATCH.

123
00:03:05,037 --> 00:03:06,038
>> IT APPEARS THAT THERE WAS AN

124
00:03:06,038 --> 00:03:08,440
INVESTIGATION OUT OF THE

125
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,441
CAMPAIGN BUT IF CERTAIN

126
00:03:09,441 --> 00:03:10,643
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE A HISTORY

127
00:03:10,643 --> 00:03:12,845
THAT WE SHOULD BE SUSPICIOUS OF

128
00:03:12,845 --> 00:03:16,549
THAT PREDATE THIS PRESIDENTIAL

129
00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:17,950
CAMPAIGN 2015-16.

130
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,820
THE FBI SHOULD LOOK AT PEOPLE

131
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,487
LIKE THAT BUT THEY ARE NOT

132
00:03:21,487 --> 00:03:25,891
INVESTIGATING THE CAMPAIGN.

133
00:03:25,891 --> 00:03:26,659
>> SO YOU ARE SAYING

134
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:28,027
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS WRONG?

135
00:03:28,027 --> 00:03:29,362
>> I HAVE SEEN NO EVIDENCE THAT

136
00:03:29,362 --> 00:03:30,229
THOSE PEOPLE WERE PART OF AN

137
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:32,031
INVESTIGATION ON THE CAMPAIGN.

138
00:03:32,031 --> 00:03:36,436
>> Laura: YOUR REACTION?

139
00:03:36,436 --> 00:03:37,403
>> HIS FINAL STATEMENT MIGHT BE

140
00:03:37,403 --> 00:03:37,703
TRUE.

141
00:03:37,703 --> 00:03:40,306
HE MAY HAVE SEEN NO EVIDENCE OF

142
00:03:40,306 --> 00:03:40,940
ANY SPYING ON THE TRUMP

143
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,307
CAMPAIGN.

144
00:03:41,307 --> 00:03:42,542
IT DOESN’T MEAN IT DIDN’T

145
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:42,875
HAPPEN.

146
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,044
I THINK IT’S VERY DIFFICULT TO

147
00:03:45,044 --> 00:03:46,079
PROVE THAT A DOG DIDN’T BARK.

148
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:49,649
I DON’T THINK HE SAYING HE

149
00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:50,016
DIDN’T --

150
00:03:50,016 --> 00:03:52,018
>> Laura: YOU’VE GOT RUBIO, WE

151
00:03:52,018 --> 00:03:53,086
WILL PLAY A SOUND BITE LATER ON

152
00:03:53,086 --> 00:03:55,054
FROM TREY GOWDY.

153
00:03:55,054 --> 00:03:56,956
THERE ARE A LOT OF REPUBLICANS

154
00:03:56,956 --> 00:03:58,725
WHO SEEM TO BE WORKING OVERTIME.

155
00:03:58,725 --> 00:04:01,327
A LOT OF THEM DIDN’T SUPPORT THE

156
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:02,028
PRESIDENT, WORKING OVERTIME TO

157
00:04:02,028 --> 00:04:04,631
BUILD A BOB MUELLER, THE MUELLER

158
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:04,931
TEAM.

159
00:04:04,931 --> 00:00:00,000
I THINK FROM THE VERY BEGINNING
