WHAT’S HIS NAME, BETO O’ROARKE,

25
00:01:00,308 --> 00:01:02,276
I KEEP READING A CULT FIGURE.

26
00:01:02,277 --> 00:01:03,911
IN SPITE OF AWFUL THINGS HE’S

27
00:01:03,912 --> 00:01:05,746
WRITTEN ABOUT WOMEN, A, AND

ACCIDENT, ACCORDING TO THE

00:01:11,954 --> 00:01:13,854
REPORT.

34
00:01:13,855 --> 00:01:16,090
HOW WOULD HE VOTE IN THE SENATE,

35
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:18,092
WOULD HE VOTE FOR SENATOR

36
00:01:18,093 --> 00:01:20,027
SCHUMER, WOULD HE HAVE VOTED

37
00:01:20,028 --> 00:01:21,229
AGAINST JUDGE KAVANAUGH?

38
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,965
>> BETO O’ROARKE IS A HARD KNOW

39
00:01:23,966 --> 00:01:25,033
ON BRETT KAVANAUGH.

40
00:01:25,034 --> 00:01:30,572
HE WAS A HARD NO BEFORE THE

HE’S RUNNING A FAR LEFT CAMPAIGN
ALLEGATIONS, HE’S A HARD NO NOW.

43
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:38,180
HE’S RUNNING A FAR LEFT CAMPAIGN

44
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,781
LIKE ELIZABETH WARREN, BERNIE

45
00:01:39,782 --> 00:01:40,615
SANDERS.

46
00:01:40,616 --> 00:01:42,650
TODAY WAS A GOOD DAY.

47
00:01:42,651 --> 00:01:44,119
TOMORROW, JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH

00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,020
IS GOING TO BECOME JUSTICE BRETT
TOMORROW, JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH

KAVANAUGH.

51
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:47,422
BUT WE WON BY THE SLIMMEST OF

52
00:01:47,423 --> 00:01:50,025
MARGINS.

53
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,693
IT’S WHY THIS ELECTION MATTERS,

54
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,428
WHY IT MATTERS THAT WE COP OUT

55
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:54,196
AND STAND UP.

56
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,530
THE SMEAR CAMPAIGN, WE HAVE

57
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:57,332
SEEN, PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST

58
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:00,368
TWO WEEKS HAS BEEN A NEW AND

59
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:01,103
DISGRACEFUL LOW FOR THE UNITED

60
00:02:01,104 --> 00:02:03,005
STATES SENATE.

61
00:02:03,006 --> 00:02:07,109
IT’S NOT ACCEPTABLE TO JUST GO

62
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,977
AFTER AND SLANDER JUDGE

63
00:02:08,978 --> 00:02:12,314
KAVANAUGH, SLANDER HIS FAMILY.

64
00:02:12,315 --> 00:02:13,482
FEET HIS KIDS TO THIS KIND OF

65
00:02:13,483 --> 00:02:14,983
HORRIFIC ABUSE.

66
00:02:14,984 --> 00:02:16,518
IT’S NOT RIGHT.

67
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:18,387
>> Sean: SENATOR, I LIVE IN

68
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,122
NEW YORK, ROUGH AND TUMBLE, OF

69
00:02:20,123 --> 00:02:21,990
NEW YORK.

70
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:22,891
PROBABLY A LITTLE MORE STREET

71
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,060
WISE THAN I SHOULD BE IN LIFE.

72
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,329
BUT I’D RATHER LIVE IN TEXAS,

73
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,097
BECAUSE YOU PAY NO STATE INCOME

74
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:29,665
TAXES.

75
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,467
AND NEW YORK STATE --.

76
00:02:31,468 --> 00:02:34,003
WE’D LOVE TO HAVE YOU, SEAN.

77
00:02:34,004 --> 00:02:36,772
>> Sean: I WANT TO ASK THIS.

78
00:02:36,773 --> 00:02:37,540
YOU’VE BEEN IN ROUGH AND TUMBLE

79
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,442
RACES.

80
00:02:39,443 --> 00:02:40,109
YOU AND THE PRESIDENT HAVE

81
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,243
DISAGREEMENTS.

82
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,412
YOU HAVE SUPPORTED THE AGENDA OF

83
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,880
THE BIGGEST TAX CUT, SECURING

84
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:45,314
OUR BORDERS.

85
00:02:45,315 --> 00:02:47,149
>> ABSOLUTELY.

86
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:47,750
>> Sean: CONSERVATIVE

87
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:48,417
ORIGINALIST ON THE SUPREME

88
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,285
COURT.

89
00:02:49,286 --> 00:02:51,954
YOU ARE KNOWN FOR YOUR NL OF THE

90
00:02:51,955 --> 00:02:53,556
CONSTITUTION, YOUR KNOWLEDGE.

91
00:02:53,557 --> 00:02:55,091
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE DANGERS,

92
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,894
IF THIS BEHAVIOR WERE TO BE

93
00:02:57,895 --> 00:02:58,261
REWARDED?

94
00:02:58,262 --> 00:02:59,929
>> WELL, WHAT WE’VE SEEN IN THE

95
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,565
LAST TWO YEARS IS THE EXTREME

96
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:04,133
LEFT, IS JUST FILLED WITH RAGE,

97
00:03:04,134 --> 00:03:05,535
THEY’RE FILLED WITH ANGER,

98
00:03:05,536 --> 00:03:06,703
THEY’RE FILLED WITH HATRED FOR

99
00:03:06,704 --> 00:03:08,171
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

100
00:03:08,172 --> 00:03:09,772
IT’S SPILLING OUT, IT’S SPILLING

101
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:12,242
OUT IN NASTY AND ANGRY PROTESTS
IT’S SPILLING OUT, IT’S SPILLING

102
00:03:12,243 --> 00:03:12,243
OUT IN NASTY AND ANGRY PROTESTS

103
00:03:12,243 --> 00:03:13,910
DURING THE KAVANAUGH HEARING.

104
00:03:13,911 --> 00:03:15,011
FIRST DAVE OF THE HEARING, 07

105
00:03:15,012 --> 00:03:18,114
PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED WITH THE

106
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,049
ACTIVE COMPLICITY OF DEMOCRATIC

107
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,383
SENATORS.

108
00:03:20,384 --> 00:03:22,552
JUST YESTERDAY, 300 PEOPLE WERE

109
00:03:22,553 --> 00:03:24,120
ARRESTED AT THE CAPITOL.

110
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,021
WE’RE SEEING AN ANGER,

111
00:03:25,022 --> 00:03:26,289
BITTERNESS.

112
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,992
YOU KNOW, THIS WEEK WE HAD SOME

113
00:03:28,993 --> 00:03:30,594
ONE SEND WHITE POWDER TO OUR

114
00:03:30,595 --> 00:03:32,495
CAMPAIGN OFFICE IN TEXAS THAT

115
00:03:32,496 --> 00:03:34,531
ENDED UP HAVING HAZ-MAT AND THE

116
00:03:34,532 --> 00:03:35,332
FBI CALLED IN BECAUSE THE

117
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,200
CONCERN WAS THAT IT WAS ANTHRAX.

118
00:03:37,201 --> 00:03:39,569
TURNED OUT TO BE NEGATIVE.

119
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,904
BUT WE’RE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT

120
00:03:40,905 --> 00:03:42,773
WHERE THERE’S AN ANGER, A RAGE,

121
00:03:42,774 --> 00:03:46,176
A FURY, AND IT’S WRONG.

122
00:03:46,177 --> 00:03:48,378
IT IS WRONG TO JUST SMEAR SOME

123
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:50,080
ONE’S CHARACTER LIKE THEY HAVE

124
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:52,015
DONE ON TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

125
00:03:52,016 --> 00:03:54,618
IT’S WRONG TO DO WHAT THE

126
00:03:54,619 --> 00:03:56,420
DEMOCRATS DID TO OUT DR. FORD.

127
00:03:56,421 --> 00:03:57,654
SHE ASKED THAT THE ALLEGATIONS

128
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:58,956
BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL.

129
00:03:58,957 --> 00:04:00,657
THE CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS

130
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:01,525
DIDN’T CARE, THEY OUTED HER

131
00:04:01,526 --> 00:04:02,259
AGAINST HER WILL.

132
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,594
THAT IS WRONG.

133
00:04:03,595 --> 00:04:04,995
WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO

134
00:04:04,996 --> 00:04:06,497
DISAGREE WITH EACH OTHER BUT

135
00:04:06,498 --> 00:04:09,033
STILL ENGAGE WITH CIVILITY,

136
00:04:09,034 --> 00:04:10,768
TREAT EACH OTHER WITH DECENCY.

137
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:12,403
>> Sean: YOU KNOW, YOU WERE IN A

138
00:04:12,404 --> 00:04:14,538
TOUGH PRIMARY WITH PRESIDENT

139
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:14,839
TRUMP.

140
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,840
IT’S NOT BEANBAGS.

141
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:17,074
>> SURE.

142
00:04:17,075 --> 00:04:19,176
>> Sean: YOU GAVE, TOOK.

143
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:21,378
NUDZ A DEBATE AT THE END OF THE

144
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:25,583
DAY, YOU WERE ASKED, WELL, WHY

145
00:04:25,584 --> 00:04:26,851
DID YOU MAKE THE DECISION TO GO

146
00:04:26,852 --> 00:04:28,419
ALONG WITH THE PRESIDENT.

147
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,687
YOU SAID I’M HERE TO REPRESENT

148
00:04:29,688 --> 00:04:31,155
THE PEOPLE OF TEXAS.

149
00:04:31,156 --> 00:04:33,057
SEEMS LIKE THAT CAMPAIGN, I KNOW

150
00:04:33,058 --> 00:04:34,625
THE PRESIDENT IS A DISRUPTOR, HE
SEEMS LIKE THAT CAMPAIGN, I KNOW

151
00:04:34,626 --> 00:04:34,626
THE PRESIDENT IS A DISRUPTOR, HE

152
00:04:34,626 --> 00:04:36,294
BREAKS A LOT OF DISHES, BUT WE

153
00:04:36,295 --> 00:04:38,229
SEE THE RESULTS, DON’T WE.

154
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,931
AND YOU PUT THE PEOPLE OF YOUR

155
00:04:39,932 --> 00:04:43,801
STATE AHEAD.

156
00:04:43,802 --> 00:04:46,571
NOTHING EVER HAS BEEN THIS BAD.

157
00:04:46,572 --> 00:04:47,238
I’VE NEVER SEEN THINGS THIS

158
00:04:47,239 --> 00:04:48,039
AWFUL.

159
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,276
>> THE ANGER, THE FURY, THE

160
00:04:51,277 --> 00:04:52,410
FRANKLY THREATS OF VIOLENCE ARE

161
00:04:52,411 --> 00:04:54,646
REALLY DISTURBING.

162
00:04:54,647 --> 00:04:55,580
>> Sean: DUE PROCESS.

163
00:04:55,581 --> 00:04:57,115
>> SENATORS, PEOPLE SHOWING UP

164
00:04:57,116 --> 00:04:58,416
AT THEIR HOUSE, THREATENING

165
00:04:58,417 --> 00:04:59,150
THEIR FAMILY.

166
00:04:59,151 --> 00:05:01,786
IT’S NOT GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY.

167
00:05:01,787 --> 00:05:03,555
AND YOU LOOK AT THIS HEARING,

168
00:05:03,556 --> 00:05:05,223
THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF DUE

169
00:05:05,224 --> 00:05:06,991
PRINCIPLES OF THE PRESUMPTION OF

170
00:05:06,992 --> 00:05:09,227
PROCESS, AS YOU SAID, THE BASIC

171
00:05:09,228 --> 00:05:09,995
PRINCIPLES OF THE PRESUMPTION OFINNOCENCE, YOU’RE INNOCENT UNTIL

172
00:05:09,996 --> 00:05:09,996
INNOCENCE, YOU’RE INNOCENT UNTIL

173
00:05:09,996 --> 00:05:11,763
PROVEN GUILTY.

174
00:05:11,764 --> 00:05:13,899
YOU KNOW, LISTEN, ONCE THESE

175
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,633
ALLEGATIONS WERE MADE THEY WERE

176
00:05:14,634 --> 00:05:15,333
SERIOUS.

177
00:05:15,334 --> 00:05:15,967
NEEDED TO BE TREATED WITH

178
00:05:15,968 --> 00:05:17,202
RESPECT.

179
00:05:17,203 --> 00:05:18,436
WE NEEDED A FULL AND FAIR

180
00:05:18,437 --> 00:05:20,639
HEARING, AND WE DID.

181
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,340
WE NEEDED TO GIVE DR. FORD AN

182
00:05:22,341 --> 00:05:23,075
OPPORTUNITY TO TREAT HER WITH

183
00:05:23,076 --> 00:05:25,844
RESPECT AND WE DID.

184
00:05:25,845 --> 00:05:27,479
BUT WE NEED TO GIVE JUDGE

185
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,146
KAVANAUGH AN OPPORTUNITY TO

186
00:05:28,147 --> 00:05:28,814

GOODNESS GRACIOUS.

197
00:05:45,598 --> 00:05:48,300
THINGS IN THEIR YEAR -- STUPID

ITS WAS A RIDICULOUS CIRCUS.

201
00:05:54,407 --> 00:05:55,774
THEY WERE WILLING TO SMEAR A

202
00:05:55,775 --> 00:05:57,109
GOOD MAN AND HIS FAMILY FOR

203
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,944

00:06:27,808 --> 00:06:28,341

WE SHOWED UP AT A RESTAURANT

231

232
00:06:40,588 --> 00:06:41,821
UNFORTUNATELY SOMEHOW THE

233
00:06:41,822 --> 00:06:42,722
PROTESTERS WERE THERE WAITING

234
00:06:42,723 --> 00:06:44,824

IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE DINNER.

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,333
SO HEIDI AND I GOT UP TO LEAVE,

241
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:54,034
THEY BLOCKED HER FROM GETTING

242
00:06:54,035 --> 00:06:55,135
OUT.

243
00:06:55,136 --> 00:06:56,603
WHEN WE LEFT THE RESTAURANT,

244
00:06:56,604 --> 00:06:57,938
THIS ACTUALLY HAS NOT BEEN

245
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:59,239

246
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,340
RESTAURANT, WENT OUT THE DOOR

247
00:07:00,341 --> 00:07:01,875
AND AROUND THE BACK ALLEY.

00:07:09,784 --> 00:07:11,518
A WAITER FROM THE RESTAURANT LET

00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,185

254
00:07:12,186 --> 00:07:13,453
KITCHEN.

255
00:07:13,454 --> 00:07:15,956
AND WE TOOK SHELTER IN THE

00:07:15,957 --> 00:07:16,723

POLICE ARRIVED AND THEY REMOVED

261
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,564

262
00:07:23,565 --> 00:07:25,165
AND I ASKED HEIDI, WELL WHAT DO

263
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,867

264
00:07:26,868 --> 00:07:27,167
ELSE?

265
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:28,302
SHE SAID NO.

266
00:07:28,303 --> 00:07:29,470
I LIKE THIS RESTAURANT, LET’S
