cheeseburger lettuce tomato shack sauce on a toasted potato bun and what I like to do is right before I cook the patty I'll toast my bun brush with a little bit of butter and toasted the inside so it gets a little bit of crunch on it which great tip because what you'll want to do is create contrast so we use very soft potato buns we want to get the inside just a little bit crunchy so you have that nice contrast with a soft pillowy exterior crunchy interior little details like that can really up your burger game put all the elements together on the bun so when that burger comes off and goes on the bun you can eat it right away you don't want to wait it's when the burger comes off it's gonna be nice and juicing the cheese's to be a melty and drippy last thing we need to do is cook the burger which we're gonna do right now next we're gonna do is gonna smash our patty into the griddle praying a nice beautiful even sear that's gonna create a lot of flavor for us add salt and pepper and what we do is we take the entire steak itself and grind out to make a burger we're looking for good fat content for us that's somewhere around 20 80 20 percent fat that 80% lean if you really want something amazing go a little higher go about 22% fat I'm gonna take my spatula now I'm gonna raise it high and try to get all that crust off because that's where the flavor is and then give it a nice play see that golden brown crust that is where all the flavor is that's also locking all the juices last thing a slice of American cheese see it's all draping down nice seats getting soft that's about the time you want to pull the burger off you don't want to go further than that put it right down the center of the bump and as I was saying before because the sauce less and tomato on there I'm just gonna shut it that's the Shack burger
