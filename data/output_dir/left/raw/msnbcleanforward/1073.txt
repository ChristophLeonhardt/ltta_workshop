TO ADVANTAGE HIM IN ELECTIONS, RIGHT?

78
00:02:46,402 --> 00:02:48,536
RIGHT? AND CERTAINLY NOT TO DO

79
00:02:48,537 --> 00:02:50,805
AND CERTAINLY NOT TO DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD

80
00:02:50,806 --> 00:02:52,941
SOMETHING THAT WOULD DISADVANTAGE HIS FAVORED

81
00:02:52,975 --> 00:02:55,410
DISADVANTAGE HIS FAVORED CANDIDATES IN AN ELECTION.

82
00:02:55,444 --> 00:02:57,745
CANDIDATES IN AN ELECTION. AND, YOU KNOW, YOU’D THINK THAT

83
00:02:57,747 --> 00:02:59,848
AND, YOU KNOW, YOU’D THINK THAT IF HE -- EVEN IF HE BELIEVED

84
00:02:59,882 --> 00:03:01,516
IF HE -- EVEN IF HE BELIEVED THESE THINGS HE’D HAVE THE

85
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,750
THESE THINGS HE’D HAVE THE DECENCY TO BE A LITTLE BIT

86
00:03:02,752 --> 00:03:05,553
DECENCY TO BE A LITTLE BIT ASHAMED OF IT, BUT HE’S NOT.

87
00:03:05,555 --> 00:03:08,657

00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:09,758
LOUD. ONE PROBLEM WITH DOING THAT IS

90
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,862
ONE PROBLEM WITH DOING THAT IS THAT IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE A

91
00:03:13,896 --> 00:03:17,866
THAT IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE A SPECIAL COUNSEL LOOKING FOR

92
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:20,402
SPECIAL COUNSEL LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE OF CORRUPT INTENT, IT’S

93

EVIDENCE OF CORRUPT INTENT, IT’S HARD TO GET BETTER THAN THE

94
00:03:23,673 --> 00:03:24,673
HARD TO GET BETTER THAN THE PRESIDENT SAYING THAT THE

ATTORNEY GENERAL REALLY SHOULD PONY UP ON THAT SCORE.

100
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:35,984
PONY UP ON THAT SCORE. >> YEAH.

THEY WERE AS AMERICAN AS THEY COULD BE.

188
