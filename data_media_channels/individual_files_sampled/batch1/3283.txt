so just to start what do you think about pressure on value on equity valuations at the levels that they are on right now yeah the way I look at the world you know the market cycle has different phases and where we happen for the last few years has really been the Goldilocks sort of mid cycle phase you know decent growth double-digit earnings growth but no inflation low interest rates a Fed that's sort of not getting in the way of things and I think now we're transitioning towards what we call late cycle we're not there yet but we're clearly moving in that direction so the Fed is now in play it's raising rates and typically that's a the part of the market cycle where valuations start to come down and I think that's especially relevant today because valuations have been so high you know as of January at the recent high that the the trailing p/e was at 21 times earnings which really gets up there and I saw I think for the next year or so as we approach and enter late cycle that's really going to be the big part of the conversation and how much do have to continue to grow or grow in order to offset compression that we're seeing in valuation yeah so that's really the the critical element because when you look at the markets history if pease need to come down more often than not that means the market comes down as well but about a quarter of the time you can have a p/e reset if you will while the market generally stays up and you know I know the markets down ten percent but statistically speaking that's not a big deal historically so the key component to that is how strong earnings growth is because when you look at valuation it's really the earnings though in the numerator of the discounted cash flow model and the interest rate or the liquidity environment goes in the denominator and the stronger that earnings growth is in the numerator the more the p/e can reset lower without knocking the market down and that's basically what we're seeing you know the forward p/e using next 12 months expected earnings has already declined from nineteen point four in January to sixteen point one at the recent low a few days ago that that's a that's a really constructive thing to happen while the market really is down you know eight or ten percent so not at the same scale exactly and what are you looking at during this Ernie cycle to see if we will continue to be in that period where like you say we're threading the needle in that sweet spot yeah so it's interesting because generally the earnings estimates if you look at the aggregated consensus numbers they tend to start high and drift lower I mean that's sort of been a hallmark of earnings season but this time around this will be the first quarter since the corporate tax cut and the estimate is for 17 percent year-over-year growth and that estimate has been rock-solid now for probably at least four or five weeks so it's really interesting how it has not drifted down and the same thing is true for q2 which is pegged at 19 percent right now so what I'm looking at for earnings season which of course is starting now is a to see whether the companies will deliver that 17% and my my guess is that they are because generally if they're not going to they will guide lower you know nobody likes surprises but more importantly will they guide towards the next quarter lower the same or higher and again you know the the the tax cuts were really a monumental event a one-time event that you know a lot of companies weren't even really expecting and this will be the first quarter post that tax cut so it will be an important barometer to see where companies think they're going not so much in q1 but moving forward and if earnings growth stays up you know in the 17 19 20 % you can have what I would call a benign valuation reset but if the numbers turn out to be either too high or they're where they need to be but they will come down then that maybe is a different story because then you lose that that tailwind and when you look at the tech sector is the same hold true as far as valuation pressures for the tech sector I think it's really about the earnings growth because on a forward p/e basis the tech sector only trades at 18 times earnings and the market trades at you know 16 17 times so it's really not that expensive you know price to sales is I think at four times back in 2000 at the dot-com I think it was seven times so you know so I don't think it's necessarily a valuation problem but obviously it's been a big momentum they have the earnings growth and I think as long as that earnings growth continues I think that sector will be okay the whole kind of growth structural growth area will be okay but I think it comes down to the earnings you know when you have very high earnings growth you can support higher valuations but even then we don't really have such high valuations in tech and one of the other valuation pressures that you talked about our the fears of a trade war or anti trade policies can you talk about that yeah so if globalization which of course we've had since the early 90s but especially into 2000's if if the byproduct of product of globalization is stronger global growth and lower inflation then protectionism I think is a form of D globalization should bring the opposite so it'll bring less growth still positive growth but just less more moderate growth and probably somewhat higher inflation and again inflation and PE ratios are very closely inversely correlated over time and so if inflation goes up the PE should come down so it's another hallmark of late cycle you got the Fed you've got terrorist potentially protectionist trade policy and both of those don't necessarily have to knock the market down but they are PE negatives there they're headwinds for PE s and then it comes back to threading that needle of earnings offsetting the the the overall pressure on fees and the Fed tightening being P negative how worried are you about that and how could it get to a place that becomes more dangerous for the market yeah so last August which was a key inflection point for the market because at that point nobody was expecting tax cuts anymore and the 10-year Treasury had fallen to 2% and the bond market which of course is always pricing in the potential future was pricing in only one more rate hike over the subsequent two years which was kind of silly because the Fed through its dots was signaling six rate hikes in two years so the market and the Fed were completely on different pages now they're much closer you know as the market reset because the tax cuts happened the bond market and the Fed started to think about okay we're getting fiscal stimulus nine years into an expansion at full employment that has to be inflationary so now the market is pricing in about four more hikes in two years the Fed is at five so they're still not on the same page but they're very they're a lot closer and so whether the 10-year Treasury belongs at you know two point seven or three point one you know it's it's close enough at this point so for me to get worried about the Fed is if the Fed ends up being much more hawkish than what the market is expecting driving that sort of risk-free rate higher than that that would be another headwind but at this point you know there are no there's really no indications for that and and one way that I try to look at it which is a little geeky but when you look at the real Fed Funds rate and you compare to what's called the natural rate of interest our star as it's called the the real funds rate is around zero and the natural rate is around zero and historically the Fed has gotten the economy into trouble when the Fed was about two to three percentage points above our star and we're right on top of each other right now so for me even if the Fed were to tighten every quarter for the next two years it would we still kind of don't get to that point where you really get worried about an inverted yield curve and the Fed kind of taking the punchbowl away too much so I think for now we're okay here and how should investors be positioning themselves in this kind of were okay and valuations could compress but are you expecting any big downturns or are you just a little cautious with more volatility you know the last two years until the January hi were really extraordinary times for the market and I think I'm and I fear that investors got spoiled by that because the S&P was up I think fifty-two percent in two years and in 2017 the the volatility the standard deviation of those returns was at an all-time low of three point nine and that created a Sharpe ratio return divided by ball of five and a half which is at the 99th percentile of all time you know of the entire history so it literally doesn't get any better than that and it's not the way the market is normally supposed to be you're supposed to get 10% a year against the 15 wall not 25 a year against the four of all you know so I think as we transition from mid to late volatility of course it already has returned but it will become a more volatile market not unusually so but consistent with with history and returns will be less still positive but but but but less so it's kind of a lower your expectations mindset but it's still a market that I want to be involved with because but it's just it's not a time to bet big you know late cycle is a notoriously difficult part of the cycle to pin down whereas mid cycle is is really the sweet spot and so you kind of rein in your bets you lower your expectations but it's by no means in my opinion a reason to get out you
