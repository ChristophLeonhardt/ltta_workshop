GREAT TO SEE YOU.

00:00:04,116 --> 00:00:05,351
SOURCES TELLING FOX NEWS THAT

00:00:05,351 --> 00:00:06,686
THE NEW FBI REPORT COULD BE

00:00:06,686 --> 00:00:09,622
FINISHED AS SOON AS TOMORROW.

6
00:00:09,622 --> 00:00:11,957
>> A LOT IS GOING TO DEPEND ON

7
00:00:11,957 --> 00:00:14,627
WHAT COMES BACK FROM THE FBI IN

8
00:00:14,627 --> 00:00:16,295
TERMS OF THEIR ADDITIONAL

9
00:00:16,295 --> 00:00:18,864
NUMBERS HAVE INVESTIGATION.

10
00:00:18,864 --> 00:00:20,466
I THINK THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS

11
00:00:20,466 --> 00:00:21,500
DOING VERY WELL RIGHT NOW.

12
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,868
>> Martha: JOINING ME NOW AN

13
00:00:22,868 --> 00:00:23,602
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW IS SOMEONE

14
00:00:23,602 --> 00:00:26,439

BEDDINGS ARE JUDGE KAVANAUGH,

16
00:00:27,673 --> 00:00:28,074
PERSONALLY.

17
00:00:28,074 --> 00:00:29,275
KRISTI REMINGTON HAS KNOWN JUDGE

18
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:31,877
KAVANAUGH FOR OVER 20 YEARS, WAS

19
00:00:31,877 --> 00:00:32,677
INVOLVED IN HIS FIFTH BACKGROUND

20
00:00:32,677 --> 00:00:34,280
INVESTIGATION WHEN HE WAS

21
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,448
APPOINTED TO THE D.C. CIRCUIT

22
00:00:35,448 --> 00:00:36,415
COURT.

23
00:00:36,415 --> 00:00:37,116
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING

24
00:00:37,116 --> 00:00:37,783
HERE TONIGHT.

25
00:00:37,783 --> 00:00:40,052
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS

26
00:00:40,052 --> 00:00:42,054
TIME FRAME IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY

27
00:00:42,054 --> 00:00:42,655
HAD TO DO?

28
00:00:42,655 --> 00:00:44,323
WE KNOW THEY SPOKE TO DEBORAH

29
00:00:44,323 --> 00:00:45,424
RAMIREZ AT LENGTH AND MARK JUDGE

30
00:00:45,424 --> 00:00:46,892
AT LIKE THREE AS IT MAKES IS

31
00:00:46,892 --> 00:00:48,661
THAT IT COULD POSSIBLY WRAP UP

32
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:50,563
AS SOON AS TOMORROW?

33
00:00:50,563 --> 00:00:52,832
>> CERTAINLY, AS MANY PEOPLE

34
00:00:52,832 --> 00:00:54,500
HAVE SAID, HE'S BEEN THROUGH SIX

35
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,536
FULL-FIELD BACKGROUND

36
00:00:56,536 --> 00:00:57,670
INVESTIGATIONS.

37
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,271
SO THOSE INVESTIGATIONS

38
00:00:58,271 --> 00:01:01,040
GENERALLY BUILD ON THE PREVIOUS

39
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,076
ONES, AND AS A SENATE HAS ASKED,

40
00:01:03,076 --> 00:01:05,645
IT WAS THIS ONE WOULD BE VERY

41
00:01:05,645 --> 00:01:06,746
LIMITED SCOPE.

42
00:01:06,746 --> 00:01:07,447
I WOULD UNDERSTAND WHY IT

43
00:01:07,447 --> 00:01:09,916
WOULDN'T TAKE VERY LONG, AND THE

44
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:10,683
FBI HAS MANY INVESTIGATORS THEY

45
00:01:10,683 --> 00:01:13,052
GET SENT OUT.

46
00:01:13,052 --> 00:01:14,053
>> Martha: A QUOTE FROM

47
00:01:14,053 --> 00:01:15,655
DR. FORD'S LEGAL TEAM TO THE FBI

48
00:01:15,655 --> 00:01:16,689
TODAY BECAUSE THEY ARE UPSET

49
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:19,225
THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN

50
00:01:19,225 --> 00:01:20,660
CONTACTED IN THE COURSE OF THIS

51
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,627
SUPPLEMENTAL INVESTIGATION.

52
00:01:21,627 --> 00:01:23,062
THEY SAY IT'S INCONCEIVABLE THAT

53
00:01:23,062 --> 00:01:25,665
THE FBI COULD CONDUCT A THOROUGH

54
00:01:25,665 --> 00:01:27,266
INVESTIGATION OF DR. FORD'S

55
00:01:27,266 --> 00:01:28,234
ALLEGATIONS WITHOUT INTERVIEWING

56
00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:29,635
HER, JUDGE KAVANAUGH, OR THE

57
00:01:29,635 --> 00:01:31,537
WITNESSES THAT WE HAVE

58
00:01:31,537 --> 00:01:33,673
IDENTIFIES

59
00:01:33,673 --> 00:01:36,242
IDENTIFIED IN OUR LETTERS TO

60
00:01:36,242 --> 00:01:36,576
YOU."

61
00:01:36,576 --> 00:01:37,243
>> BOTH JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND

62
00:01:37,243 --> 00:01:40,747
JUDGE KAVANAUGH TESTIFIED UNDER

63
00:01:40,747 --> 00:01:41,214
OATH.

64
00:01:41,214 --> 00:01:42,215
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THE FBI

65
00:01:42,215 --> 00:01:43,650
WOULDN'T FEEL THE NEED TO GO

66
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,517
BACK OUT TO THEM, THEY HAD

67
00:01:44,517 --> 00:01:48,054
ACCESS TO THAT TESTIMONY

68
00:01:48,054 --> 00:01:48,454
PRESUMABLY.

69
00:01:48,454 --> 00:01:49,222
>> Martha: A LOT OF WHAT WE

70
00:01:49,222 --> 00:01:50,423
ARE SEEING IN THE INTERIM IN

71
00:01:50,423 --> 00:01:52,759
TERMS OF NEW INFORMATION THAT IS

72
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,928
KIND OF FLOODING THE MARKET HERE

73
00:01:54,928 --> 00:02:00,400
INCLUDES A LOT OF REALLY WILD

74
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,134
CHARGES FROM A NUMBER OF PEOPLE

75
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:01,868
THAT HE WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL OR

76
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:04,137
COLLEGE WITH, WE ARE ALSO

77
00:02:04,137 --> 00:02:05,438
GETTING HANDWRITTEN INFORMATION

78
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:07,240
ABOUT BEACH WEEK, BACK TO BEACH

79
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,441
WEEK IN 1983.

80
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:09,408
I JUST WANT TO PUT THIS UP ON

81
00:02:09,408 --> 00:02:12,846
THE SCREEN.

82
00:02:12,846 --> 00:02:15,048
THIS IS A NOTE THAT PURPORTEDLY

83
00:02:15,048 --> 00:02:16,316
HE WROTE, BRETT KAVANAUGH ROAD,

84
00:02:16,316 --> 00:02:18,017
IT IS SIGNED BY "BARRED," I

85
00:02:18,017 --> 00:02:19,853
DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS A

86
00:02:19,853 --> 00:02:21,755
NICKNAME, IT SAYS IT WAS --

87
00:02:21,755 --> 00:02:22,422
INFORMING ALL OF HIS FRIENDS

88
00:02:22,422 --> 00:02:25,125
ABOUT THE PLAN FOR BEACH WEEKEND

89
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:25,859
HE IS IS OUTLINING WHAT EVERYONE

90
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:27,861
NEEDS TO BRING, AND HE SAID

91
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:28,194
WE NEED

92
00:02:28,194 --> 00:02:28,828
TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE WE

93
00:02:28,828 --> 00:02:30,497
DON'T WANT TO GET KICKED OUT.

94
00:02:30,497 --> 00:02:31,631
PS, IT WILL PROBABLY BE A GOOD

95
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:33,300
IDEA ON SATURDAY THE 18TH TO

96
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,435
WARN THE NEIGHBORS THAT WE ARE

97
00:02:35,435 --> 00:02:37,437
LOUD, OBNOXIOUS DRUNKS WITH

98
00:02:37,437 --> 00:02:40,874
PROLIFIC PUKERS AMONG US."

99
00:02:40,874 --> 00:02:44,244
IS THIS RELEVANT IN ANY WAY TO?

100
00:02:44,244 --> 00:02:46,913
>> NORMALLY WE DRAW A LINE THESE

101
00:02:46,913 --> 00:02:50,884
FBI INVESTIGATIONS AT THEIR 18TH

102
00:02:50,884 --> 00:02:53,120
BIRTHDAY.

103
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,122
I THINK AT LEAST IN JUDICIAL

104
00:02:55,122 --> 00:03:01,228
SELECTION, WHAT IS MOST RELEVAN

105
00:03:01,228 --> 00:03:01,929
RELEVANT, AT LEAST IN THE BUSH

106
00:03:01,929 --> 00:03:02,663
ADMINISTRATION, AND THE PEOPLE

107
00:03:02,663 --> 00:03:03,263
WHO WERE REVIEWING THE

108
00:03:03,263 --> 00:03:06,233
BACKGROUNDS OF CANDIDATES, WHAT

109
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:06,900
THEY DID AS AN ADULT AND HOW

110
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,636
THEY ACTED AS AN ADULT, WHAT

111
00:03:09,636 --> 00:03:10,871
THEY HAVE GROWN AS A LAWYER, AND

112
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:12,272
IN THIS CASE, WHAT THEY HAVE

113
00:03:12,272 --> 00:03:13,073
DONE AS    AS A JUDGE.

114
00:03:13,073 --> 00:03:14,308
>> Martha: THERE IS A LOT OF

115
00:03:14,308 --> 00:03:15,809
FOCUS OF PROVING HE IS A SLOPPY

116
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:17,077
DRUNK IS WHAT WE HAVE HEARD OF

117
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:18,212
THE LAST 24 HOURS.

118
00:03:18,212 --> 00:03:20,080
IS THAT PART OF THE ORIGINAL

119
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,847
BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT WERE DONE

120
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:23,650
ON HIM, LOOKING INTO ALCOHOL

121
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,017
BEHAVIOR?

122
00:03:24,017 --> 00:03:26,853
>> CERTAINLY, THAT IS A STANDARD

123
00:03:26,853 --> 00:03:28,055
QUESTION AND EVERY BACKGROUND

124
00:03:28,055 --> 00:00:00,000
INVESTIGATION.
