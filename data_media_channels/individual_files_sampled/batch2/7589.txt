through several election cycles Republicans in Congress have argued that they need to make it difficult for individuals to vote in elections through voter ID laws and other forms of making it harsher difficult to vote because they're concerned about voter fraud they want to make sure that they maintain the integrity of our elections even though there was no evidence that there was voter fraud or any widespread voter fraud they succeeded in passing legislation that made it increasingly difficult for people to vote legally now with that said the House GOP has just refused to boost funding for election security so this is additional funding for state election security and it's a grant that is usually included in the spending bill and so Republicans are saying no we don't want to we don't want to add additional funding to that it's not an issue it's not a problem so to give you more information Republicans argue that the program which is overseen by the federal election assistance Commission is fully funded and does not need additional allocations but guess what representative Jim Jordan says I know what we need for safe and secure elections and that's voter ID hmm so look the reason why I'm bringing up voter ID laws is because there is a concern right now that our elections moving forward can be tampered with can be manipulated we have reason to believe that the Russian meddling that occurred during the 2016 election will occur again and maybe it'll be more widespread and more effective this time around so in the House Democrats are urging Republicans to agree with them to offer more funding so on a state level state lawmakers can use that funding to ensure that they have secure elections and Republicans like no it's funded it's fine but that is not the case and I'll give you the evidence in just a second so let's go to graphic 23 the Senate version of the financial services spending bill also excluded new money for election security grants it passed the Senate Appropriations Committee on a bipartisan vote and also here is the reality of how the elections get funded for security purposes the federal election assistance Commission that administers the election security grant program two states currently only has two of four commissioners so it's understaffed not enough to form a quorum and approve new voluntary voting system guidelines against which the voting system can be tested to determine if they meet required standards so there's an issue right there another issue is this the bulk of the three point six billion dollars authorized under the help America Vote Act which was passed in the wake of the contested 2000 presidential election was sent to States well over a decade ago to upgrade voting systems in many cases those systems now need new upgrades so they are referring to money that was given to the states a decade ago and they're saying no no it's funded it's fine it's fine but those voter ID laws let's do something about that that's actually almost two decades ago and they say well there's still a little bit of money left in that appropriation and that is true to be fair but we've got new challenges and look I commissioned doesn't even have quorum that means they're not doing anything any American who actually cares about our democracy should be deeply concerned that foreign agents are trying to hack in and by the way dan coach the Director of National Intelligence under Trump says it's not just the Russian as a soul so the Chinese so also the North Koreans and the Iranians so those are the top four countries trying to break in through cyberattacks into America he explains the Chinese are more interested in trade and business secrets that they're trying to steal the Russians are the most aggressive foreign actor in terms of trying to mess with our elections but whether it's Iran Russia or China or any of these people and and if you care about our country and our national security and making sure that we don't have voter fraud this would be your number one priority your hair would be on fire going my god the Commission doesn't even meet because they don't have quorum that's crazy instead the Republicans are saying dad I don't worry about it there's some leftover money we'll be fine now why are they saying that one trouble and I don't care what you say I don't care I don't care Trump won Trump won it wasn't the Russians okay that's point one point two is I think they secretly think looks like the Rice's are on our side meeting the Republican side well I mean I know that the Republicans aren't necessarily looking forward to the midterm elections and so there is concern that hey midterm elections are coming up we want to make sure that our election systems are safe we want to make sure that we have enough funding put in place so people can secure elections and I don't know it doesn't seem as though Republicans really care so much about securing the election process as much as they care about excluding certain citizens from voting and but but including foreign actors and foreign agents so it's look the one thing that is absolutely clear is Republicans never cared about voter fraud all they cared about was Republicans winning so and by the way most of the voter fraud that's uncovered is done by Republicans we've shown it on the show over and over again right and now you have foreign actors that are hacking in they're like wait who are they voting for oh right they're voting for Republicans Oh representative Dan new House Republican of Washington says there's no crisis so if you think for some reason no big deal who cares of the Russians that other governments are trying to get into the vote who cares who cares you're weird but okay that's fine you that's your opinion but what you're not allowed to say is I care about voter fraud you're not allowed to say that because you don't and if you're a Republican shut up about voter fraud because you just proved you don't care about it at all two easy ways following
