tonight a special conversation with author and historian Conrad Black about his new book Donald Trump a president like no other it's May 21st and you're watching the Ezra lavance show there's 8,500 customers here and you won't give them an answer here once a year with the sign welcome back will a very exciting day today on Victoria Day the entire show will be dedicated to a new book on Donald Trump published by Conrad Black the book is called Donald Trump a president not like no other and joining us now in studio is Lord black himself welcome to the show great to have you in studio thank you thanks for having me over I'm a fan of yours I have me in a long time but I want to tell you let me confess to you when I heard you had this new book out I was nervous because you have written some very thick books of history before and I thought this is gonna be a slog I was ready for a phone book this was a 256 page breezy readable fun book some pages you laugh out loud some pages you say Donald Trump's a rascal and you know what I think you managed to be fair but not to not to suck up to Trump and not to be a gotcha critic either no no no I got that I tried to play it right down the middle and the true Trump is in fact a very entertaining person so a book about them should be rather yeah you know a president like no other that's sort of an ambiguous statement you could say that if you were Trump hater or a Trump lover yeah but he's such a but now we're in dispute that that is true yeah there's never been one like that of that country anyway a lot of people despise him what's interesting to me is a lot of his critics today ten years ago would have been his superfans or at least people who wanted to bask in his celebrity and his wealth well they'd see him is fine in his place as a sort of blowhard billionaire but but the idea that he wanted to take over the and kick at the people that he said it misgovernment the country for the last 15 years obviously that offends all those who identify with the people who've been established in office in both parties all that time you have an interesting and quick history of his family life a very interesting family and there was oh you say it beautifully there's always been a drop of the Showboat in the American culture a little bit more than our Canadian culture considerably more and it goes right to the start I mean the Declaration of Independence it's beautifully written by Thomas Jefferson but Minh the midst of it there's a blood libel on the native people there is an indictment of poor old King George the third that makes him sound like someone who was on trial at nuremburg and he wasn't he wasn't a terribly competent King but he wasn't an evil man for heaven sakes and and and and the and the Americans were the first important country in the world that weren't defined by a culture unique to them I mean the French spoke French the Spanish but Spanish and so forth in the English were the British were the English being country these are the Americans as a substitute devised this theory that we are the first free country well of course they weren't they had no more civil liberties than the British of the Swiss or the Dutch or most of the Scandinavians but that was what they staked out and it's worked and if it works don't knock up in a way it was a country more about the future than the past exactly huh you know and the history of Trump would you call the swashbuckler you use a lot of great adjectives yeah he's certainly that and impresario that you know and at the worst sort of a carnival guy you know I mean a Baxter but a PT Barnum on all of that but also Statesman he runs the gamut he run yeah maybe he in some ways he's a slightly down market salesman but in some ways is a great patriotic American leader and that's the thing it's interesting right now there's a question of black America can they embrace Trump and you've seen Kanye West and others break with the taboo and consider Republicans and it's funny because until very very recently Donald Trump was the star subject of hundreds of rap songs because in some ways he embodied the audacious American dream get rich live fancy I mean he wasn't part of the gun culture and he was sort of anti-establishment which they identified with well that's how is it possible to be a blue-collar billionaire because the blue-collar thing it may really it's not as if he ever worked with a blue-collar on but the blue color aspect in the way you mean it is a person not interested in spending all this time going to opera committees and being in the social pages of the New York Times he's someone who who started relatively modestly in socio-economic terms and made a billion dollars but still has they sort of everyman mentality and relates to the people you know there's a little passage in your book about how to save money he would mix his own extermination poison just when he was for the cockroaches yeah yes oh sorry that don't leave your viewers he got his hands dirty in some but his father said look we don't have to go and buy this stuff we can make it ourselves and that's what he did there's this famous what we have to get rid of the roaches forget of roaches nerve buildings but we can make our own you know whether the insecticide yeah but what told me what was interesting to me is that other people especially those you didn't come from he came from some wealth yeah and the idea that he would literally get his hands dirty was something that many people would find either off-putting or two grubby his it was a well his father was a wealthy man median start as a wealthy man and and and they didn't they they weren't the wealthy New York that the world knows they weren't man happening they were Brooklyn and Queens say that a very comfortable as his father had to Cadillac limousines license New York state license f1 and f2 F T one and a half away from their interim and so they clearly weren't poor but but and he went to Fordham University and Oh Horton University of Pennsylvania so and in prior to that he he matriculated from a New York State Military Academy so absolutely was not a race to riches story but it was never the the socio-economic top his father was never socially prominent he went he went to the construction sites his famous pictures of Trump with a hardhat in the site now any boss could could come through but I think I think he dealt with enough frontline people grassroots people to keep that sensibility esra on his holidays even in high school he would work for his father on construction sites not in the office on construction sites Donald knows how to build a building and he knows every phase of it and then and including he went to Wharton because it was the only business school that had a specialty course in real estate including construction hmm the only one and and and so he sought from absolutely the most basic position working with his father's work grace right up through University you know Charles Murray the green American as a scholar I know wrote about coming apart which one was blue and how the white working-class has being disconnected from the fancy Manhattan la cultural capitals and you developed a quiz called how thick is your bubble and there's questions in it that are sort of startling I mean like have you ever been on a factory floor yeah have you ever worked at a job with physical labor that you come home and your body is sore like questions like that that remind liberals maybe you don't know maybe your leftist but you don't know the working-class I felt and I think of Donald Trump and I we've got some video clips of Trump over the years I'd like to play one for you before you do if I miss any one thing I know Charles Murray and he was here in Toronto several months ago and there's a dinner firm of quite a large dinner that I went to and they invited questions after he'd spoken so I asked him and this was very shortly after Trump was inaugurated and I asked him if it were not the case that if he succeeded in what he was trying to do it would possibly reverse the trend he was described he said absolutely if he succeeds it will reverse it because he is not out of touch and there's a respect that he respects working men and women absolutely in a way that traditional liberals would put them like in a glass case of the museum and wouldn't want to touch them for fear they had mixed the rat poison though they would profess sympathy for them as a group but not wish to associate with them as individually and there's one little clip and I use it from time to time on my shows it was at a rally I think it was in West Virginia we should is about something that's almost as dirty in the mind of the fancy set as an exterminators pesticide and that is cold it's just a very simple moment but let me show you a quick clip I'd like to talk about your style Trump talking about disco look at that jump disco that's true that's true you know what a contrast between Hillary Clinton who in one of her debates said there's going to be a lot of coal miners out of work Barack Obama the same thing they say they're for the working class the working poor but only if it's I don't know the kind of aesthetically fashionable jobs Trump digs coal that's a shocking thing to say in today's environmental era but he always said beautiful clean coal but you know President Obama when he was running for the office and and in the primaries in eight nine years ago running against Hillary Clinton when she won in Pennsylvania made those disparaging remarks about blue-collar Pennsylvanians who took out their frustrations in their lives with guns and religion I mean I think that is pulling you away cling to their Bible that was afraid yeah baby I mean that's much closer to the disparagement those people feel they might in their minds think we want to better their lot they're not they're not living well we want to help them they might be sincere in that but I don't identify with a man they're idiots you know what are the things that's so good I found that Trump takes coal calm and interesting for two reasons first of all it's one thing to even say you're with a coal miner because that's that's an obsolete old school that's that's dirty that's doesn't your face it'll call her white man stuff that's not coding in Silicon Valley so it's uncool to begin with but then Trump actually meant it and he pulled the United State out of out of the Paris global warming which was the dumbest treaty in Houston ever ival only by the Iran nuclear treaty I think everyone knows the Paris Club were warming Treaty is sort of a sham but it's like the emperor has no clothes oh you can't say that or it's the third Trump old America and the sky didn't fall this guy didn't fall and meanwhile the country's left behind who were advanced countries are now having intense discussions amongst themselves but what they are going to do but the hundred billion dollars a year the China and India the world's greatest polluters fast growing economies are expecting from them I would ask you about this plain-spoken this and there's a few quotes from your book I want to give this so much to cover I tell you it was hard for me to find excerpts from the book because so many things were I want to tell you let me pick one from random and thank your for your kind oh you know what I I was a warm IT I was nervous when I got this book I thought this is gonna be heavy-duty I loved every page let me read something I think you nailed it I think you nailed it a lot of people say how Trump is insulting he he has rude nicknames he's he's you know he uses words like he calls country all bolts and stuff I want to read a paragraph by the way I think it was outs enough that's right which is slightly that's right yeah you're afraid one of the things he's so good and I think is a Manhattan thing is nicknames you give people a nickname when it sticks they're doomed but he's got that New York yeah yeah I mean okay let me let me read from the book instead of leaking research and gossip about rivals Trump just trotted rumors out directly no matter how frivolous thus as time went by to establish that Senator Lindsey Graham had given his private cell phone number to Trump he gave it to a crowd of Allison and he repeated spurious stories about Ted senator Ted Cruz's father having had an association with Lee Harvey Oswald and you go on and give more examples and but but I think the key is your first point there every politician does that but they just leak those insults or accusations or wild gossip through surrogates they plant stories here their Trump just comes out and says it right and it's shocking but at the same time it's absolutely refreshing and honesty what I think about Elvis it all together honest but I agree it's refreshing like candid minoo and you're perfectly right are they I mean Franklin D Roosevelt was always above the fray but he had he had some of his entourage who were specialists and absolutely harpooning the opponent's you say but his his fingerprints were never on it but you know did Trump's not like that I want to play a clip from a debate it's I'm laughing when I shouldn't laugh you know II tries to get people to laugh but he's good at it well and that's things he said you're laughing out of shock because he says something you're not supposed to but then you're laughing because if there's a grain of truth to it it's gonna stick and when he low energy Jeb it's because you think yeah he's sort of low-energy let me play a clip here's him versus Hillary Clinton and he's saying something you should never say take a look she doesn't have the look she doesn't have the stamina I said she doesn't have the stamina and I don't believe she does have the stamina to be president of this country you need tremendous stamina Hillary has experienced but it's bad experience we have been saying Hillary Clinton has no stamina and she was just 10 feet away from him and she was smiling that rictus grin but you know what I think it clicked and there were some health scares for Hillary Clinton when she fainted on camera you know going after the 9/11 Memorial Day yeah and and so that there were and she said she'd had pneumonia for a few days so there was a problem and you know we see later in some of the access to information documents that came out how often she was napping she was taking naps every day sleeping I mean and I don't know if that's something more serious but Trump just put out there what are the under noose they just sort of murmurs he just and he does that on Twitter in a way and the side of it as he does have superhuman stamina he almost never sleeps he works all the time even people who don't like him at all admit that he is astonishingly persevering and strong physically huh it is quite something it's hard to believe I think he's actually a year older than Hillary Clinton if I think more than the year it's a he's just about to turn 72 or just as and I think she's just coming up to 70 I and he looks more vigorous than she does I I want to say something else because again until you put this in words one of the things I value I mean I followed on from closely as so many as the whole world not sure and I think I fall in closely because I'm the journalist and I sense things but one of the things I like the best about your book as you crystallize my hunch into it oh that's right I didn't see that way let me quote something that I really found valuable Trump has learned something about how to gain and hold the respect that is naturally available to the chief of state and the country has somewhat got used to him I think you're right there and here's the key there are markedly fewer malapropisms there have been no bungled foreign initiatives fewer indiscretions his economic nanak program is working and as enemies are largely a tired coalition of character assassinate assassins and hacks but let me come back to that first point markedly fewer malapropisms no fewer indiscretion everyone tries to hang Trump is so mouthy he's so lippy but when you think about it the other than the the blunt list he hasn't screwed it up he had and you would think a guy who's always tweeting and shooting from the hip would blow it up yes I'm going mad but early on there were some tweets that were ill-considered but they're very few of them now and and okay this may be just need but my impression is when you see him now he has both hands in the podium you see the sealer office on the podium and he looks and sounds like a president I mean he's very fluent and and he speaks with authority and and and not in that somewhat boastful manner that he used to him and when the question was raised about the Nobel Prize he said look that's a nice thought but it's premature what I want is a victory for everybody for the whole world not a prize for me now that was a very intelligent presidential thing to say and he might not have said that two years ago and by the way there's no chance he's going to get that that's a small committee of the Norwegian I'll give it to Al Gore and Jimmy Carter and Iraq Obama just for getting elected yeah getting up it's a political gift yeah but the presidents they should have given it to President Truman President Eisenhower President Kennedy President Nixon they didn't give it to him you started the very first thing in your book is you dedicated to the presidents you have no you list them LBJ Nixon Reagan George HW Bush maybe I'm missing one in there yeah and that the fact is I knew Jimmy Carter and I and I knew George W Bush but I I must say I didn't I didn't want to say this but I didn't particularly respect them as president as men yes but not as presidents where's the others I did admire them how did you get to know and need to Trump because I want to ask you a little bit about him well because we owned the Chicago my associates and I owned the Chicago sun-times and they've had a low-rise building in downtown Chicago it was clearly a crime site to develop and it had been owned by Marshall Field the department store a company and then person and and so he had a louver I serve almost a you know with escalators or other elevators it was almost like a department store so the Trump organization's bid was the best did and that's how I got to know him and all my American directors said you know hang on to your wallet this man's a scoundrel and so on but he came in exactly on time exactly on budget build a very much admired building 98 stories had the place full six months before it opened he was the best partner I ever had and then then we stayed friendly after that we were neighbors in both New York and Palm Beach and he was very loyal to me and my legal difficulties volunteered to come and give testimony for me and and so would you know we're friends Ivan so I haven't seen him lately and I obviously don't bother him in his present position but but we you know we were friends before I have a theory I would like to on you my theory about Trump and why he gets away with not malapropisms but his bluntness the the comment for example or his criticism here's my theory unlike Hillary Clinton who for example I don't know if you remember that clip when she laughed before the camera was on about we Came we saw we killed Mon market ganado so there was a public hillary in a private hillary there was the hillary that's that acted very presidential and then there was the brutal hillary behind the scenes like the one who gave this the secret speech to the south american bankers but open borders never involve denying at all yeah the one who would give speeches said and take the big dough from wall street and then demon my theory is a donald trump is absolutely the same in private in public yeah absolutely the same level of audacity profanity brutality humor and and that's my theory tell me tell me what you see is what you get at agree with which is like anything else like you like all of us in our jobs we get better at it as we hold it longer and work at it and you know he's seeming of more like a president than he did the day started but but you're absolutely right that the donald trump one knows is the one one sees well what you what he is surprising to people know him are these poor trails of him as a horrible evil man i mean he isn't that although i mean he's he's a tough businessman but but he is a you know a hard driving of man who's his objectives are reasonable and commendable your second last paragraph in the whole block i'm not going to give it away there's so many great i don't want to give it away but this i think you nail it with president Trump no setback is admitted or accepted he's defiant for him rebuffs are really victories disguised victories moral victories or the prey leads to victories hyperbole truthful and otherwise is his common parlance he speaks for the people he has been a very successful man and he's repeatedly outwitted his opponents which is why he's attacked with such snobbery you know Sabri used against a billionaire as in the snobs attack a billionaire normally say the way around envy and the spice and spitefulness but America is reversing its decline and wrenching itself loose from the habits of lassitude elitist decay that's a mix of things there because normally snobs don't hate a billionaire they want to be a billionaire how much of it's jealousy it's hard to be precise about that I think I think there is there was condescension to him before as a Vulgaria once he was elected president the envy became a tremendous in crustacean on the minds of a great many wealthy people who had thought of him as a cultural inferior person even though he was in in terms of his wealth parallel to themselves but now that he is the 43rd direct successor to General George Washington as president I think the envy is the size of what used to be called Mount McKinley I believe President Obama changed just some native name I'd like the fact that no setback is admitted and if it's a defeat it's just a victory in the success he's never defeated yeah you just fight on I know Bama care repeal that he just fought on a knee and he did get the mandate the coercive part of it canceled in his tax bill so he you know he just he just never gives up I I was worried I mean I learned from your book I guess I should have known but I didn't know it that he really seriously considered Ross Perot as Reform Party as a as an option he considered the Democrats he looked so he's he's always been an outsider my fear when he won us I thought geez he doesn't have deep roots in Washington he's all these insiders are gonna run circles around him and I felt like that's how his first six months sort of was until he put his own people around him but also is really the you know he had attacked the whole system both parties and all factions both parties including the the Republican leaders in the Congress and most of the Republican senators and congressmen and and so for the first six months they just sat in their hands they didn't do anything to put his program but you see all the never tremors you're leaving about 30 of them are not running again Ryan's going corker flake and so forth and he they're in lockstep behind him now trying to get his program through so he's either you know it's it was a war on the whole system he won the nomination then he won the election now he's won over the congressional Republicans you take it in stages we're talking with Conrad Black the book is called Donald J Trump a president like no other by Regnery it's available online we'll have the link for Amazon underneath this video I I think one of the reasons Trump may be successful you allude to it being in real estate in New York City you're not working with you know Swiss you know anchors that's right it's not it's not angels it's not an industry dominated by angels let me just read a line I'd like you to expand on this Donald Trump is not a blundering reactionary but a battle-hardened veteran a very difficult business is full of unethical people and he's don't Eagle Scout himself he is a very tough and almost Demiurge eclis energetic man I got a look that word up his personality is so startling and at times garish that there's a large section of the population that will not warm to him that's right but if his persistence brings continued success he will accede to the support of majority I think the reason he can stare down Kim jong-un oh that's that's still in progress the reason he can stare down the UN on the climate be s the reason he may succeed with Iran is because he's used to dealing with some of the toughest guys including the mob which was in the construction business and the casino business cut I think he's the first even not the first he's the biggest bruiser in that office since maybe Teddy Kennedy at any Roosevelt what do you think he's a church done to his platform in one of the Ohio cities I if I forget to date you it would be assassinated yeah not the Lord not Cleveland or Cincinnati one of those other oh my Oh cities a his first reaction wasn't sort of timorous though it was it was a hardening of his fists and turning him towards his person unsecure see physically a big man he looks like yes you so yeah and so other than the end and well with his doctors who advised him to lose some weight he's quite muscular he plays golf all with that means he he's he's a strong man and and he does to use his word have the stamina some of the yeah I think you're you're probably right you mentioned Theodore Roosevelt because he was a rancher and a man of and an explorer and a person who required a great deal of himself physically so some others were very strong in other ways I mean Franklin because he lost the use of his legs yeah you know he had bigger biceps and Jack Dempsey massive chest business upper body did everything you're saying that's that sort of run his crutches so he propelled himself around but but but he is Donald Trump certainly is a you know he's a can-do let's get it done yeah used to dealing with bad dudes and I I think that the John Kerry's of the world who said well but article 42 of the UN treaty and Trump is no time for that he knows BS when he sees it and he sees a con man in Kim Jong Un's approach so it's not just a face it's a straight correlation of forces so he's the president of the u.s. and he knows the power of the United States he's not afraid to threaten to use it and let us face facts a Barack Obama didn't think that way I mean he had his qualities but but the idea of approaching different countries with diverging motives to those of the US interests and saying in effect look here I I you know I'm I represent on him the commander in chief of the greatest military power in the world and I won't stand for this that was not how he operated had Donald will did I remember when Barack Obama was photographed holding a book I think was by Fareed Zakaria called the post American president most American that is the exact opposite of Trump's slogan make America great again post American world I remember when Obama was asked and as first NATO meaning do you believe in American exceptionalism he said yeah the same way the Greeks believe in Greek exceptional is I don't remember the exact I wouldn't wear the American flag exact opposite of Trump now maybe you wouldn't have had from you didn't have a mama first yeah and and George W George W you know really brought on the economic crisis and and even though they were Clinton's measures the housing bubble but he you know he sat there for eight years until it blew out and and he was rather indiscriminate in his use of military force and then you add to that Obama's flatlining the economy and his passivity and and frankly weakness and foreign policy the self dissolving red line and that kind of thing and and if the Americans just couldn't take it anymore the key metric in my opinion was GDP growth per capita went from four-and-a-half percent with Reagan three point nine with Clinton two with George Tobia one percent with Obama and Americans will not settle for that they won't stand for it yeah manok the decline and again this is something we talked a little bit about charles murray the fancy class can handle the decline or they don't see the decline they're not in decline you know i want to you've been very generous with your time today I want to I want to talk a little bit about something that purists consider conservatives libertarians would have criticized before and that is Trump's an economic nationalist not just so he threatens to upset the pure libertarian globalism on economics and a Milton Friedman type and all of a think-tank conservatives would be opposed to it let me show you a clip I think this is fascinating this is from The Oprah Winfrey Show in 1988 so what's that thirty years ago and back then the economic challenger to America was Japan not China but I think if you swapped China in you could play the same today and it would be Trump in 2018 there's also a reference to Kuwait Trump has similar thoughts about OPEC today here without further ado here's a clip from Trump on Oprah thirty years ago I got a full-page ad in major US newspapers last year criticizing US foreign policy what would you do differently Don I'd make our allies forgetting about the enemies the enemies you can't talk to so easily I'd make our allies pay their fair share we're a debtor nation something's going to happen over the next number of years with this country because you can't keep going on losing two hundred billion and yet we we let Japan come in and dump everything right into our markets and everything it's not free trade if you ever go to Japan right now and try to sell something forget about it out but just forget about it it's almost impossible they don't have laws against it they just make it impossible they come over here they sell their cars their VCRs they knock the hell out of our companies and hey I have tremendous respect for the Japanese people I mean you can respect somebody that's beaten the hell out of you but they are beating the hell out of this country Kuwait they live like kings the poorest person in Kuwait they live like kings and yet they're not paying we make it possible for them to sell their oil why aren't they paying us 25 percent of what they're making it's a joke isn't that interesting that kind of talk market free market Pierce was terrible you're going to throw the world back in a recession I note that America is booming unemployment is low it's at record lows for blacks and Hispanics and industrial companies are reassuring Apple repatriated a quarter of a trillion dollars manufacturing was coming back and he actually hasn't other than his new squabble with China he actually hasn't done anything other than used to bully pulpit yet the deregulated to encourage investment and and change the psychology man half of economics is psychology he's changed that the the soft point is workforce participation at sixty two point eight percent that should be a bit higher but you remember on his trade thing he's all for trade but he doesn't like her trade imbalances he wants the United States to export more rather than the others to export less to the US as long as long as it's fair trade I mean let's just look in one sentence of Mexico that is a trade surplus with the u.s. of sixty five billion dollars they were facilitating the entry into the United States of a family on completely unskilled people they may be good people but unskilled people illy going every year and and they were enticing American factories away to have just inside the Mexican border and then encourage them to export back into the US creating unemployment in the United States and encourage them to retain their profit to Mexico so they didn't pay taxes leave us now you don't blame the Mexicans for doing what they can but the United States doesn't have to put up with that it's 20 times as powerful countries in Mexico and that's not fair trade it's interesting I mean on Twitter you can search individual people what how many times have used the word China Iran I went through every single tweet Donald Trump's ever written on China boy he's written a lot and there they were I'm talking about tweets 5 years ago when he was not really and be careful I'm on the campaign mode though he did say to the New York Times some months ago the the when I asked him this directly he said yes the fact is I've gone gently on China on the economic side because the number one crisis at the moment is North Korea and we need them there and and this is nothing but the truth well you're right but he's also not afraid to call them out when they for example they broke the North Korean embargo boy he came down on it so that's that what that same bluntness that we saw against Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush in a tweet he'll call out Little Rock a man in North Korea in a tweet he'll say I've had it with giving money to the Palestinians in a tweet yeah he'll say what everyone knew who fired the Secretary of State Network yeah on China to stand up for industries that no one would care about again these are the blue-collar folks do Wisconsin Pennsylvania and they're just supposed to roll over and yield to the forces of history states haven't voted Republican in a generation I don't think the Democrats have got again I think they're still pandering to the coastal elites and Hollywood and and hadn't I think they're a few of them who still think they can destroy the Trump administration and and there are some who think this is their opportunity to get ahead of the future and take the Democratic Party far to the left you know the Elizabeth Warren Bernie Sanders left but I think the great sort of center of that party is very confused right now we're almost out of time and I appreciate you spending it with us I've really enjoyed this I'm I loved this book I loved it I I mean I knew I'd like it but I didn't think he would it's it's the best book I've read I mean Jordan Peterson's book I'm a super fan of that yeah it's a very very different that's very different this it made it come and you know what to see all the sniping attacks on Trump catalogued and you you only had that one oh yeah that one and they each they're like a fruit fly they have a very short life and you almost forgot and as I saw them catalog they're just the Motordrome the Charlottesville business I mean nobody remembers now in theory the argument was that he was going soft on the Q Klux Klan er than that season but this is nonsense no one could believe such rubbish well I maybe that's a reason why the media it has fallen in the polls in terms of people's trust for it but the media doesn't know that so they think they are the arbiters of whether or not truncal one really frustration is that he's used the social media to it with I mean he issues a tweet 45 million people get it at once and their research the president's research is that those people send it on within 10 minutes to at least 45 million more so 90 million people are in almost direct touch with the president in 10 minutes well let me ask you about that I'm gonna move away from your book now I'd love it and I recommended the book is called a president like no other you can get it on Amazon we'll have a link below Twitter Facebook YouTube helped win brexit I don't think the social media Titans figure that out Trump won that way certainly not the fancy I mean New York Times two weeks in advance was saying 92% Chancellor is going to win and I think shortly after Trump won when the people said what went wrong they said social media they started to crack down they deleted 30,000 Facebook pages from marine lepen in France we see Silicon Valley really tightening up mainly on conservatives I haven't seen any liberal taken down for that well Google starting to take the heat for being a left-wing operation well and Mark Zuckerberg when he testified it gave him a pretty good roasting but they didn't do anything other than they roasted him so here's my question to you Donald Trump wins because he goes around the media direct to the people but if he doesn't we taught me mention briefly Teddy Roosevelt will Donald Trump take on these this oligopoly these extremely powerful people as powerful in our day as Genie Rockefeller Bezos as the one who's focused on look I don't know I mean remember this is right you know you've got to respect the First Amendment of many people have the right to say what they want mean less and and he no one's going to tamper with that but I I think what he will not hesitate to do is focus the irritation of his followers and himself other and even now you know every week is you know he goes out into the middle of the country to Oklahoma or Arkansas or Iowa or something he was in Michigan last week I think and I'm in rural Michigan and but they can pack at the local Stadium in a big stadium and any harangues his supporters from but ninety minutes but it's all over national television and and and then he at some point he points at the press box and says they are the authors of these lies you send people shake their fist so he'll do that but if you mean actually try and legislate against political opponents in business no I don't think that would work well well what about the web and it shouldn't work I love the First Amendment I wish we had it in Canada I think it's our greatest flaw as a country in Canada not having it I'm talking about and maybe I'm getting too technical here but it would be like a telephone company listening to your conversation saying oh you're at you we're gonna shut you off now because you're saying things on our telephone we don't like so they're no longer a platform they're a publisher what happens when Facebook that he would act against well I feel like that's where we're going it sounds like maybe you you don't see this as grave a thought a threaded the truth is I don't follow it as much as you probably do but I think if it is happening I would see it as great as you described but it that if that is what they're doing public opinion would support anything I think that's the greatest threat to his reelection there's one more the president's ability to mobilize public opinion any president if he knows doing is very great I have one last question because I know our time is up I've said before and I'd like your reaction to this I've said if Donald Trump builds the wall no matter what he'll be reelected if he does not build the wall no matter what he will not be reelected what do you think of that I think the wall is essential to his credibility to his base to the economic partners five more in the security part of his platform and his war against the fancy opinion set what do you think III agree with one slight modification it doesn't actually have to be physically a wall he asked to create the border and if because of the shekinah in the Congress he can't get the wall done if he if he deploys military and paramilitary units to make sure that the illegal entries are reduced to practically none he he'll fulfill his promise saying he's doing that as he continues to work to build the wall but I I think I think I'd put I'd flip the coin also in this way he is going to go after the Democrats as the party of open borders let anyone come in let them vote even if they're not citizens and it is as they claim improper to allow census takers to ask people if they are in fact citizens which is just the in comprehensible he's going to hang that around their neck like a toilet seat and he's gonna kill him but if he abandoned the immigration issue I agree he would go down but he's not going to do that I hope you're right well this I've enjoyed this time has flown I've got about three hundred more questions we're gonna save for another day I loved the book I wouldn't say that if I didn't love it I would I would have said I liked it but I loved it it's I think it's the every Trump supporter needs to read it because it's an antidote to so much of the poison out and it's not it's not a love letter it's fair yeah it's a good and you're a good faith critic yeah I mean what Donald didn't get on anyone's nerves including mine but you know there is well I really enjoyed the book folks it's called a president like no other Donald Trump the author is Conrad black who spent the last nearly an hour with me I've enjoyed it now you can get it on Amazon dot CA or com will have the links below and we'll be back with our regular format tomorrow
