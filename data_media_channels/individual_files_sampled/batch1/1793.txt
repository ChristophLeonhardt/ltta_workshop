Iraq's second largest university remains scarred reminders of the fight against ISIL are everywhere in Mosul but the bombed out rooms and charred corridors don't prevent young people in motion from seeking a better future they're a cross-section of Iraq's diverse society from all communities including son Nisha and Christian as in most parts of Iraq opinion about whether to vote is divided I'd encourage all people to think outside the box and go and vote decisions must be based on integrity and not on sectarian or ethnic lines while others disagree it is better if we boycott the elections the main reason for boycotting is that I have not found anyone fit for office for leading Iraq young people in the capital Baghdad also have mixed opinions about whether the election will bring change almost 60 percent of Iraq's population is under 27 years old and many faced a lack of opportunities and limited prospects but in a country where opinion seems to be divided there seems to be consensus amongst the youth that there needs to be change at the top in the run-up to the election the government has banned discussions on politics in all public universities but opinions can't be silenced I hope that we can have a bit of situation than now and I hope whoever is elected can bring change to improve things that's why we have to vote there are no services no security in Iraqis have no status in the world open a nice man who changed the constitution and change the government we have to get one president not not everyone gets the opportunity for higher education but many of those who do cannot find jobs Amarula we graduated from Baghdad University five years ago despite his frustration with Iraqi politics he hasn't lost hope do I feel optimistic that the situation of the elections will be very different I will say no but there will be a small change and that's a step in the right direction and with that cautious optimism young Iraqis get ready to elect another government hoping politicians will rise above sectarian divisions and corruption to work towards a better Iraq Solomon Javed al Jazeera like that
