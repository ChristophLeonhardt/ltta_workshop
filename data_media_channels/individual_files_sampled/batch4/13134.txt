it's Christmastime at last and many people are returning to their Bibles to read once again the ancient story of God's love for his creation but what do they know personally I prefer to page through the Flyers and catalogs I get in the mail and read the great gospel story there as I understand it one day and ancient Galilee or some such place an angel appeared to the Virgin Mary where she lay on her bed and the angel said to her behold Mary there's an amazing sale at jcpenney with sheets and bedding being offered up to 50% off also you're pregnant and Mary arose and said Wow I better get to the mall right away wait what but by then the angel had disappeared now a decree went out from Caesar saying that all men must be counted so they could pay their fair share of Caesars mansions and dancing girls unless there be like inequality or something and I'm hearing this decree Joseph the carpenter brought his ass from the stable and put a padded saddle on it because he knew dealing the Caesar would give his ass of pain and when Joseph arrived in Bethlehem Mary gave birth to a son and laid him in a manger and by some miracle the animals began to speak and said to her we hear there are some incredible bargains on cribs at Ethan Allen which is great because frankly we'd like our manger back so we can get something to eat meanwhile a choir of angels appeared to some shepherds singing glory and the highest best buy is offering Sony TVs for as much as 30% off which is not even to mention the fact that the savior of the world has been born in Bethlehem so you might want to stop off there as well and the shepherds went forth rejoicing shouting hallelujah 30% off of Sony also that other thing they said sounded good too but I forget now what it was and wise men came from the east and visited the Holy Family saying our sacred books have told us that there are tremendous savings here in Bethlehem and Mary said to them yes truly my son has come to save all mankind and the wise men said actually we were thinking more about a deal on power tools and maybe a workbench and they went home by another way and that's the story of why every year at this time we celebrate the coming of a jolly fat man who brings toys to all the girls and boys also we remember the child born in Bethlehem for some reason but the important point is the toys lots and lots of toys cash makes a very nice gift as well and so as Tiny Tim observed god bless us everyone because otherwise we are in big big trouble trigger warning I'm Andrew Klavan and this is the Andrew Klavan that's it we're done there's that there is the drummer drumming Austin's 12 days of clay it's putting the Clavin back in Christmas I think is Wow the year is what a year what an amazing year 2016 has been and we have been here through every step of the way I mean this is just we're gonna take a look back at the year Crick looks at the best and the worst or my favorites and least favorites and we're gonna have a Christian todo one of the very few film critics out there with conservative values will come on and in the second half of the show and you know what we're gonna stay on Facebook the whole time just as our Christmas present to you as you can see we wrapped it and everything though the whole place but that doesn't mean you shouldn't subscribe you should all right let's take a look we had come to the end of with a country having two entirely different experiences one is the experience of Michelle Obama here she is your husband's administration everything the election was all about hope do you think that this administration achieved that yes I do because we feel the difference now yeah see now we're feeling what not having hope feels like you know hope is necessary it's it's a necessary concept and Barack didn't just talk about hope because he thought it was just a nice slogan to get votes I mean he and I and so many believe if you what else do you have if you don't have hope okay so that's what half the country they have the country that is concentrated in California and New York they found they figured out I think if you took away California in New York Trump won this election by something like three million votes is that what it is it's like some some really large number he won the election so in California and New York which we I think can safely call the collection where the elites collect these are the the archipelago of the elites hope is gone there these people are hopeless on the other hand here's Donald Trump talking about hope to his supporters Michelle Obama said yesterday that there's no hope but I assumed she was talking about the past not the future because I'm telling you we have tremendous hope and we have tremendous promise and tremendous potential we are going to be so successful as a country again we are going to be amazing and I actually think she made that statement not meaning it the way it came out I really do because I met with President Obama and Michelle Obama in the White House my wife was there she could not have been nicer I honestly believe she meant that statement in a different way than it came in because I believe I believe there is tremendous hope and beyond hope we have such potential that was actually kind of uncharacteristically generous of Trump right there he didn't go to his usual pugilistic mode because that's exactly what she meant she meant that with the election of Donald Trump don't Trump all yeah whatever Donald Trump all hope is gone we abandon all hope ye who trumping and enter here you will enter into the trumpian universe and that is the way that California and New York are feeling and the rest of the country and many of us are feeling that actually no we are feeling a thrill of hope as the christmas carol says so what's the difference and the difference has to do with exactly why I ended up voting for Donald Trump even though I ended up voting for him reluctantly it has to do exactly why let me tell you my least favorite and my most favorite moment of this year politically speaking politically my least favorite moment came very early on in the year in February I'm sitting with my wife in a cafe in Santa Barbara and we just went up there for you know to have a pleasant day and we're sitting having having coffee and sandwich and I have different people react to bad news in different ways there's some people I've seen like you they hear someone has died or something and they just burst into tears they get it immediately some people shut down I just go into this moment of deep deep stillness when I hear something really that shakes me I just go into this deep stillness and I starts to assess I know I'm gonna have to feel the pain eventually but I feel it like over sort of I sort of let it leak into my system bit by bit instead of just feeling the blow right away I felt like that I went to that stillness when this man the announcement came that this man had died this was cut seven much of the harm that has been done in recent years by activist constitutional interpretation is made possible by a theory which says that unlike an ordinary law which doesn't change it means what it meant when it was enacted and what always mean that unlike that the Constitution changes from decade to decade to comport with and this is a phrase we use in our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence we the court does to comport with quote the evolving standards of decency that marked the progress of a maturing society other words we have a morphing Constitution and of course it's up to the court to decide when it morphs and how it works that's generally paraded as the quote living Constitution and unfortunately that philosophy has made enormous headway not only with lawyers and judges but even with John Q public and that of course is for those who aren't watching as Antonin Scalia Justice Antonin Scalia talking to my good friend Peter Robinson the best talk show host anywhere who should be on PBS if there were if anything were fair but Scalia's death struck me so hard because it changed the entire nature of the election that was coming I am NOT as anyone who listens knows I am NOT a catastrophist I'm not somebody who gets hysterical thinks the end of the country is coming I was not somebody who thought Barack Obama had destroyed America I in fact in fact I thought one of the salient points about Barack Obama is that everything he's done has failed and when things fail people fix them it's only when P things are successful that you know it was it was the fact that and Caesar Augustus was successful that ended the Roman Republic if he had failed the Roman Republic would have been brought back it was only the fact that Hitler's invasions and his economic policies were successful at first that solidified his his standing Barack Obama has failed at everything and everything I think he has done will be erased so I didn't think that a disaster come but I realized that this that the court was up for grabs and the left can appoint justices who will erase the Second Amendment and the First Amendment in a heartbeat so it turned what would have been a change election into an Ono election turned it made the stakes very high and you know I really was looking at them as I you know people were saying oh my god alex jones i remember oh my god he was murdered and all this stuff because they couldn't accept the fact that bad news is like this is meaningless you know it's just like comes out of the blue he was an old man with heart trouble he knew he didn't have long to live and it was just one of those tragic things that really changed the entire face of the election here was my favorite moment of the election this it had to be let me just see what cut this is this is number nine cut number nine it was Donald Trump versus almost all the experts and as of right now it looks like Donald Trump was right how do we explain those that I'm not sure you kid okay I just think that we should have seen this coming America is crying tonight this is the time for real wisdom you want real wisdom I don't have that to offer at this hour the path here is getting to be very narrow it's hopeless with terrible values and then competence galore this is a sadness it is a a mourning moment and it's um you know if nothing how do we explain how this is possible we've overlooked rural America a bit too much no one counted the yard signs are in a weird weird situation right now and it is a it is a moment filled with fear do the brains that got this guy elected president tonight apply to being a good president I hope there's some connection otherwise we have a dingbat his presence tonight is hard to put into perspective the salty tears of the mainstream media I drank them like champagne it was so good it was better than the fact that Trump won it was not it wasn't maybe not better than the fact that Republicans won across the country in every aspect and every place where they were up for grabs but the salty tears and bitterness and fear and anger of the mainstream media was a delight and this speaks to what why what the division in the country is why one side of the country is hopeless and the other is filled with hope and why I ultimately voted for Trump leftism is decay leftism is decadence leftism is a gathering of the spoils that came from conservatism and distributing them and just you know just doling them out it's saying don't cut down that tree to build that city because that tree can never be replaced it's it's a it's a the death of energy it is regulations that stop people from inventing things it's oh please don't do that don't say that don't go there don't think that it's it's all it is all the things that stop a vibrant living country from exploding with growth and getting greater and greater and greater and here's the thing this is an observation made by one of my favorite thinkers on earth he's no longer on earth but one of my favorite thinkers who visited earth was Jack Paar's Anna and Jacque parson have pointed out that decayed decadence is good for elites elites like decadence it's very pleasant there's lots of sex and any mistakes can be paid for they have the money to pay for any mistakes they make and erase any mistakes and you know take care of their mistresses take care of their abortions and all this stuff there's lots of inequality and the elites are on the good side of that and when the in decadence people become very far apart and elites are having a great time they were they're doing fine the stock market that's why Barack Obama the other day said oh the economy is growing meaning the stock market was high that's not the same thing as they're being jobs there's lots of entertainment becomes very sick and full of you know nihilistic sexual twisted stuff and elites love that you know yeah it's getting down to the real reality of this you know this is what I saw and what I saw in Hillary Clinton left and when I say the elites I'm in clue myself I am an elite everybody here at the daily wire is an elite we are people who work in the chattering classes it is very comfortable for us when PJ O'Rourke said he was voting for Hillary Clinton because she was awful but she was awful within normal bounds that's what he meant this decadence was very very comfortable and and that is the thing that Donald Trump blew up he blew it up the victory of Donald Trump blew it up he said we are not gonna go that's why that's why his slogan make America great again spoke directly into the concerns of the non elites the ordinary people the people who were suffering suffering now that means that makes this a quiet revolution it's not a real revolution they're on people in the streets thank God because you wouldn't like it believe me that may sound good but it ain't you know it is a this is an electoral democratic revolution revolutions are dangerous I am NOT saying they're not I have hopes and I have fears and I have hopes you know I mean I'm not sure what's gonna happen next but but revolutions happen for a reason and this one happened because we were not quite ready to go gentle into that good night and I am glad for that and that is what I am hoping for my hopes for the new year politically smaller government by cutting destroying regulation I have high hopes for that high hopes for that great Supreme Court nomination medium hopes I'm afraid that we'll have a good one and then the Senate will shut it down and Mitch McConnell won't have the guts to basically go in and Ram it through as it needs to and then trumple back off that's my fear my hope is that somehow they will stand tall and get it through my third hope Paul Ryan's reform agenda gets at least some traction that Paul Ryan can maybe do some deals with the dealmaker Trump and get something going moderate to low hopes I'm overlooked and I would like to see our Middle East policy become pragmatic but vigorous that's what I want I do not want to go to war with every country in the Middle East I do not want to be killing people for no reason that I can understand I do want to protect Israel it's the knife-edge of freedom and they're also God's people and so to pick their side just just saying just saying but you know they are the knife-edge of freedom we need to protect them I want to punish not only terrorists but terrorist regimes and I want to make sure we're safe at home I do have pretty high hopes of that Trump looks like right now that he's doing the right thing on that my fear my major fear one day Donald Trump and Paul Ryan are gonna clash and Paul Ryan and is and the Senate and that Congress are gonna clash in he the they're not gonna want to give President Trump what he wants and President Trump when he is thwarted becomes a bully and he says terrible things and he does terrible things he calls people names he lies about them he's we've seen this with him it is a personality flaw you know I he has many things that I really like about him his pragmatism his go-get-'em attitude all that stuff you know his political incorrectness love it love it all the bullying stuff is a personality defect and I'm afraid what I'm afraid of is that when that happens McConnell and Ryan will not have the support of the people and the problem there is not who wins the fight it is keeping our separation of powers intact and so we really hope I'm a little bit afraid that Ryan well and McConnell will not have the backbone to stand up against that onslaught my hope is however my hope is that in that moment the people will remember Antonin Scalia and will remember that the Constitution is Antonin Scalia said is not living it's dead meaning it means what it says and in that sense it is the Living Dead I hope that the Constitution and it's eternal values it's and it's brilliant brilliant defense of those eternal values will come to our rescue I actually believe that's gonna happen I actually do believe that I think we're gonna be okay there's gonna be some wacky moments coming ahead this guy is a wacky president but he's doing he's doing great so far I really like what he's doing so far and and yeah it's I have hope I'm gonna take it quick before we bring on Christian I'm just gonna ask him to hang on be a little patient I'm gonna go through my quick rundown of my favorites in culture I really my favorite book that I read this year and I had it on stuff I liked was secondhand time by the Nobel Prize when he winners that Lana Alekseyevich it is a series of interviews with people who lived through the fall of the Soviet Union and it's me as a religious guy it was a testimony to what happens to people when you forced them to live outside the truth not just the truth of how politics work not just that the truth of how human beings work but the ultimate truth of living without God and it is a terrible tragic and yet beautiful portrait of people whose souls whose souls have been twisted by being denied the simple truth that God is there and God loves them and God supports their individuality and their individualism and it is just a it's a beautiful beautiful piece of work it's all interviews it's oral history best best movies I think I think it allows a year for movies basically but yeah lousy year for movies but I really liked Hail Caesar the Coen brothers take off on the old movies great very funny very affectionate for the old movies and yet also had a true conservative message about work and faith that was great hell or high water was one of the best the shoot-'em-up story the it really was a Chris Pine and what's his name Ben Foster yeah both great in it but the real star for that was Taylor Sheridan the writer who also wrote Sicario just a great crime writer and he did a great job I also had a personal favorite was one of mine was 10 Cloverfield Lane which I just thought was such a good thriller so neat and tight and right and had the discovery of Mary Elizabeth Winstead who put in two who brought alive my theory that the greatest actresses the ones who become the big stars are the ones who show the most vulnerability and she just walked on stage and he wanted to take care of her from the split second she was on stage and every moment she was in danger was terrible best TV - easy picks obviously Game of Thrones best show ever made the Battle of the bastards was the great one of the great war scenes in all of cinematic history on screen just great not because of the way it was directed but because of the way it was well partly because of the way it was directed because you understood every single thing that was happening you understood everything that was at stake you understood every strategic move and it was so exciting so beautiful so brilliant the other was the last season of wrecked I really recommend this nobody's watching it because it's it's a little tough about a man who it's created by ray McKinnon an actor Aden young stars as a man who has been on death row for 20 years and then is released and it is just a beautiful intelligent touching moving show I think it's got some tough stuff my wife didn't want to watch it because of some of the sexual stuff in it but it's really just a soap opera but it's a soap opera with deep intelligence that stuff was really good let's bring on Kristian Toto one of my favorite critics he is I just want to make sure I he is the editor of Hollywood in Toto Hollywood in toto calm and he now has a new podcast are you there oh there is I can't hear you give me sound give me so wait we're can you hear him all right we're gonna call you back Christmas will go right back to you know this wasn't this wasn't a great year for for film but I think a lot of what's happening in film is moving over to television and for some of us that's difficult to watch because we like the movies we like going to the big screen and seeing all these things but if you're looking for human drama it is all on television and another one of my favorites has been the new series of black mirror that was called black yeah really good really spooky really scary and and that and that really has been that that's kind of been it is there anything I'm missing is it that I miss any movies that you loved that I can't think of it you guys love the Star Wars and the superheroes and Doctor Strange Doctor Strange yeah yeah it's not that I don't like those things I'll go back since we have to we have to vamp a little bit because Christian isn't with us two more of my favorite books raunch in Rose Washington biography which I had actually read before but I read again and one of the things I loved about this book especially in an election year was it reminded me that politics in America has always been insane I mean here was the guy here was George Washington who had an army he had the love of the people he had a government that hadn't been formed virtually anyone else on earth would have become King I really do believe that I don't believe they're ten men in history who would not have become King and instead he went to Congress laid down his sword turns his sword over to the civilian population and ultimately he became president and when he became president he was accused continually of wanting to be king it was just constant and like that that was the the level yeah oh my god it's like you know we've fought this whole revolution now George Washington's gonna be king the one guy the one guy on earth who didn't want to be king when he could have been king and he was constantly accused of it and that's one of the reasons why I try to keep the rhetoric down you know I try to keep the rhetoric about tyranny down I try to keep the rhetoric about the end of the country down because it's been the end of the country since the country began and so not not always that word the think you know I didn't have good novels this year one of the things about this year was you know normally I'm writing a novel and this because of my memoir came out and because I was starting this show and trying to get this show up and running I I was actually reading a lot of policy stuff a lot of wonky stuff to bring myself so I could be informed and all this stuff I'd read usually I'm steeped in like classic novels and I didn't read any the one novel that I just actually loved was the girl on the train the thriller by Paula Hawkins the movie was I didn't like the movie I thought the movie was like really muddy and didn't have any emotions in it just have we got him yeah okay I didn't have anyone you know that that was one of the things that was really interesting this is part of one of these thrillers one of these new girl thrillers you know gone girl and a couple of there have been a couple of them girls with lose their memory it's basically it's really interesting I came up as a thriller writer in the 90s and I was part of the invention of what they were calling the Yuppie thriller which was ordinary is kind of neo Hitchcock II and stuff ordinary people getting into these incredible moments of danger and now the there they are doing those again but they're doing them with women and so gone girl is one of them and girl on the train was another one so the culture this year not not great but really interesting and there was an article in Hollywood Reporter you know this is what we've been fighting for and a lot of times conservatives don't understand the culture and they think it's all propaganda it's just a way of you know transmitting their messages and that's not true but when you silence every conservative voice when you blacklist every conservative voice the culture does begin to erode the values that we care about and it does begin to like slow dripping on sand begin to cut from under your feet the values that you hold dear and that's why a guy like Barack Obama who has absolutely no experience no skill but but looks like looks like what we've been told the great black American president was gonna look like that is why he gets elected because they control the culture there was an article in Hollywood Reporter last week I think that pointed out in you know Hollywood Reporter's a trade magazine so there they know that all the people in town that pointed out that the election of Trump was such a shock to the system of the elites that people have start in Hollywood have started to question themselves I'll believe it when I see it but the interviews went like this you know we have a character who's a conservative in this TV show but maybe we should make him less of a cartoon you know they had actual stories of actual producers calling actual writers and saying take this this conservative character and make him more real because they felt that they had ignored the audience who was represented by Donald Trump now if that's true if that is true then Trump will have done an amazing thing I mean if I if I had two big dreams for the Donald Trump presidency here's what they would be one would be that that the elites start to realize that they have it good because of decadence and maybe that's not so good for the rest of the country and if the elites start to realize that and start to you know do what Hollywood used to do because Hollywood was always filled with elites and weirdos and eccentrics and artists and people who didn't share the life of the people but because it was run by mostly Jewish businessmen who loved the country they would say let's serve the country let's show the people what they want let's show them themselves at their best let's show them their priests as heroes let's show them their institutions as sound let's show them their their values as heroic and let's do that and that not only sold America to America it's sold America to the world that was the greatest single cultural invention the movie business has been the greatest single cultural invention of America and to have that come back a little bit to have those people these elites these guys in their bubble who are what John Nolte calls bubble bum to have that bubble burst by the election of Donald Trump and having them start to think like hey you know maybe we should call in a guy who thinks that Jesus is not a bad guy you know who thinks that you know that Christianity is not a bad thing that would be an amazing thing and the other thing would be this if Trump is successful enough to reduce the mainstream media to the pure irrelevance which they deserve that that's only part one and the other part is that that a new news media is created that is dedicated to telling the truth for everybody for telling both sides for telling the truth in incidents and telling both sides and balancing their staff you know guys I'm gonna have to cancel Christian I'm sorry I would have loved to have had him here those are my hopes and dreams for the future of the country I'm feeling pretty good about it let me leave off just with one quick talk about Christmas I get I get it every time I talk about religion somebody lambaste me you know every time and a lot of them think that when when two people over the last couple of days of left notes calling me a universalist meaning I think that all religions are the same they're not obviously listening to me I only think one religion is true although I do think that people can come closer to that religion sometimes when they're when they're not mouthing the words of that religion than they do otherwise you know what's that okay all right yeah I know I think we have to we have to wrap it up but you know for me in America anyway too often Christianity and Christ's arrival are just seen as a license for me to condemn your sex life or somehow a team that I'm on that is better than the other team or it's a blessing on conservatives and a curse on all liberals and those things are the concerns of men not of God you know obviously your individual moral life and our moral life as a people is a concern of God but you're judging other people's life not what really God is interested in not what this is about the birth of Christ the birth of Christ is good news because it means that God acted in history to open up a path from your heart to joy and not if anything if there is something that I wanted to communicate in this show it is that that God has done a specific thing at a specific time to open up a path between your heart and joy and the thing is it's when I say your heart I don't mean your the heart you pretend to have the heart you show to other people or the heart even you only pretend to have to yourself or the heart that other people are showing on Facebook or the heart that other Christians are telling you that they have that so better than yours I'm talking about your heart with all its anger and its perversions and its craziness and it's a sin and it's envy and it's bitterness all those things the pathway from that heart to joy is opened and it is opened on the original Christmas day and it is opened now and forever that path obviously is like all good things it is an upward path through dark places but every step of the way I promise you is a step of joy and when I say joy what I mean is vitality in life what Christ called life in abundance it is open to you and that that is the real Christmas is that that path between your heart as it is right now as it is right now and believe me I know how black it is because mine is too from that heart to the joy of God is a real thing so don't be afraid don't be afraid don't let any Christians that loudmouth judgmental nasty Christians make you afraid to walk that path in fact don't be afraid at all do not be afraid do right fear nothing the Lord has plans for you not for evil but for good plans to give you a future and a hope and the Lord has come I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show have a Merry Merry Christmas and a very happy new year and we will be back in 2017 god only knows what it has in store but we will see you then let us leave with a Mormon Tabernacle Choir
