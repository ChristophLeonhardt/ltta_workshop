1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,040
JAPAN'S POPULATION CONTINUES
TO SHRINK AND PART OF THE

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,190
REASON WHY IS BECAUSE THE
BIRTH RATE IN THE COUNTRY IS

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,760
INCREDIBLY LOW AND THAT IS A
PROBLEM THAT WE HAD BROUGHT

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,340
UP AND TALKED ABOUT ON THE SHOW
QUITE A BIT.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,740
HOWEVER, IT IS HAVING A REAL
NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,400
ECONOMY IN JAPAN.

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,950
THE WORKFORCE NEEDS MORE WORKERS
AND EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,839
PROBLEM WITH THE POPULATION
SHRINKING, THERE'S ALSO THE

9
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:25,990
ISSUE OF FOREIGN WORKERS.

10
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,890
JAPAN DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF
FOREIGN WORKERS AND SO AS A

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,970
RESULT, OWNERS OF COMPANIES ARE
TRYING TO THINK OF CREATIVE

12
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,329
WAYS TO GET PEOPLE WHO DO NOT
TYPICALLY WORK BACK INTO

13
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:39,210
THE WORKFORCE AND THEIR FOCUSING
SPECIFICALLY ON HOUSEWIVES.

14
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,090
THERE ARE A LOT OF CONVENIENCE
STORE TRAINS OR FAST FOOD

15
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:47,109
RESTAURANTS THAT ARE NOW TRYING
TO ENGAGE WITH HOUSEWIVES

16
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:49,820
AND THEY ARE TRYING TO CONVINCE
THEM TO COME BACK INTO THE

17
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,289
WORKFORCE AND GO THROUGH SOME
TRAINING JUST SO THEY CAN

18
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:56,329
HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO RUN THEIR
COMPANIES.

19
00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:11,799
CAN I JUST SAY, THAT 
IS A

20
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,119
TERRIBLE SLOGAN.

21
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,590
MCDONALD'S: NO PROBLEM.

22
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,030
WHY, WAS THEIR PROBLEM?

23
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,200
THEY ARE TRANSLATING IT FROM
JAPANESE.

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,490
I AM SURE IT MEANS I KNOW IT'S A
PAIN IN THE ASS TO WORK, BUT

25
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:28,009
DON'T WORRY, WE WILL BE
FLEXIBLE, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M

26
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:29,009
SAYING?

27
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:31,710
MAYBE THAT IS A BETTER
TRANSLATION.

28
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,040
ONE EXECUTIVE AT MCDONALD'S
SAYS:

29
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:45,950
I'M GLAD THERE ARE NO
STEREOTYPES IN THERE.

30
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:51,509
IN JAPAN THE PAY GAP IS PRETTY
BAD THAT IT IS THE SECOND WAS

31
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,250
COUNTRY IN TERMS OF A GENDER
PAY GAP AMONG ECONOMICALLY

32
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,300
DEVELOPED COUNTRIES.

33
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,920
OBVIOUSLY YES.

34
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:05,580
BUT THAT PROBABLY SPEAKS TO WHY
THAT TYPE OF, IS OPENLY

35
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,179
MADE AND PEOPLE DO NOT CRITICIZE
IT.

36
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:09,470
NO QUESTION.

37
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,200
SOUTH KOREA BY THE WAY IS THE
WORST IN DISPARITY BUT TO BE

38
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,800
FAIR TO THE JAPANESE, THEIR
FEMALE PARTICIPATION RATE IN THE

39
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,360
ECONOMY IS HIGHER THAN OURS SO
MORE WOMEN WORK IN JAPAN

40
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,530
THAN THEY DO IN THE UNITED
STATES.

41
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,000
THAT'S KIND OF BANANAS.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,470
ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE
PERCENTAGE OF HOUSEWIVES IN

43
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,330
THE WORKFORCE IN JAPAN IS ABOUT
20%.

44
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,610
THE PERCENTAGE OF JAPANESE
WOMEN IN THE WORK FIRST

45
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,950
EXPERIENCED A SHARP DROP ONCE
WOMEN IN INNER THEIR 30S

46
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:46,810
FROM 80% AGE 29 TO JUST OVER 71%
FROM THE AGES TO 38 TO 39.

47
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,490
AS THEY GET OLDER AND THEY HAVE
KIDS THEY ARE LESS LIKELY

48
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,790
TO BE IN THE WORKFORCE HOWEVER,
THE LEADER OF JAPAN IS

49
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,040
TRYING TO CHANGE THAT BY MAKING
CHILDCARE MORE AVAILABLE,

50
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,920
BY ENCOURAGING WOMEN TO GO OUT
THERE COME INTO THE WORK FIRST

51
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,090
AFTER THEY'VE KIDS AND AGAIN,
JAPAN'S FEMALE LABOR MARKET

52
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,090
PARTICIPATION RATE HAS SURPASSED
THAT OF THE UNITED STATES

53
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,260
AND IS NO LONGER LOW COMPARED TO
OTHER ADVANCED COUNTRIES.

54
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:14,830
AND FINALLY TO STAND GIVING
THEM CREDIT, IT IS SHINZ?

55
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,830
ABEÃ­S

56
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,480
PLAN AT WORK THERE, IT
BROUGHT MORE WOMEN INTO THE

57
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,770
WORKFORCE WITH A VERY SIMPLE
IDEA.

58
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,820
THEY HAVE KIDS, ESPECIALLY THE
OLDER WOMEN WHO THEN WANT

59
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,040
TO GET INTO THE WORKFORCE AFTER
INITIALLY HAVING KIDS YOU

60
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,050
HAVE TO GIVE THEM CHILD
SERVICES.

61
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,480
ONCE YOU DO THAT IT TURNS OUT
THEY WANT TO WORK BUT HERE

62
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,320
IN AMERICA WE ARE LIKE NO, YOU
CAN BARELY TAKE ANY TIME

63
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,760
OFF AND IT MIGHT NOT BE PAID AT
ALL OF YOU HAVE KIDS.

64
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,400
IN THE BEGINNING AND THEN LATER,
CHILDCARE.

65
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,330
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU
CHILDCARE.

66
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,330
HERE ARE SOME BOOTSTRAPS.

67
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,271
IT TURNS OUT IF YOU DO
CHILDCARE, MORE WOMEN WILL

68
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,710
WORK DIANE MAKES SENSE.

69
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:55,940
LOOK, ABE SAW THAT AS AN
ECONOMIC SOLUTION WAS HERE

70
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:00,260
IN THE UNITED STATES IT IS NOT
SEEN AS THAT.

71
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,260
IT ABSOLUTELY IS.

72
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,410
IF YOU WANT
MORE WOMEN TO GO OUT THERE

73
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,861
AND NOT FEEL BURDENED BY THE
COST OF CHILDCARE, YOU WANT

74
00:04:07,861 --> 00:04:10,920
THEM TO BE PART OF THE ECONOMY,
TO BE PRODUCTIVE.

75
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,850
BY THE WAY, PEOPLE WHO STAY HOME
AND TAKE CARE OF THEIR KIDS

76
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,770
ARE ALSO PRODUCTIVE BUT I MEAN
SPECIFICALLY ECONOMICALLY

77
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,488
PRODUCTIVE.

78
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:18,768
IF YOU WANTED TO HAPPEN, YOU
NEED TO MAKE IT A LITTLE

79
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:19,769
EASIER ON THEM.

80
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:22,699
WE DON'T HAVE MANDATORY
MATERNITY OR PATERNITY LEAVE

81
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:27,980
AND WE ALSO CAN'T AFFORD, MOST
OF US CAN'T AFFORD HOW EXPENSIVE

82
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,900
CHILDCARE IS RIGHT NOW THOUGHT
IT IS SO CRAZY EXPENSIVE.

83
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,240
HOW DO PEOPLE DO IT?

84
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,520
IF YOU HAVE KIDS, WHAT DO YOU
DO?

85
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,580
IN THE BIG CITIES IS INSANE
AND IF YOU DON'T LIVE BY

86
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,500
YOUR PARENTS AND FAMILY, YOU
ARE TOTALLY SCREWED AND THE

87
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,439
GOVERNMENT IS NOT GOING TO HELP
YOU.

88
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,439
NOBODY IS.

89
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,439
GEE, I WONDER WHY THE YOUNGER
ADMINISTRATION THINKS THE

90
00:04:48,439 --> 00:00:00,000
MIXED ECONOMY IS NOT ABOUT IDEA.
