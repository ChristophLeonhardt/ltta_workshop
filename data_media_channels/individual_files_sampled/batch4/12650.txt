a new Gallup poll shows that American workers are more optimistic about the job market than at any time ever recorded yet the New York Times a former newspaper says we should quote stop giving Donald Trump the benefit of the doubt that's right on The Times op-ed page also known as knucklehead ro knucklehead Michelle Goldberg says everything Trump is done is going wrong Goldberg quotes a left-wing opinion piece as evidence that wages have not increased since the Trump tax cut despite the fact that the first three months of this year saw private sector workers receive the biggest wage hikes in 11 years and with jobs and abundance there's likely more to come goldberg makes fun of the ups and downs of negotiating with a noxious loony-tune like Kim jong-un despite the fact Trump's already gotten Kim to release three American hostages Goldberg says quote it's one thing to humor our idiot president but con men should never be given the benefit of the doubt thanks very much Michelle here

have two choices either you say oops made a mistake so sorry now I'm gonna change I was wrong or you double down on your mistake and you start to rationalize it well I did it because of this and I did it because of that and that's the way the road to perdition devil loves that the devil loves that it's the difference between saying going to God and saying I sinned I'm sorry I'm the dope let me off the hook and say no it was great it was fine it was written you know you know what all of morality can be rewritten so that I I can feel that I was doing the right thing and I don't have to feel ashame this Russian investigation thing I know you know it's so complicated and I don't want to go into it and out of it and all this stuff in the steel dossier and who is who is Carter page you know but what were they talking about it's so complicated let's just boil it down to the most basic thing okay the most be just common sense and if you unless you have the most extraordinary circumstances imaginable an administration should not be using the intelligence services to spy on an opposing campaign I mean that is basic right you know people the the left is saying oh well the Hillary Clinton thing was worse because it was all out in the open that was a criminal investigation based on evidence of a criminal a crime there was plenty of evidence of a crime and so they started a criminal investigation with the Trump campaign this was a counterintelligence investigation which you're not allowed to talk about by law so it had to be secret by law and all the same they were they were leaking information about it they started the counterintelligence investigation hoping to find criminal activity totally different thing you do not do that to an opposing campaign unless you have evidence that they are sneakin around behind the scenes undercover you know going around telling meeting Russians and trying to arrange to skew the election nothing was extraordinary about the Russians you know trying to skew the election they always do it we do it to them they're there tapping into email they're stealing emails was a reason to start an investigation against the Russians but not about Trump so now Donald Trump and justice come together they come to an agreement that the Inspector General is gonna look into whether this was a political act whether that the Obama administration misbehaved and the left is going nuts they are doubling down against common sense I mean this is basic common sense look this is a constant dose right it's like constitutional crisis the Justice Department is part of the executive branch it is answerable to the president he has every right to make sure that this incredible investigation which is now going on for more than a year a year and a half without any evidence coming to light he has every right to ask whether this was you know just remember this I mean again not to get into the deep the weeds about this James Comey James clapper the Director of National Intelligence said to James Comey of the FBI go in and tell Donald Trump about this this dossier that says you were with prostitutes in Russia Comey goes in and does that within an hour and we now know that the FBI knew about this the FBI was talking to CNN within an hour CNN is saying oh yeah we're gonna do a story about this because now we have a news hook because James Comey took it in to the president so clapper was the guy he was the connection when they asked clapper if he had ever leaked any information to CNN this is cut number one general clapper have you ever leaked information classified or unclassified to a member of the press not wittingly or knowingly as I said in my statement classified or unclassified well unclassified is not there's not leaking but unclassified that's have you ever given information to a reporter that you didn't want you to have your name connected with but you wanted to see it in the paper I have not there's a new newly declassified house intelligence report says this quote clapper subsequently acknowledged discussing the dossier with CNN journalist Jake Tapper and admitted that he might have spoken with other journalists about the same topic clappers discussion with tapper took place in early January 2017 a the time intelligence community leaders bright brief President Obama and President Trump on the Christopher steel information so in other words it was a setup it was a setup this is you know again common sense if this guy is lying and remember he lied about the NSA as well he went on and they asked him about the and we even have that cut just play the the second cut of him line in 2013 cut number eight so what I wanted to see is if you could give me a yes or no answer to the question does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans no sir it does not not wittingly there are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect but not not wittingly that was perjury that was under oath and he never met you know these guys never pay the price they never pay the price people are always asking me is hillary clinton gonna go to jail no nobody pay the price for this but we can make them pay the price we can hold them accountable this guy lies and lies and lies so now we know that there was an informant you know what do you want to call him you want to call him a spy or you want to call him an informant you want to call him a guy who just said how'd he do and then stole information and give it back to the intelligence services now we know this was in the Trump campaign here's James clapper all right he's still on TV right lied in front of them with Congress but now he's a commentator on TV so he was setting up with CNN even before this happens and he doubles down basic common sense this is a violation of at least our principles unless it comes out that Donald Trump in a trench coat and a little hat was missing meeting Boris badenov in a dark alley common sense tells you this is a violation of our basic principles for free and unfettered elections right but James clapper this guy who lied to Congress is now on CNN and he says oh no spine that was a good thing it's a good thing let's hear it well I think it's this is hyperbole hyperbole they may had someone who was talking to them in in the campaign but you know the focus here and as it was with the intelligence community is not on the campaign per se but what the Russians were doing to try to to instantiate themselves in the campaign or to influence or leverage it so if there was someone that was observing that sort of thing well that's a good thing because the Russians pose a threat to the very basis of our political system and I think it's hugely dangerous if someone like that is exposed because the danger to that person not to mention the reluctance of others to sir to be informants for the FBI and the FBI gains a lot of valuable information from informants so to me this is incredible common sense common sense your friend somebody you think is your friend lies she once lies to you twice comes on a third time and says diffuse garbage oh it was a good thing we're spying on an oppositional campaign it's a good thing why is anybody still why is even in front of a microphone why is he there I don't get it I don't get it it's violates common sense but they double down on it stamps.com you know it's sometimes kids when I wrote young adult novels for kids and the kids really liked them and sometimes I get these letters from them and they

stamps.com and enter Clavin in you'll never have to drive down to the post office again doubling down on common sense so Mike Pompeo comes out and he says we're going back into negotiations with Iran right we did the Iran deal now we're going back into negotiations and what does he want and he goes before the Heritage Foundation's his first major speech as Secretary of State and he tells them what we want here he is you know that list is pretty long but if you take a look at it these are 12 very basic requirements the length of the list is simply a scope of the maligned behavior of Iran we didn't create the list they did from my conversation with European friends I know that they broadly share these same views of what the Iranian regime must do to gain acceptance in the international community we acknowledge Iran's right to defend its people but not its actions which jeopardize world citizens also in contrast to the previous administration we want to include Congress as a partner in this process we want our efforts to have broad support with the American people and injure beyond the Trump administration a treaty would be our preferred way to go we understand that are we in position of sanctions and the coming pressure campaign on the Iranian regime will pose financial and economic difficulties for a number of our friends indeed it imposes economic challenges to America as well these are markets our businesses would love to sell into as well and we want to hear their concerns but you know we will hold those during prohibited business in Iran to account unlike the previous administration we're looking for outcomes that benefit the Iranian people not just the regime let me unpack this for a minute I mean a lot of the commentators yesterday we're out there saying oh ask for the moon why don't you you know you wanted to give up their nuclear weapons and stop funding terrorists this is Iran you're talking about it's a negotiation right of course she asked for them and what he said is absolutely right it's Iran that sets the standards by violating all the norms of civilized behavior but he's also talking to the Europeans because the Europeans are really ticked off about this they're really they feel the Trump is a wild man that they can't trust him and he pulled out a bait they trusted him Obama when he said we're opening your markets to Iran again the big export markets for them and and all we have to do is sign onto the steel and they thought this was the deal he was they were making with America again not common sense right not common sense because we have a system for making deals with our country it's called making a treaty that's what Pompey was saying here we passed a treaty you're making a deal with Obama as far as we're concerned he's just a guy he's just a guy he may be the president guy but he's still just a guy that's not us right this is important they're saying oh well Iran will never do this but Iran is in trouble there was a really good piece in The Wall Street Journal saying Iran has to get ready for the battle real reales they're their monetary they're coin this is from mark doober Whitsun richard goldberg of the foundation for the defense of democracies just one quick paragraph it says Iran's economy is in crisis inflation the skyrocketing banks are in turmoil and Iranians protest daily against the regime's ineptitude corruption and foreign adventurism the currency is collapsing in 1979 just before the Islamic Revolution Iran's official exchange rate was 70 rail to the dollar today's official read rate is 42,000 to 1 it's only available to those with regime connections most Iranians have to accept less favorable terms on the black market so and now in other words this is this is turning up the pressure when the pressure will do something it will create a problem for Iran common sense again and he says to them you know we get into this that these are markets you want to be in their markets we want to be in as well we want to be in these markets and make money too but this has to be done Iran cannot be allowed to dominate the region because we use the region the Gulf for shipping and for passage and for defending you know our interests and that Europe depends on us being the big dog and protecting their interests as well so Europe is not you know as is looking at a short term interest Trump is right and they're wrong and they just can't stand it because he's not one of them and because he is this wild man and he talks the way he talked so they're ready to double down and violate common sense the way they did when they signed this deal in the first place the last example I want to give of this because you know there's a horse called justify that may win the Triple Crown this is the Triple Crown for the left justify itself this is the triple ground for the left justifying it so I've talked I can't get off of this subject of Donald Trump berating ms-13 as a bunch of animals and the left running to their to their defense the former head of Planned Parenthood and saying you can't call people animals they're just clumps of cells he didn't say that that's guess was the rest of the sentence right you can't call them animals it just comes themselves we wouldn't kill animals the way we kill babies come on but you know this this quote obviously was just taken out of context by every single member of the media Democrat complex every single one of them took it out of context on Twitter and made it sound like he was calling all illegal immigrants animals and he was just referring to ms-13 okay made a mistake what do you do sorry sorry God sorry people we did the wrong thing that's not what we do we report the news they're defending taking it out of context the defending they're defending the bad behavior this is it's just common sense if you're a reporter report the news not on CNN it's not listen to this Don is it appropriate for a president to ever call anyone an animal even if they are sadistic gang members yeah I think that's something to watch out for the history of political leaders dehumanizing opponents even criminals and using animal metaphors is a dangerous one that is not something that we should accept from an American president yes content comments should be reported in context but I think it's pretty is also saying what look at the real stats don't just flick the style look at the substance beware of bullies playing the victim card don't fall for that it's our job to impose context but it's also in the context of his actions and rhetoric around immigrants over time just keep in mind this was an old game at the White House place Trump says something that's incredibly offensive and then he comes out and says it's fake news it was taken out of context it was just a joke or something so he gets to slam the news media as well as getting his offensive comments out there to his face don't fall for it it isn't quick and remember the final point I would make is whatever the so-called context that was animals remark what people heard was very different it's that he is stigmatizing and dehumanizing immigrants I wonder why people heard that oh yeah because you misreported it common sense the investigation of Trump Bears looking at this is something that should be only done in the most extraordinary circumstances and they didn't exist at bears looking at common sense Iran needs to be face down and negotiated with hard in a hard-boiled way common sense and the press should report accurately common sense the Left says no so speaking of common sense I just have to deal with this thing Jordan Peterson Jordan Peterson is now under full assault you all know Jordan Peterson the Canadian professor who stood up against this demand that he called women men and men women and all the stuff and he's since become this huge deal and he's written this book the rules you know rules for living what is 12 rules for life yeah 12 rules for life is a huge a best-seller and the left is going insane that New York Times ran a piece about him where what they did you know George thinks in you me an archetype so he talks about the meaning symbols of things and he talks about him men in a lot of literature represent order and women represent chaos in primitive things so the New York Times runs a piece and says in mr. Peterson's world order is masculine chaos is feminine and if an overdose of femininity is our new poison mr. Peterson knows the cure he said you know I mean just a hit piece it's a hit piece by taking him out of contact and taking him taking it personally David French has a good piece about this in National Review where French says they're doing this because he's addressing people in the left's terms he said you know French says if he wanted somebody to tell men to man up and to be responsible and to work hard and focus and create order any religious person any Christian person will tell you to do that but he's not speaking in Christian terms he's freaking in intellectual terms he's co-opted their language so I just want you to listen when you talk about common sense or any kind of sense any logic listen to this debate Jordan Peterson and the actor Stephen Fry very very intelligent man Stephen Fry debated Michael Dyson they he's a professor GW I believe in Washington and a cop and that columnist Michelle Goldberg who wrote that hilariously stupid piece in the New York Times they so they're in Toronto and they're debating political correctness and they start accusing petersen of white privilege so listen to the way peterson talks and the fact that the michael dicen won't let him talk which is interesting as well but listen to what he says he makes a reasoned argument about white privilege from my white privilege okay so let's assume now that's yeah well that's what you would say so so let's say here let's get precisely okay was that in the very individual of you let's get precise about this okay good possession what degree is my private present level of attainment or achievement a consequence of my white privilege and I don't mean sort've I mean do you mean five percent do you mean fifteen percent do you mean twenty five percent do you mean seventy five percent and what do you propose I do about it how about a tax how about a tax that's like specialized for me so that I can account for my damn privilege you so yeah so I can stop hearing all right completely reasoned argument what do you expect to do about it if there is white privilege so what I mean you know my my grandfather came over here there was a lot of Christian privilege Irish came over here there was a lot of Protestant privilege so what you know what are you gonna do about it listen to the way Dyson responds to this personally wouldn't let him talk he's making those kind of deep growling noises now his reasoned response terminologically your beginning at a point this already productive and controversial you're saying how can he get his equality back who are you talking about Jordan Peterson trending number one on Twitter Jordan Peterson internationals in an international bestseller I want him to tweet something out about me in my book Jordan Peterson right this is what I'm saying to you why the rage bruh you're doing well but you're a mean man right man mean mad white man is kind of using black privilege right because what if Jordan Peterson had said to him you're a mean mad black man he wouldn't have gotten away with it because Dyson has black privilege all I'm saying there though is like listen to the way one side is using reason and argue and the other is just slinging insults I mean they it's not just a bending common-sense its abandoning reason altogether we have got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube but you don't want to miss James O'Keefe and

O'Keefe who I love Voki BEC O'Keefe is out of his mind he's just a crazy lunatic Project Veritas we're gonna play the clips that he had before we go to this interview because I just want you to see that probably obviously Project Veritas is the thing that goes out and they go out and they do undercover reporting that the left won't do in the left is most of the media so that means almost no one will do it and no one will play it after he does it because they're afraid as he talks about they're afraid of getting sued now he's going after teachers unions and he caught a bunch of them just saying oh yeah if there's a sexual incident or some kind of violent we'll cover it up we will cover it up here's just a few clips from that investigation we're not going to turn around as soon as they leave and call HR a Joe Smith was just in here well they don't do that so Mikey's my brother's case have no one heard it and no one saw it and the kid didn't report it in my 8 years in this position I've never had somebody terminated for a situation like this so this is not me I mean I've had teachers physically in physical altercations it's sexual altercations with kids verbal altercations with kids violating the professional standards rules in other ways that don't involve kids and it's you know that it's really rough stuff and one guy is actually resigned James O'Keefe from Project Veritas will tell you all about it in this interview all right James O'Keefe it's good to see you thanks for coming on great to be with you Andrew so project very taut you you're making trouble again James I'd leave you alone for 10 minutes and you're always bothering these nice people like the teachers unions before we talk about that I just want to tell you because in California now they are playing these ads that the team obviously backed by the teachers unions about how evil corporations are trying to start charter schools and destroy public education of education which in California is so bad that it's almost like just sitting still so you've been exploring some of the teachers unions around the country give us an idea what you find it well Andrew we first hear the story we did in New Jersey two presidents were fired Rezac resigned suspended David Perry and Kathleen Valencia in New Jersey were caught on tape saying unbelievably fraudulent things about children they said that they were turning the child abuse back onto the child that Perry said was bending the truth Valencia said she was protecting this is the president of the teachers union in Jersey she was protecting a teacher had sex with a teenage girl student who and she was talking about kids are scumbags everything like if Andrew Clavin had written a caricature of what a Union mob boss would look like in New Jersey this is what these guys were doing on tape so so there when you say they were protecting them they were like hiding the reports and things oh that with what Perry was meeting with an undercover person who said that he had that the undercover had a friend who had abused a student and Perry said well that's what we do here I protect the worst teachers Perry says that I protected teachers who shoplifted drug abusing teachers we turned the abuse back on reverse it onto the kid is what he said Wow and it was so outrageous Andrew and I no they were on this podcast but I encourage the viewers to watch these tapes if they have not seen them that the the Governor of New Jersey who is a Democrat guy named Murphy no longer chris Christie has now defended Project Veritas and called for legislative hearings into the teachers union in New Jersey we've released more tapes in Michigan showing them saying that mandatory child reporting mandatory reporting was a choice we've released two tapes in New Jersey I'm sorry Michigan the other one in Michigan showed a payoff against someone accused of molesting a child so we have more tapes coming out there's more to say but that's where we have thus far that this is it really is amazing I mean this is these guys form a substantial portion of the Democrat Party and Democrat Party support unions and general teachers unions specifically and they really have gotten completely out of control they are not serving the children and I I'm glad I'm glad to hear a Democrat is actually standing up to him and you do have the feeling I mean you're you've got three states do you have the feeling that this is pretty typical of the rest of the country well if you're mathematician just do a basic confidence interval I mean if we went to point zero one percent of the offices and we've caught in six bad-apple isolated incidents as they like to say and that's there that there but they fired the two presidents of the teachers union in New Jersey these are not low-level people and I would say that you know Andrew that as Lord Acton said that power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely and when you are considered a good organization that helps people and loves children and you can't question these folks and you can't hold them accountable I don't think they've ever been asked a difficult question in their lives they've never been challenged because they support children but above the the the head of the president of the New Jersey teachers union guy named David Perry was a banner that said we support the children and as the banner is next to his head like in the Acorn video Perry says we reverse the child abuse back on to the child so it's become a it's become so bad that now basic journalism basic question and answering undercover yields the truth which is that they only care about protecting their members and they'll do anything and in these situations so I think that this is a systemic problem and it requires releasing tapes little by little like we're doing and I think it'll yield reform so how much flack do you get for this I mean how did they just lay down and and say okay you got us shockingly and this is the interesting thing Mattia you know I subscribe to the Andrew Breitbart hypotheses which is the media is everything and then the unions know that so the unions play here is to say well O'Keefe's discredited and no one will but it made the front page of every newspaper in New Jersey it made the front page of The Star Ledger above the fold it didn't make one cable news show the videos the video is unbelievable if you watch this tape you got to watch the tapes in New Jersey Perry saying we reverse the child abuse back onto the child we Bend the truth is what Perry says he says we quote we bend the truth so no if there was any justice Fox would be playing the CNN we be playing this none of them are gonna play it so the unions play here is to not allow or to not get any of the local media to play the tapes but there was a whistleblower in Delaware yes on Friday which published an internal memo inside the Delaware Education Association that's the Delaware Teachers Union and that internal memo showed that the National Education Association Andrew had hired consultants and PR firms to try to limit the damage and internally they're very worried about these videos but they say that we cannot get caught by Project Veritas we have to try not to get caught and the whistleblower was saying this is a teacher and the Delaware Education Association was saying why are they so concerned about not getting caught these people are doing disgusting and unconscionable things we should reform our behavior so it really is getting people thinking Andrew about the issues inherent in what's going on so why won't Fox play this stuff this is good stuff I mean this is good material why won't the any of the networks I think because of the flack that they will get well that's a very that's a very sophisticated question but I wrote a whole book about it's called America yeah well I'm gonna talk to you about that but the the 30-second version the soundbite I guess is that undercover journalism is very risky Andrew it's it's very tough there's liability inherent there's I'm a lightning rod and when they cover it they get flak from people for airing the video in fact in New Jersey Fox 5 New York which did talk about the video they wouldn't air the video but they would quote the state Senate President talking about the video huh but they wouldn't actually show the film because we get sued a lot so the problem with undercover journalism is that it a lot of these networks don't want to actually put the videos on the air whether it's David daleiden with the Planned Parenthood tapes or me with these new tapes they don't want to actually get blood on their hands so to speak be the proximate cause in a liability lawsuit for having shown the tape so we have to actually get the people to resign before they can even talk about it which is what's happened that the David Perry was fired from the from the teachers union and then the governor issued a statement and then the New Jersey Star Ledger said well credit to project Veritas Wow Wow that's so what do they what do they sue you for when you have the tape of a guy saying oh yeah we turned the child abuse back on the child well then consumed us yet in this case we assume they will but they could sue you for tortious interference they could sue you for intentional infliction of emotional distress Boresha protects you this is all frivolous nonsense breach of reach of fiduciary duty trespass unlawful interception of oral communication although New Jersey the one-party consent state they can make stuff up and and but unfortunately and there's there's a lot of reasons for this we live in a country where there's a lot of lawyers and people are afraid and we're that's why we're the only people Andrew in the United States doing this there are people that don't go undercover to animal abuses what it really comes down to and the final analysis is not the litigation or or or media you know bias it really comes down to that we exposed the sacred cows the organizations like the Teachers Union which claim to be altruistic and there are a lot of political ramifications here when you show the heart and soul of this organization so that's really what it comes down to you know the teachers unions have this tremendous advantage that they are staffed with these guys who as you say are out of some kind of a parody of a gangster movie but of course many many teachers are wonderful and we depend on them and we love them and Miss Smith who's teaching your little boy is a great person and so they get to hide behind those teachers to do this stuff that they do they trot them out whenever they want to protect themselves you know you talk about these guys suing you for this stuff which does sound incredibly ridiculous that's the things they're suing you for is there a danger of their winning or is it simply the cost of defending yourself that makes it so difficult well I would say it's both I don't think they're going to win this this one lost it with Bob Kramer who is if you recall the incitement of violence at Trump rallies I mean we talked about Mueller you know everyday Mueller this Mueller that Russian interference we have on tape Andrew on videotape your audience will remember this people on hidden cameras saying we take money from Hillary run it through the DNC into democracy partners which incites violence at Trump rallies and there's no investigation the media doesn't care they were all fired and now Bob Kramer is suing me I think it's I think the problem is that people on the right Andrew we've talked about this when I buy on your program people on the right are more timid because the left is monolithic and it's control of the culture of the media the Academy and the courts therefore there's a sort of lack of moral courage on the right because there's just so many forces aligned against you in the pop culture that there's just a lack of a willingness to fight and go on offense it's you're in a sort of defense posture yeah in perpetuity and and then you have Project Veritas which you can't win a war with a shield you have to win it with a sword you have to you can't and we're all sort of sitting on our butts going what is the liberal media going to do to us today well well project Veritas is out there like slaying dragons I mean catching presidents of the teachers union on tape Bob creamers the best friends with Barack Obama he's on tape saying it was Hilary's idea to incite the violence and what did they do they sue me why well it's certainly not because it's justice because they want to they want to put a gag on me they want it they want to go O'Keefe's getting sued therefore out of good source information it's all a tactic yeah in the Olinsky and I like to let Michael it but it's in Alinsky playbook so that's what they're doing and you know it's to a certain extent effective I I really do believe that the right especially our politicians are like abused children they get hit so often that they're basically in a crouch looking over their shoulder all the time afraid to open their mouths and I think you're right we are on defense half at more than half the time so what about on social media now everybody's talking about like Twitter shadow banning people Google dropping conservative websites on their search list YouTube certainly has given us a lot of trouble you know with DES monetization and things like that do you do you see this a project Veritas well if you recall the story we uncovered in January where they're talking about shadow banning users and Abhinav pedrão was on he's a former Twitter engineer he was on tape saying that that's what we do and we've done it in the past I think it's a problem but I think andrew content is king if the story is good enough again it's the Bandra Breitbart in me if the story is good enough it will find a way to fester out into the hands of the people I mean again this teachers here and I know they're on a podcast year I encourage you to play the audio or your listeners to watch it it is unbelievably bad ya know what I've seen it a couple of it is it is it is it will it will shock your conscience so yeah you're right you know your your video about Twitter shadow banning it's not that you got a lot of credit for it but that became a meme something that people talked about after your video came out so the content does even though you don't get praise all the time would you deserve that at the same time is safe then the word does get out I'm not the mission here I mean there's a there's dozens of people with Project Veritas there is a there is a product that it's the journalism it's the investigative journalism and yes people became more aware of shadow banning but to your greater underlying question is how do you get the message out in a world that tries to shut it down and media won't play that media won't play the videos I keep CNN in my office people say why do you have seen em because that's the heart and pulse of pop culture that's that's what's in airports that's what people watch CNN but 600,000 people who do are the sort of it's the assignment desk for other news agencies and people in airports but know that the I think if the story is good enough it'll force people to pay attention and and the videos in New Jersey are even though they're not being played on and trending on Twitter legislators in these any stamp Democratic state legislators to say this is not good yeah this is really are they saying this is not good Andrew because parents are putting pressure on their local representatives so what you're actually seeing is a project Veritas at least is us bypassing the media and bypassing the culture and you're actually having parents in States yelling at they're yelling at their Democratic congressmen and state senators saying you better fix this problem because this looks bad yeah yeah and I think what we either do is just keep doing that and and until and again this is a true fact at the star-ledger which is the eighth largest newspaper in the United States puts this story above the fold and says two presidents fired governor investigating well hey I guess we need to just do more of that all right I'm out of time I wish we could talk more about your book American Pravda which I really enjoyed and I will bring you back to talk about it again you're doing great work James I really always love talking to you I hope you come back yeah and one action item everyone share those teachers union videos just share them on social media if you can good point good point thanks a lot Jay thank you I love this guy he's like it's just does nothing but get sued and attacked and he still has his hair it's not fair it's not right alright sexual follies so over pj media where I also write my colleague Tyler O'Neill has a wonderful story it is a story that will make your day okay it's the headline is transgender files $50,000 complaint after Muslim woman refuses to wax his genitals so earlier this month is Tyler O'Neill at bj media earlier this month a male to female transgender filed a fifty thousand dollar human rights complaint after a Muslim woman refused to perform a Brazilian wax on his genitals the unnamed transgender person has repeatedly claimed that he called inquiring about a leg wax but the owner of Mad Max the waxing studio based in Windsor Ontario Canada insisted the request clearly indicated his interest in general wax so essentially a transgender a guy who believes himself to be female is going to a head covered Muslim woman whose religion tells her that she must not touch a male right who is I'm sorry but via this is the world that they've created for themselves he's going to this this you know head covered you know Muslim woman who cannot buy her religious convictions touch a man and he's suing for fifty grand he's demanding fifty grand because she won't do it right so now this crazy politically correct Canada where they want to make it a law that you can't say her if the guy who says he's a girl and they can't you know you can't say him or whatever whatever it is cuz it's so confusing who knows what it is but also that has gone out of its way to protect the rights of Muslims and they put people on trial for offending Muslims now they've got the transgender guy saying that the Muslim girl won't wax him so he gets fifty thousand dollars I think you should go for a million bucks I think it should be a million dollars of that I think everybody but they should do is just put them all in a big mosh pit and they should rip each rights all right tomorrow is the mailbag get your questions in you gotta
