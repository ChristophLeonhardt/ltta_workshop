>> PEOPLE INFILTRATING OUR
CAMPAIGN NEVER IN THE
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY HAS
SOMETHING TAKEN PLACE LIKE
TOOK PLACE DURING THIS
ELECTION.
BRIAN: WOW.
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP ALLUDING
TO ALLEGATIONS THE FBI
PLACED AN INFORMANT, HE SAYS
SPY, IN HIS 2016
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN DURING
HIS RALLY LAST NIGHT.
THIS AS THE PRESIDENT WARNS
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT
MUELLER AND HIS TEAM ARE,
QUOTE:  MEDDLING IN THE MID
TERMS BY HOLDING THEIR PROBE
SO CLOSE TO THE ELECTIONS.
DOES HE HAVE A POINT?
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT'S
ONGOING, WE DON'T KNOW WHEN
IT'S GOING TO COME TO AN
END.
POLSTER FOR PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN ADAM
GELLER.
ADAM, SO HE TALKS ABOUT 13
ANGRY DEMOCRATS WHO WORK FOR
ROBERT MUELLER.
HE SELLS THEY ARE MEDDLING
IN THE MID TERMS BECAUSE THE
PROBE IS NOT WRAPPING UP.
AND WE ARE IN THE SUMMER
NOW.
>> HERE'S THE PROBLEM.
LET'S LOOK AT PRESIDENTS,
RIGHT?
YOU STARTED THIS
INVESTIGATION WITH TWO VERY
PARTISAN DEMOCRATS, RIGHT?
IN PAGE AND STRZOK AND
TALKING ABOUT DEPUTY
DIRECTOR MCCABE.
SO IT IS NOT REALLY
UNFATHOMABLE THAT YOU CAN
HAVE SOME PARTISAN DEMOCRATS
ON HERE WHO DO, IN FACT,
HAVE SOME SKIN IN THE GAME
AS FAR AS THE ELECTION IS
CONCERNED.
IT'S NOT OUT OF THE
QUESTION.
BRIAN: SO WE DON'T KNOW THAT
PARTISAN DEMOCRATS JUDGING
BY THEIR TWEETS THEY ARE
ANTI-TRUMP.
NOW WE KNOW THAT THE IG
REPORT IS GOING TO COME OUT
AND LOOK AT WHAT PETER
STRZOK AND LISA PAGE, WHO
ARE HAVING AN AFFAIR
ACTUALLY DOING.
THEY PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN
EVERYTHING IN THIS
INVESTIGATION.
NOW WE KNOW THIS LINKS BACK
TO LONDON.
NOT TO GET EVERYBODY
CONFUSED BUT THAT'S WHERE
PAPADOPOULOS IS AND THAT'S
WHERE HE MET WITH THE
INFORMANT AND THAT'S WHERE
HE MET WITH THE AUSTRALIAN
AMBASSADOR.
SO THIS IS COMING FULL
CIRCLE.
IF THE BIG PICTURE, WHAT DO
YOU THINK IT MEANS FOR THE
PRESIDENT?
IT USED TO BE BAD.
NOW I GET THE SENSE THAT
IT'S NOT ALL BAD FOR THE
PRESIDENT.
>> LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENING,
RIGHT?
THE PRESIDENT'S JOB APPROVAL
RATING IS GOING UP.
REAL CLEAR AVERAGE HAS IT
TODAY SOMETHING AROUND 47,
48%.
ABOUT AN 8 POINT JUMP FROM
JANUARY.
BRIAN: MUELLER'S IS GOING
DOWN.
>> MUELLER'S IS GOING DOWN.
INDEPENDENTS AND REPUBLICANS
ARE BOTH, YOU KNOW, THE
SUPPORT IS PLUMMETING FOR
THIS THING.
THEY ARE LOSING CREDIBILITY
BECAUSE ALL THIS LITTLE
PIECES OF INFORMATION KEEP
COMING OUT.
BRIAN: INTERESTING.
SOLE HERE IS TREY GOWDY
YESTERDAY SAYING WELL, ON
THIS INFORMANT, IT COULD
MEAN A COUPLE OF THINGS.
LISTEN.
>> IT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP
HIMSELF WHO SAID, NUMBER
ONE, I DIDN'T COLLUDE WITH
RUSSIA BUT IF ANYONE
CONNECTED WITH MY CAMPAIGN
DID, I WANT THE FBI TO FIND
THAT OUT.
I AM EVEN MORE CONVINCED
THAT THE FBI DID EXACTLY
WHAT MY FELLOW CITIZENS
WOULD WANT THEM TO DO WHEN
THEY GOT THE INFORMATION
THEY GOT.
AND THAT IT HAS NOTHING TO
DO WITH DONALD TRUMP.
BRIAN: BECAUSE THE PEOPLE
AROUND HIM WERE PERIPHERY.
HE NEVER EVEN MET CARTER
PAGE.
SO THAT'S THEIR PROBLEM, NOT
HIS.
>> I COMPLETELY AGREE.
AND SO AND THAT IS --
APPEARS TO BE EXACTLY WHAT'S
GOING ON.
THERE IS PERIPHERAL PLAYERS.
AND, QUITE FRANKLY, IN THE
GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS.
THE OBAMA JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT.
THE OBAMA FBI SENDING IN
SPIES.
NOT A GOOD LOOK FOR THE
DEMOCRATS.
BRIAN: DIDN'T HELP IN THE
LONG RUN.
IT HELPED BILL CLINTON LOOK
LIKE HE WAS BEING UNJUSTLY
