Donald Trump's fired up and can't wait to go after more people and obviously the number one target is Robert Muller the special counsel investigating him so recently he had a bunch of maniacal tweets as usual and then I will go to a Republican reaction and we'll see if they're ever going to hold him accountable he tweeted recently spent very little time with Andrew McCabe but he never took notes when he was with me I don't believe he made memos except to help his own agenda probably at a later date saying with lying James Comey can we call them fake memos he thinks that's clever which is always amuses me fake news is not clever and fake news is actually what got you into office your side used it fake memos is also not clever now McCabe was fired just a little over a day before he was set to retire and get his pension and a lot of people thought that that was malicious it is not malicious in terms of haha I'll show you it is actually done with a purpose the purpose is so it's not gratuitous I should say it is malicious with intent and the purpose is we cave might testify against Donald Trump with the extemporaneous notes that he took of their meetings if he backs up with James Comey said that could bolster the obstruction of justice charge against Donald Trump so he has such as firing him fire him and pretend that it's for lying under oath so that he could hurt his credibility when McCabe the Deputy Director for the FBI testifies against Trump so this is all the cover his ass it is to do damage control and is it and it is for the specific purpose of obstruction of justice anyone who can't see that is purposely blind you think that a day before he set to retire he's gonna leave anyway that all of a sudden that these guys were worried about lying such as lied under oath he about his contacts with the Russians and becames underlying issue was that he did a leak but it was a leak to make sure that the Clinton Foundation was investigated more not less so the Trump in administration is really angry at me came for investigating Hillary Clinton more who in their right mind could believe such nonsense so obviously a man not in his right mind is Trump and he keeps on tweeting he says why does the Muller team have 13 hardened Democrats some big crooked Hillary supporters and Cyril Republicans another damn recently added does anyone think this is fair yet there is no collusion the people that concluded there was no conclusion or Republicans in the house and including Devin Nunez who was part of the transition team for Donald Trump so his own team decided there was no collusion no investigator has ever concluded that and is it true that there's certain 13 hard Democrats and no Republicans on the special counsel team of course not remotely true in fact there was an analysis done by the press they're almost all Republicans including Muller who's a Republican Comey was a Republican the current head of the FBI a Republican McCain by the way by all indications even though his wife ran as a Democrat McCabe was a Republican as usual another outrageous preposterous lie by our president who appears to be a pathological liar and then he puts out this tweet a little bit later a total witch hunt with massive conflicts of interest with no context imagine if Obama had done that about the Benghazi hearings they would have said he lost his mind what kind of a maniac whose president the United States does a random weird tweet attacking everyone and everything he says though is wrong so all right now that isn't the question we already know what kind of a maniac Trump is the question is are the Republicans going to do anything about it if Trump actually goes one last step and fire smaller well his lawyer Dowd had suggested that he might do that he had to walk it back as it was not well-received but even trey Gowdy who was a Republican in the house now a little bit freer to speak his actual mind because he's not running for re-election so he's not tethered to the donors so he says if you have an innocent client mr. Dowd act like it and people who were innocent are not looking to fire the special counsel and so I'm glad that Dowd pointed that Goudy pointed that out and I've been pointing that out does anyone think that Trump is acting like an innocent person violently attacking anyone who may testify against him and firing them threatening to fire everyone who is currently investigating him he is every trapping of a massively guilty person in fact Gowdy continues and says that he hopes that Muller doesn't get fired because he's doing important work that's good to know then you go to Marco Rubio he was asked about he said I don't like the way that it happened referring to the McCabe firing he should have been allowed to finish through the weekend he went on to say he thinks that it's a bad idea to be quote smearing everybody within law enforcement agencies like the FBI that is definitely true gee I wonder why Donald Trump is smearing law enforcement you might want to smear law enforcement if law enforcement is investigating you and they're right okay then mono Raju from CNN caught up with Orrin Hatch and here's his tweet about that orrin hatch told me he does not support legislation to protect the special counsel but says this firing Muller would be quote the stupidest thing Trump could do we'll see if that's true because he might yet happen but it's good to see orrin hatch saying that on the record he went on to say quote my conversations with the White House have led me to believe legislation is not necessary at this point cuz I do not believe the president would take such a foolish action he apparently has never met the president of course he would take a foolish action like that because you guys will probably not follow through on your threat we'll get to that in a second because I want to ask you guys about that in a poll but why don't you just pass the legislation why don't you just pass a legislation saying you cannot fire the special counsel you could do it tomorrow but they won't John Cornyn also says it's not necessary but he says the consequences of firing Muller would be quote so overwhelming now I'm not sure that I believe him but it is good to see all these Republicans on the record saying do not fire Muller in fact let's go to Judge Napolitano now he's not sitting in Congress but he's a Fox News analyst and and the goofball is our president actually once considered him for the Supreme Court I'm glad he didn't go in that direction but I'm also glad to see that Napolitano is being principled here listen do you think the firing was vindictive and reckless I do how come because Andrew McCabe is more likely than not to be a witness against the Attorney General's boss the President of the United States I think that firing him in that environment could very well be interpreted as an effort to diminish his effectiveness as a witness what's that called obstruction of justice bingo that's exactly right man this issue is made for some really strange bedfellows Ralph Peters today quit Fox News huge war monger but he's saying look they're obviously covering up for Trump and weirdly maniacally incorrectly so and Napolitano is saying look it's obvious obstruction of justice on Fox News saying it now let's go to Lindsey Graham he's a Republican senator from South Carolina well as I said before if he tried to do that that would be the beginning of the end of his presidency because we're rule of law nation but when it comes to mr. Muller he is following the evidence where it takes him and I think it's very important he'd be allowed to do his job without interference and there are many Republicans who share my view so that those are strong words but then later he was asked yeah yeah but do you mean impeachment and he said yes impeachment would be an option an option if he were to fire Muller but that is apparently according to him for now what he said was the implication now let's go to charlie den he's another retiring congressman who's a Republican in the house and if he's relieved I'll tell you that would be the equivalent of a Saturday night massacre just like when Archibald Cox was fired during the during the Nixon days Lindsey Graham says it would be the end of the presidency do you think would be that great well I don't be the end of the presidency but boy but but set off a a just think it would be a catastrophic on many levels so politically it would just bring Washington to a standstill that's what would be the whole issue I mean we would be fighting over how do we let the investigation proceed any other business would not be able to get done so in many respects it would throw us into a complete and utter stalemate and let me and Lindsey Graham maybe right and maybe it doesn't the presidency look I'm hardened to here Republicans drawing a red line if you will on that issue and I think those are good strong comments by Charlie Denton he should get credit for it but how many retiring congressman are there how many principal Republicans are there in the country I mean if there were so principal why don't they just passed the law right now saying you can't fire the special counsel it's easy and a lot of times even Lindsey Graham saying well you shouldn't fire him without a cause well of course he's gonna pretend to have cause he's gonna say Oh conflicts of interest then he was working with McCabe and Co me and they were pro-hillary or maybe they were anti Hillary in the last preposterous firing it doesn't matter they're gonna invent an excuse and so they're not passing law by the way of course is usually with the corporate Democrats get a load of this reported by HuffPost the views of Senator Dianne Feinstein so-called Democrat of California I added the so called part lined up with those of the Republicans on Monday she told reporters that she didn't think special prosecutions protections were necessary says firing mauler was so obviously a bad move do you live on this planet senator Feinstein what when has an obviously bad move stop Donald Trump he said a million obviously bad moves I mean they keep thinking that he's an honest actor are you insane so when Feinstein was reminded that there's a progressive who's running a primary against her she then backpedal it whoa yeah I mean sure I guess so I guess so I forgot I was supposed to be pretending to hold the power accountable and pretending to do resistance but her initial instinct was yes of course we don't need to pass any laws protecting this special council why would Donald Trump ever do something that was a bad move okay side note vote for Allison whoreson against Dianne Feinstein she's not gonna be light resistance she's not gonna assume that Donald Trump has best intentions which is maniacal but now one last video for you guys this was Rick Tyler he's a Republican consultant he has a different take on what the Republicans will do watch this is gonna happen I'll go out on a limb do it the president has calculated now and and I think it's true to fill Rockers point is is the reaction from the Republicans he is going to fire robert muller whoo you heard it and what's you know what's gonna happen nothing that's what's gonna happen there'll be no response from the Republican leadership from from the Congress we got a single-line census from the Speaker of the House we got nothing for the leadership practically in the Senate we got a little bit from the Lindsey Graham but it's weak soup it's not going to happen he's going to get he's going to fire Mahler eventually probably sooner the rather than later before he can get any further on what you just mentioned money laundering or other other tangential issues ideas me oh wow wow wow it is not even 9:30 on a Monday morning and Rick Tyler just knocked my socks off was it ready for that make sure me it drives me crazy she's actually one of the best out there so every rule like she does some good interviews where she holds people accountable but you're really shocked by that I said I look at people in Washington I think when did they get detached for the rest of the planet Donald Trump will grieve really fire more of course he can fireball he just fired me game he fired called me and admitted on national TV that he fired because of the Russian investigation why would you be surprised with and the Republicans might not have principles and they might back him anyway oh of course of course so look it's a son open question and I am deeply curious to see what the Republicans are gonna do here and I want to ask you guys in a poll its tea white tea network.com slash accountability what will the Republicans do if Trump fires robert muller a nothing b vote for impeachment see hold of accountable by other means but i have to be honest with you i don't know what the other means would be so what are they gonna do you've been a naughty boy what are they gonna do put in a new special counsel that congress can't even do that and you need the justice department to do that it's his justice department so they've never clarified how they would hold them accountable if it is an impeachment do you really think that the republicans in mass are going to somehow have principles you might have a couple of outliers who go well i'm retiring anyway but remember that there's one the republicans they don't care about principles the fact that that's surprising to people on television or the people Washington is unreal to me right they're not honest actors the second part is what do Republicans do they follow orders of the donors the donors so far are thrilled with Donald Trump he just gave them trillions not billions trillions of dollars in tax cuts now if he does things that destabilize the market then you might have a different vote and that's real and that's possible but for the moment being the marching orders that the Republicans will get is shut up and get back in line if Trump fired him I'm sure he had a very good reason and hour and provid I mean Fox News will come on air and tell you oh yeah yeah yeah it was actually Muller who had no principles he had conflict of interest and he was some doing this and the lie and the leaks of the this and that and and they'll invent a thousand different lies about the special counsel and they'll move on with their lives how could that possibly be shocking right do I have it at above 50% definitely above 50% I'm not saying it's written in stone and it might again have to do with what Trump does in the meanwhile and which and how the donors feel about that but for people to be surprised about that is preposterous yes he can easily fire Moeller at any moment and yes the Republicans might not do a goddamn thing about it if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member TYT Network comm
