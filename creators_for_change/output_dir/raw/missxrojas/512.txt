well not being doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> exclusive and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">whatnot as you might imagine not really</font>

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,160
massively happy because<font color="#CCCCCC"> david cameron's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the new prime minister of my country and</font>

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,770
I do not like him one bit it's all right

<font color="#E5E5E5">you know the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> foxes BBC and poor people</font>

9
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:23,939
kind of annoyed that the liberal

10
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">democrats would make a deal with the</font>

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">Conservatives first he just seems</font>

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,810
fundamentally wrong just in<font color="#E5E5E5"> derry it</font>

13
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,460
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> just seems like a bit of a stabber</font>

14
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,170
back for the number of people who voted

15
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,870
lib dem so that they wouldn't get David

16
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,110
Cameron who changed their vote so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

17
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,030
it would be the strongest vote against

18
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,190
David Cameron but I'm hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font>

19
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,950
will mean there will be some good things

20
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the party for example having a live</font>

21
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:50,640
demo education secretary would be quite

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,489
good I think and an ideal world having

23
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,440
mr. cable instead of George Osborne as

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,449
Chancellor twould be very good anyway

25
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:03,210
that's all shop Talk as they call it in

26
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,040
America I'm also slightly crazy because

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,049
I have an exam my first exams in two

28
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:09,439
days my other exam is next week and I

29
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,869
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been making my maps and I have this</font>

30
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:14,159
dressing and I have been rereading

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,590
things 50 times for exams that you know

32
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,790
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your first you're technically they</font>

33
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,549
don't count was quite pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> Marxist</font>

34
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:23,369
theory and art<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jordan else is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty my</font>

darling<font color="#E5E5E5"> mug really little bit loony but</font>

36
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,939
I'm not kind of in the same situation

37
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:28,890
with stress as I was when I made that

38
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,229
very stressed video this time last year

39
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:33,180
I think was this time last year was a

40
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,009
levels because the last example I did

41
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,079
what intervals which were unfortunately

42
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,079
quite a big deal and<font color="#E5E5E5"> were supposed to be</font>

43
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,350
you know life defining and staff my mind

44
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,320
is still in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mindset and I just</font>

45
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,329
obsessed in work<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was obsessive work</font>

46
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:50,520
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not very healthy who</font>

47
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,740
else is<font color="#E5E5E5"> bringing in my life not that</font>

48
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,869
much to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be honest oh this year and other</font>

49
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:56,939
mention that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to make in this vlog</font>

50
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,549
because of course one has to apply by

51
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:02,969
promises they make in very early hours

52
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:04,230

particularly faithful to probably in my

favorite Club this video<font color="#CCCCCC"> rises entirely</font>

the Dutch edition of looking for alaska

00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,350
I've been so busy here but I will

Pilates I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it shows when I</font>

76
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,830
bring out in touch with my core and it's

77
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,080
very bizarre and this just as a complete

78
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,090
side note because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just forgot that I</font>

79
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,470
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about this it's really</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">weird cuz they do with this kind of</font>

00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,430
weird stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> than you or you know using</font>

82

<font color="#E5E5E5">different parts your body and trying to</font>

83
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,709
think as they go like anchored from your

84
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:21,330
core and stuff like that and it's all

85
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,650
very abstract and you think it hasn't

86
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,180
really done a thing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I left the bat</font>

87
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,650
very first<font color="#E5E5E5"> class that I did thinking</font>

88
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,720
what on earth is this I'm never<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

89
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,000
back I got the next morning and you can

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,950
feel that you actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> got something</font>

91
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,080
which is just craziness<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm matching</font>

92
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I was trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think as I was</font>

93
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,640
editing and as I have been past few

94
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,830
hours with the positives of having David

95
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,690
Cameron in Downing Street and also of a

96
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,730
Lib Dem<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tori coalition and our</font>

97
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,920
condemnation as some people have been

98
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,510
calling it on Twitter here is the only

99
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,640
thing I've come up with so far it may

100
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,900
just be because I'm in a bit of a

101
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,610
pessimistic mood<font color="#E5E5E5"> at both parties are</font>

102
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,920
against the third runway III which was

the one policy of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Labor that actually</font>

104
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,300
really going quite annoyed is quite a

105
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,220
local issue and it's just ridiculous

106
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,390
when we're actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to you know</font>

107

Greenpeace on you but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the truth I</font>

110
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,350
can't help it so I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to reconcile</font>

111
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,420
myself to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

112
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,820
nothing really<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can do get bored for</font>
