DONALD GLOVER
A.K.A.

2
00:00:07,779 --> 00:00:09,570
CHILDISH GAMBINO RELEASED

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,639
HIS NEW MUSIC VIDEO AND SONG
THIS WEEKEND THIS IS

4
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:16,450
AMERICA AND PEOPLE ARE VERY
EXCITED ABOUT IT.

5
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,330
THERE'S A LOT OF SYMBOLISM AND
COMMENTARY THAT WE ARE

6
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,609
GOING TO GET INTO NOW.

7
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:23,140
WE CAN'T SEE THE VIDEO BECAUSE
OF COPYRIGHT, BUT WE ARE

8
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,190
GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME
SCREENSHOTS AND GO INTO

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,360
SOME OF THE MOST PERTINENT AND
IMPORTANT SYMBOLISM THAT IS

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,690
PRESENT IN THE VIDEO.

11
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:31,980
THE FIRST IMAGE I WANT TO PULL
UP HERE, NOT THAT ONE.

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:32,980
MAYBE.

13
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,539
THE FIRST IMAGE IS OF HIM
SHOOTING THIS MAN HERE.

14
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:38,520
WHAT IS INTERESTING IS IN THE
BEGINNING HE STARTS DANCING

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,670
AND SMOTHERS DANCING IS VERY
EXAGGERATING.

16
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:45,730
SOME ARE SAYING THAT IT IS A
CHARACTER OF A CHARACTER.

17
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,951
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT
IT RESEMBLES JIM CROW AND YOU

18
00:00:48,951 --> 00:00:54,329
CAN SEE THAT IMAGE NOW, WHERE HE
IS BEING COMPARED IN THAT WAY.

19
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,460
YOU CAN SEE A LOT, EVEN THE
STANCES VERY SIMILAR THERE

20
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,820
AND SO HE IS IN THE STANDS WHILE
HE SHOOTS THIS MAN.

21
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,580
NOTHING HAPPENS, HE GIVES THE
GUN TO SOMEBODY.

22
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,189
THEY TAKE IT IN A RED CLOTH.

23
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:09,610
THEY ARE TREATING THE GUN VERY
NICELY AND THEN THE SORT

24
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,619
OF TRYING TO SHOW.

25
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:11,960
A LOT OF
PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT IS A

26
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,549
COMMENTARY ON GUN VIOLENCE IN
AMERICA, HOW WE REALLY PUT GUNS

27
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:20,159
ON A PEDESTAL BEFORE HUMAN LIFE
AND I THINK WE HAVE SEEN THAT

28
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,159
TIME AND TIME AGAIN AND THAT
IS REALLY, DONALD GLOVER'S

29
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,159
COMMENTARY ON THIS.

30
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:31,479
THIS IS A BRILLIANT VIDEO
AND AN EXCELLENT POLITICAL,

31
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:33,139
SOCIAL COMMENTARY ON AMERICA.

32
00:01:33,139 --> 00:01:38,719
IT IS NOT AN ACCIDENT THAT IT
IS CALLED THIS IS AMERICA,

33
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,639
FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO END THE
DEBATE AS TO IF HE MEANT IT.

34
00:01:42,639 --> 00:01:44,909
OF COURSE HE MEANT IT.

35
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:46,820
WHEN HE SHOOTS THE GUY AND
NOBODY CARES ABOUT THE GUY BUT

36
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,979
THEY CARE ABOUT THE GUN AND THEY
TREATED SO GENTLY, THAT IS

37
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:54,939
OBVIOUSLY A STATEMENTS ON THE
CURRENT STATE OF AMERICA.

38
00:01:54,939 --> 00:02:01,109
HIS EXAGGERATED DANCE MOVES ARE
AN OBVIOUS REFERENCE TO HOW

39
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:06,069
AMERICA VIEWS LACKS HISTORICALLY
AS ENTERTAINERS AND ARE HAPPY TO

40
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:11,101
HAVE THEM ENTERTAINED THEM, BUT
THEIR ACTUAL BODIES, THEIR

41
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:14,140
DEAD BODIES ARE LESS RELEVANT
AND DO NOT GET THE

42
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,890
ATTENTION AND HE REALLY
EMPHASIZED THAT IN THE VIDEO.

43
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,130
YOU CAN SEE THAT A LOT
BECAUSE HE IS DOING THESE VERY

44
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,659
POPULAR DANCE MOVES THAT WERE
MADE POPULAR BY PEOPLE WITHIN

45
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:27,640
THE BLACK COMMUNITY AND HE IS
DOING THAT AT THE FOREFRONT

46
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,800
WHILE IN THE BACKGROUND SO MUCH
IS GOING ON SO WE CAN GO

47
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,569
STRAIGHT TO THE NEXT ONE, WHERE
YOU CAN SEE HIM DANCING AROUND

48
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:38,060
WHERE ALL OF THIS VIOLENCE, A
POLICE CAR, ALL OF THIS

49
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,860
CRAZINESS IS GOING ON IN THE
BACKGROUND WHICH IS REALLY, TO

50
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,260
YOUR POINT, TALKING ABOUT HOW WE
ARE HAPPY TO ELEVATE BLACK

51
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,650
ENTERTAINERS, WE ARE HAPPY TO
APPRECIATE BLACK CULTURE AND

52
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,239
APPRECIATE BLACK MUSIC BUT THEN
WHEN IT COMES TO VIOLENCE

53
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:56,609
AGAINST BLACK PEOPLE, NOBODY
REALLY CARES.

54
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,580
EVERYBODY IS FOCUSING ON WHAT IS
ON THE FOREFRONT AND THAT

55
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,640
IS VERY PROBLEMATIC IN OUR
COUNTRY.

56
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,090
THIS IS AMERICA.

57
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:07,269
RIGHT SO THAT'S A COMEDY OF
HOW WE TREAT BLACK ENTERTAINERS

58
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:11,841
VERSUS THE FAR MORE COMMON
AFRICAN-AMERICAN EXPERIENCE IN

59
00:03:11,841 --> 00:03:15,140
THIS COUNTRY IS WHAT HE IS
POINTING OUT AGAIN IN A WAY THAT

60
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,790
I THINK IS AMAZING.

61
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,120
SAYING LIKE, THE REAL PROBLEMS
ARE IN THE BACKGROUND AND

62
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,900
NO ONE CARES AND IN FACT, THEY
WILL ACTIVELY FIGHT AGAINST

63
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:28,500
IT, FIGHT AGAINST FIXING IT, BUT
AS LONG AS YOU ARE DANCING

64
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,240
IN FRONT OF PEOPLE AND
ENTERTAINING THEM THEY ARE

65
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,280
LIKE OKAY THAT IS GOOD, WE LIKE
THAT.

66
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,989
AND THEN OF COURSE THERE IS THE
CHARLESTON REFERENCE.

67
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:35,989
LET'S PULL UP THAT IMAGE
RIGHT NOW.

68
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:38,689
YOU CAN SEE THIS REAL
BACK-AND-FORTH IN THE VIDEO

69
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:41,930
BETWEEN JOY AND PAIN AND SO
THERE ARE THESE CHOIR

70
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,730
MEMBERS WHO THINK THEY'RE
SINGING THE CHORUS.

71
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,749
HE COMES IN WITH ONE LOOKS LIKE
SOME SORT OF SEMI AUTOMATIC

72
00:03:46,749 --> 00:03:51,239
WEAPON AND HE HAS DANCING AND
THEN JUST SHOOT THEM ALL

73
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,870
WITHOUT EVEN BLINKING AN EYE,
KEEPS ON DANCING.

74
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,170
THE BODIES ARE LEFT JUST TO
REMAIN THERE WHEREAS THE GUN

75
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:01,439
AGAIN IS TAKEN CAREFULLY AWAY
FROM HIM AND HE REMAINS

76
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,519
UNTOUCHED, UNSCATHED WHICH IS
SIMILAR TO WHAT HAPPENED IN THE

77
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,920
2015 CHARLESTON SHOOTING WHERE
THIS MAN JUST WENT IN, SHOT UP

78
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,900
A CHURCH, HE WAS, HE
WENT TO JAIL BUT WAS NOT

79
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,389
TREATED FORCIBLY OR ANYTHING
LIKE THAT.

80
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,750
THE FAMOUS STORY ABOUT HOW
THEY TREATED THE CHARLESTON

81
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,620
SHOOTER WAS THAT ONCE THEY
ARRESTED HIM THEY TOOK HIM TO A

82
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,870
BURGER KING AND GOT A MEAL AND
SO THAT GOT UNDER A LOT OF

83
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:32,710
PEOPLE SKIN VERY UNDERSTANDABLY,
SO PEOPLE SAID A CHOIR, IS

84
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,199
THAT OVER-THE-TOP.

85
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,610
THE CHARLESTON SHOOTING HAPPENED
AT A CHURCH AND A BIBLE STUDY.

86
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,509
IT WAS A JOYOUS MOMENT, THE GUY
CAME IN AND MURDERS THEM

87
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:45,069
AND WALKS OUT AND THE COPS GIVE
HIM BURGER KING.

88
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:49,830
OF COURSE IT IS A REFERENCE TO
THAT AND WELL DONE, AGAIN.

89
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:54,340
PART OF THE SYMBOLISM HERE
IS HE IS SAYING IF ALL YOU

90
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,849
WERE GOING TO DO IS FOCUS ON US
SINGING AND ENTERTAINING

91
00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:00,569
YOU THEN I AM GOING TO PUT IN
THE SONG AND I'M GOING TO

92
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:01,930
PUT IN THE VIDEO.

93
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:02,970
PERFECT.

94
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,509
I LOVE THAT.

95
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:07,060
EVERYTHING IN THIS VIDEO IS
SO GENIUS.

96
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:12,449
THE NEXT PART, HE SAYS THIS IS A
TOOL.

97
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:17,990
IT'S A REFERENCE TO STEPHON
CLARK, BUT ALSO THE FACT

98
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,849
THAT PEOPLE ARE NOW USING
CELL PHONES THROUGH THE

99
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:23,470
DOCUMENTS WHAT IS HAPPENING
WITHIN THE BLACK COMMUNITY

100
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:27,129
ESPECIALLY POLICE FOR TALLADEGA
AGAINST THEM AND IT IS SO

101
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:28,440
GREAT THAT HE TALKS ABOUT THAT.

102
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,629
YOU CAN USE THIS AS A TOOL AND I
LOVE THAT HE DOES THAT AND

103
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:34,470
THEN THE LAST SCENE IS HIM
RUNNING THROUGH THIS

104
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,849
EXTREMELY DARK HALLWAY WITH HIS
EYES BULGING AND MANY ARE

105
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:41,990
SAYING THAT THAT IS A REFERENCE
TO THE SUNKEN PLACE, IT'S A

106
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,099
REFERENCE BACK TO GET OUT.

107
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:48,289
THERE IS A LOT GOING ON IN
THIS VIDEO BUT IT IS GENIUS.

108
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:53,349
ALL OF THE SYMBOLISM IS THERE
AND I WATCHED IT AT LEAST FIVE

109
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:56,900
TIMES AND EVERY TIME I FELT
LIKE I NOTICED SOMETHING

110
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,550
DIFFERENT AND SOMETHING NEW AND
I AM PROBABLY MISSING STILL

111
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,539
HALF OF THE SYMBOLISM HE PUT
INTO THE STOCK

112
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:06,820
I AM TOO, AND I HOPE ONE DAY
HE EXPLAINS IT ALL OR MAYBE

113
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,120
HE DOESN'T AND LEAVES AS A WORK
OF ART.

114
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,840
THE STEPHON CLARK WAS SHOT BY
COPS IN HIS OWN BACKYARD.

115
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,990
HE HAD A CELL PHONE AND THE COPS
SAID THEY SHOT HIM BECAUSE

116
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,840
THEY WERE WORRIED IT WAS A TOOL.

117
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,300
THEY THOUGHT HE WAS USING IT TO
BREAK INTO CARS.

118
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,300
IT TURNS

119
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,500
OUT IT WAS A CELL PHONE AND HE
DID NOT HAVE A WEAPON AT ALL.

120
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A REFERENCE
TO THE SUNKEN PLACE WHEN HE

121
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,509
IS RUNNING OUT OR JUST
COMMENTARY ON

122
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:35,430
AFRICAN-AMERICANS RUNNING FROM
THE POLICE AND OFTEN TIMES

123
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,520
PEOPLE WILL SAY WHY WERE THEY
RUNNING IN THE FIRST PLACE?

124
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,389
AFTER YOU HAVE SEEN ALL THE
CARNAGE IN THE VIDEO, WHO

125
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:42,840
IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD RUN?

126
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:49,419
EITHER WAY, INCREDIBLY WELL PUT
TOGETHER AND IT HAD THIS

127
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:50,720
FUNNY EFFECT ON ME.

128
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,490
THE SERIES ATLANTA IS A REALLY
WELL RECEIVED, IT HAS A TON

129
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,970
OF GREAT REVIEWS FROM CRITICS,
ETC.

130
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,440
BUT IT IS HARD TO KEEP

131
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,541
UP WITH ALL THE SHOWS THAT AFTER
WATCHING THIS VIDEO I AM

132
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,930
LIKE I'M GOING TO GO BACK AND
WATCH ATLANTA.

133
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,400
THIS GUY IS AWESOME.

134
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,979
I BELIEVE IT IS THE SAME
DIRECTOR.

135
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:13,430
HE IS AMAZING, HE IS
MULTITALENTED AND THERE SO

136
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,430
MANY THINGS IN THIS VIDEO.

137
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,189
ANOTHER ASPECT, ONE THING I WANT
TO BRING UP IS HE HAS THE

138
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:22,830
WHITE HORSE WITH THE CLOAKED
HENCHMEN ON IT WHICH IS A

139
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,520
REFERENCE TO THE APOCALYPSE AND
HE IS SAYING THIS IS AMERICA

140
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,850
AND THAT IS KIND OF HOW I FEEL
EVERY DAY BUT I CAN'T EVEN

141
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,620
IMAGINE FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY
THAT IS GOING THROUGH ALL

142
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:36,220
OF THIS JUST CONSTANT VIOLENCE
AND DISRESPECT BY OUR COUNTRY.

143
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,590
IT IS APPARENTLY THE FIRST
HORSE OF THE APOCALYPSE AND

144
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:44,860
IT IS THE BACKGROUND WHILE HE IS
STILL DANCING AND EVERYONE

145
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,470
IS PAYING ATTENTION TO THE
DANCING.

146
00:07:47,470 --> 00:00:00,000
THE APOCALYPSE HAS BEGUN.
