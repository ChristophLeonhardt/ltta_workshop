remember by clock Professor Eric Clanton is bleeding hi Clanton who used to teach ethics at Diablo Valley College in California was facing 11 years in prison for that April 2017 assault and others and guess how much time he'll actually have to serve zero strap yourselves in because this has got to be the wackiest campus on master yet the investigation into Professor Eric Clanton is one of the most impressive feats of citizen journalism in the digital age users of that delightfully devilish site 4chan looked at images of the by clock attackers facial structure clothing and backpack straps and match them up with those of Eric Clanton police arrested Clanton about a month later and the professor was charged with a simple battery misdemeanor a felony for causing great bodily injury three felony assaults with a deadly weapon and another misdemeanor for wearing a mask to avoid getting identified while committing a crime now Clanton was facing up to eleven years in prison for these charges but get this California entered into a plea deal with Clanton in which the state dropped all of the felony assault charges in exchange for Clanton pleading no contest to the simple battery misdemeanor Clanton is only getting three years on probation he already served those four days of confinement remember this is a guy who according to police had bludgeoned at least seven people with a bike lock this is also the same guy who dismissed the concept of a moral high-ground as something created by the narrative class Wow I bet he made a great ethics professor but is this really how we're going to treat political violence in the West a slap on the wrist I called the Alameda County District Attorney's Office multiple times but just got a voicemail my guess is that they knew a storm was coming and batten down the hatches if you want to share your opinion on Clanton sentencing it looks like you can do so by either phone or email here's the part of the video where I typically say for campus unmasked I'm Rob sim shock but what's the point of unmasking these criminals if the systems we have in place to punish them refuse to do so whether out of simple corruption or out of a desire to protect the bad guys so long as they have the right politics if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus unmask calm you
