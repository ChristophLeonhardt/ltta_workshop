well EPA Administrator Scott Pruett is trying to save his job amid a barrage of bed headlines over his unusual housing arrangement through at least a condo from the wife of a top energy lobbyist paying just $50 a night which is cheap in Washington I can tell you Pruitt defended himself in an interview with Fox News let's listen it's draining the swamp renting an apartment from the wife of a Washington lobbyist I don't think that that's even remotely fair to ask that question okay so why did you then accept $50 a night to rent a condo from the wife of a Washington well let's talk about that that is something that again has been reviewed by ethics officials here they've said that its market rate wearing it from the wife of obvious yeah who has no business before they say hold on you all night you rent that you were there that's exactly right but that's that's kind of a sweetheart deal because well the EPA's top ethics official clarified his initial sign-off on the arrangement saying he likes some key facts when concluding it didn't violate gift rules well the EPA inspector general is now reviewing the allegations The Daily Beast reports that during a call to put on Tuesday chief of staff John Kelly impressed upon Pruitt that though he has the full public confidence of President Trump for now the flow of negative and damning stories needed to stop soon well here's what president self said about his EPA chief early in the week great well today Trump went even further saying I think Scott has done a fantastic job I think he's a fantastic person meanwhile late today came more problematic news for Pruitt the New York Times reported at least five officials that the Environmental Protection Agency for them high-ranking were reassigned or demoted or requested new jobs in the past year after they raised concerns about the spending and management of the agency's administrator that being Scott Pruett should Trump change his mind and fire Pruitt he wouldn't be the first member of the greatest cabinet to be fired or forced out human Health and Human Services Secretary Tom price was removed last year Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was reportedly fired by a tweet last month and VA secretary that's Veterans administrator David Shulkin was forced out just last week for more I'm John by Howard Fineman MSNBC and NBC News analyst Howard this is a very busy guillotine very busy and the president is madam to look the FAR's year I mean I have never seen these guys are sweating it I thinks let's start with Pruitt how does he look well let's start with him I've been talking to EPA people that I know and I've been talking to people close to Donald Trump here's the bottom line I was told by somebody very close to the president that it's not a question of whether with Scott Pruett but a question of when meaning it sounds like to me that they know more than has even been made public that they're concerned about what other things can come out the bottom line is this Grist it's not really about the NE the corruption in office per se it's not even I think the thing with the the lobbyists and the rental on the hill is less important than the fact that Scott Pruett has been behaving like a Sun King he's got the 18 person security staff he's got sirens when he goes across town he's got he's got lavish spending in his office he's got his own sort of pre presidential campaign going that made it on the front page of the New York Times last year in in a family business named Trump in an administration named Trump there can be only one Sun King there can be only one person acting like that and that's Donald Trump it's not Scott Pruett the scariest thing I think in the most annoying thing to the president about Scott Pruett is he's behaving like a man with his own agenda with his own career ahead of him with his own base and the hard right and that he's the only guy who can bring changes in the EPA the president doesn't want a cabinet of people who say they're the only ones who can do it remember what Donald Trump said at the beginning when he was in the in Cleveland at the convention he said only I alone can do it and Scott Pruett is not behaving the way Donald Trump wants him to behave it seems to me almost like one of those things I learned in physics where the same charges tell each other right exactly exactly and it takes it takes a guy with with Trump sort of ego in need to spot another guy like that in his cabinet and from the very beginning Scott Pruett has been touting himself touting his own role yes praising the president when necessary but mostly talking about what a great EPA Administrator he is going to conservative Republican gatherings and touting himself telling stories to others about how he might wanna run for governor Center in Oklahoma and then for president and you put on top of that the turmoil within the EPA that the New York Times was talking about today that's been going on for months and months really from the very beginning the spending on his office the spending on his travel the spending on his security detail and giving raises through a technicality in the EPA water law to two of his trusted advisors against the specific judgment of the White House he tried to get those raises approved through the Office of Personnel Management in the White House the White House said no Pruitt went and did it anyway that kind of thing signals to Trump not so much corruption as the threat of another ambitious person in the circle hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC
