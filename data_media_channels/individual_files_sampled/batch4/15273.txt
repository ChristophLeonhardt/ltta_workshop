there's a lot of history here in Halifax I'm standing across the street from the bank in Nova Scotia in Nova Scotia centuries old this town and there's still some parts of the history they're not destroying in fact they're actually renovating this statue behind me of Joseph how one of the fathers of the province in fact he was the first premier of Nova Scotia he resisted joining Confederation but when he lost that debate well he became a great champion of Canada you can see the plans to renovate the whole square in front of the province house and behind me we can't get access to it now because of construction is joseph how himself this town doesn't respect all of its history though they tore down a statue of Cornwallis and of course on the other coast they tore down the statue of Joseph house contemporary Sir John a MacDonald himself the reason I came here in front of Sir Joseph house I wanted to tell you a little bit about him I had not heard of him being a westerner until I was searching vainly for examples of Canadian free speech heroes can you name any Canadian free speech heroes I couldn't other than Sir Joseph how he started off as a journalist and he wrote a newspaper here in Halifax he was self trained as sort of we are at the rebel and he wrote a exposing tens of thousands of pounds worth of bribes and corruption now that's even more in 18 19th century money it was a riveting and shocking expose of the authorities of the day so he was charged with seditious treason or libelous trees and are some old offense that we actually don't have on the books anymore he defended himself with a six hour address to the jury now the judge instructed the jury to find him guilty but the jury would not they acquitted him and it was a momentous occasion for press freedom in facts that ruling at that time made Canada even freer in terms of our press than the United States with its Bill of Rights and First Amendment at least that's how the contemporaneous reports put it well that was more than a hundred years ago I'm afraid we've lost a lot of that freedom Joseph how is still allowed to be a hero of Nova Scotia for now for now they're still renovating his statue not tearing it down for now but the actual principles that he stands for freedom of speech freedom to criticize politicians without fear freedom to do the kind of quote gutter journalism the politicians hate but we got to keep those gutters clean that freedom is being torn down for the rebel media I'm as relevance you
