1
00:00:01,018 --> 00:00:02,052
BUT FIRST, THE LIBERALS FREAK

2
00:00:02,053 --> 00:00:03,486
OUT AS TRUMP REACHES OUT.

3
00:00:03,487 --> 00:00:06,189
THAT'S A FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,258
ANGLE.

5
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:10,794
IT WAS AN AMAZING MOMENT IN THE

6
00:00:10,795 --> 00:00:12,362
OVAL OFFICE TODAY WHEN POP

7
00:00:12,363 --> 00:00:13,964
CULTURE ICON AND RAPPER

8
00:00:13,965 --> 00:00:15,198
EXTRAORDINAIRE KANYE WEST MET

9
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:16,499
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP BEFORE THE

10
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,267
CAMERA.

11
00:00:17,268 --> 00:00:18,835
HE UNLEASHED A TEN MINUTE

12
00:00:18,836 --> 00:00:20,003
MONOLOGUE WHERE HE TRIED TO

13
00:00:20,004 --> 00:00:23,573
EXPLAIN HIS LOVE OF ALL THINGS

14
00:00:23,574 --> 00:00:25,508
MEGA.

15
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:29,112
>> THEY TRY TO SCARE ME TO NOT

16
00:00:29,113 --> 00:00:31,448
WEAR THIS HAT, MY OWN FRIENDS.

17
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:33,049
BUT THIS HAT, IT GIVES ME POWER

18
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,452
AND AWAY.

19
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:38,255
MY DAD AND MY MOM SEPARATED, SO

20
00:00:38,256 --> 00:00:39,456
I DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF MAIL

21
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:41,558
ENERGY IN MY HOME.

22
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:42,659
IT WAS SOMETHING ABOUT PUTTING

23
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,261
THIS HAT ON, IT MADE ME FEEL

24
00:00:44,262 --> 00:00:45,795
LIKE SUPERMAN.

25
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:52,035
LIKE WHEN I NEED IT SATURDAY

LIBERALS TO IMPROVE ON, WHEN HE

DON'T LOOK GOOD, WE DON'T LOOK

29
00:00:59,010 --> 00:00:59,309
GOOD.

30
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,913
THIS IS OUR PRESIDENT.

31
00:01:02,914 --> 00:01:03,613
STEEL AND SOMETIMES UNLIKELY

32
00:01:03,614 --> 00:01:04,314

33
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:08,051
HISTORY TO PLAY IMPORTANT ROLES.

34
00:01:08,052 --> 00:01:10,053
ELIMINATING AT TIMES IMPORTANT

35
00:01:10,054 --> 00:01:10,453
TRUTHS.

36
00:01:10,454 --> 00:01:13,456
TODAY, KANYE WEST IN HIS OWN NET

37
00:01:13,457 --> 00:01:14,391
CENTRIC WAY EXPOSING TOLERANCE

38
00:01:14,392 --> 00:01:15,258
OF THE LEFT.

39
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:16,793
THEY ARE DENUNCIATIONS OF HIS

40
00:01:16,794 --> 00:01:19,262
WHITE HOUSE APPEARANCE WERE

41
00:01:19,263 --> 00:01:20,163
IMMEDIATE AND WITHERING.

42
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:21,364
>> WHEN IT COMES TO ISSUES OF

43
00:01:21,365 --> 00:01:25,568
KANYE WEST BRINGING BLACK PEOPLE

44
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:27,604
TO PRESIDENT TRUMP, THAT'S A

45
00:01:27,605 --> 00:01:27,971
MISNOMER.

46
00:01:27,972 --> 00:01:30,273
>> IT DOESN'T SPEAK TO THE

47
00:01:30,274 --> 00:01:32,242
DIVERSITY OR THE BROAD

48
00:01:32,243 --> 00:01:33,243
EXPERIENCES OF 40 MILLION BLACK

49
00:01:33,244 --> 00:01:33,576
PEOPLE.

50
00:01:33,577 --> 00:01:36,212
>> THIS IS A REALITY TV SHOW WE

51
00:01:36,213 --> 00:01:36,646
WERE WATCHING.

52
00:01:36,647 --> 00:01:39,449
>> THAT WAS AN ASSAULT ON A

53
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:39,849
WHITE HOUSE.

54
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,452
>> AN ASSAULT ON OUR

55
00:01:42,453 --> 00:01:43,620
WHITE HOUSE?

56
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:45,221
WELL KANYE DID USE SOME COARSE

57
00:01:45,222 --> 00:01:47,991
LANGUAGE THAT HE SHOULDN'T HAVE

58
00:01:47,992 --> 00:01:51,661
USED, AND HE WAS SPEAKING HIS

59
00:01:51,662 --> 00:01:52,595
OWN TRUTHS.

60
00:01:52,596 --> 00:01:54,564
BUT IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT

61
00:01:54,565 --> 00:01:56,666
ASSAULTS OR IMPROPRIETIES IN THE

62
00:01:56,667 --> 00:01:59,169
WHITE HOUSE, WHAT ABOUT THIS?

63
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:03,239
OR THIS?

64
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,641
KANYE WEST IS HARDLY A POLITICAL

65
00:02:04,642 --> 00:02:06,443
PHILOSOPHER, AND I'VE ALWAYS

66
00:02:06,444 --> 00:02:07,243
BELIEVED THAT ENTERTAINERS

67
00:02:07,244 --> 00:02:08,545
SHOULD FIRST ENTERTAIN AND KEEP

68
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,244
THEIR POLITICS SEPARATE FROM

69
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:11,848
THEIR ART.

70
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,416
BUT I CANNOT REMEMBER ANY ARTIST

71
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:15,452
ON THE LEFT WHO WAS TREATED WITH

72
00:02:15,453 --> 00:02:17,153
THE SAME VITRIOL AND HATRED AS

73
00:02:17,154 --> 00:02:20,590
KANYE WEST HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO

74
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:21,691
SINCE HE ANNOUNCED HIS SUPPORT

75
00:02:21,692 --> 00:02:24,427

76
00:02:24,428 --> 00:02:25,395
WHEN KATY PERRY OR MILEY CYRUS

I DON'T REMEMBER ANYONE AT MSNBC

00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:34,804
OR CNN CRITICIZING THEM FOR

80
00:02:34,805 --> 00:02:38,508
LACKING POLICY EXPERIENCES.

81
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:39,209

137
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,222
THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION ARGUED

138
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,391
THAT BLACK SHOULD CAST OFF

139
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:09,459
CONSERVATIVISM FOR CONSERVATIVE

140
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,227
SOLUTIONS AND SUMMED UP HOW THE

142
00:05:14,265 --> 00:05:15,832

143
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,867
BLACKS ARE MONOLITHIC AND WILL

00:05:19,703 --> 00:05:20,603

147
00:05:22,206 --> 00:05:25,141
THE POLITICAL RIGHT WATCHES THIS

00:05:25,142 --> 00:05:31,147
HERD MENTALITY AND ACTION AND,

149
00:05:31,148 --> 00:05:32,482

BRILLIANT CONSERVATIVE ECONOMIST

159
00:05:46,864 --> 00:05:49,065
TOM SOUL WERE CREATED JUST

160
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:51,467
BECAUSE AS THOMAS NOTED, THEY

161
00:05:51,468 --> 00:05:54,370
REFUSED TO GIVE INTO THE OCCULT

162
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:55,672
MENTALITY AND CHILDLESS

163
00:05:55,673 --> 00:05:56,406
OBEDIENCE THAT HYPNOTIZED BLACK

164
00:05:56,407 --> 00:05:57,740
AMERICANS INTO MINDLESS

165
00:05:57,741 --> 00:06:01,611
POLITICAL TRANCE.

166
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:06,249
THIS IS JUSTICE THOMAS IN 2007.

167
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,218
>> WE ARE HERE NOT TO BE

168
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:10,853
PROSELYTIZED BUT TO THINK FOR

169
00:06:10,854 --> 00:06:11,221
OURSELVES.

170
00:06:11,222 --> 00:06:12,889
AND ISN'T THAT ONE OF THE

171
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:13,890
REASONS WE LOVE OUR FREE

172
00:06:13,891 --> 00:06:15,858
SOCIETY, WE GET TO THINK FOR

173
00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:17,093
OURSELVES AND MAKE OUR DECISIONS

174
00:06:17,094 --> 00:06:19,629
BASED ON CERTAIN PRINCIPLES,

175
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,930
AND, TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR

176
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:24,734
OTHERS TO DO THE SAME?

177
00:06:24,735 --> 00:06:31,407
BE ONE ABSOLUTELY.

178
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:39,415
NOW UNLESS HE IS DOING A GIANT

179
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,183
PLUNKING OF AMERICA, HE HAS GUTS

180
00:06:40,184 --> 00:06:40,550
AND GUSTO.

181
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:41,251
JUST BECAUSE HE DARES TO THINK

182
00:06:41,252 --> 00:06:43,486
FOR HIMSELF, THINK DIFFERENTLY,

183
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,788

187
00:06:54,298 --> 00:06:57,433

189
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,036

00:07:00,037 --> 00:07:03,539
IN MOMENTS LIKE THIS, THEY ARE

191
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:09,846
ABSOLUTELY INTOLERABLE.

192
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:11,114
>> I DON'T WANT TO PUT YOU IN

193
00:07:11,115 --> 00:07:14,050
THAT SPOT.

194
00:07:14,051 --> 00:07:18,421
>> I LOVE THIS GUY RIGHT HERE.

195
00:07:18,422 --> 00:07:23,993
I LOVE THIS GUY RIGHT HERE.

196
00:07:23,994 --> 00:07:29,465
>> THE MONOPOLY ON BLACK VOTERS

197
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:30,300
IS IN JEOPARDY.

198
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:31,401
THERE ARE MORE REASONS FOR THE

199
00:07:31,402 --> 00:07:40,476
LIBERALS TO BE CONCERNED.

200
00:07:40,477 --> 00:07:41,277
PRESIDENT TRUMP NOW HAS A 36

201
00:07:41,278 --> 00:07:46,282
APPROVAL RATING.

202
00:07:46,283 --> 00:07:48,051
SOME ATTRIBUTED THE RISE TO

203
00:07:48,052 --> 00:07:49,852
SUPPORT FROM CONNIE WEST AND OF

204
00:07:49,853 --> 00:07:50,687
COURSE AT HISTORIC LOW

205
00:07:50,688 --> 00:07:52,655
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN THE BLACK

206
00:07:52,656 --> 00:07:53,456
COMMUNITY.

207
00:07:53,457 --> 00:07:56,292
WHATEVER THE CAUSE, WHATEVER THE

208
00:07:56,293 --> 00:07:57,560
REASON, THE SHIFTING SUPPORT

209
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:00,096
AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICANS IS VERY,

210
00:08:00,097 --> 00:08:02,632
VERY SIGNIFICANT.

211
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:04,901
DEMOCRATS CANNOT WIN A NATIONAL

212
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:06,969
ELECTION WITHOUT THEIR HUGE

213
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:10,673
SWATH OF BLACK VOTERS, AND

214
00:08:10,674 --> 00:08:11,874
PERHAPS KANYE IS GIVING THEM A

215
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,277
REASON TO LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR

216
00:08:14,278 --> 00:08:14,811
POLITICAL ANSWERS.

217
00:08:14,812 --> 00:08:16,779
SO NEXT TIME YOU HEAR LIBERAL

218
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,448
PUNDITS WRITING HIM OFF AS A

219
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:21,584
CRAZY SLAVE DENYING LUNATIC,

220
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,853
REMEMBER, IT'S ALL ABOUT THE

221
00:08:23,854 --> 00:08:24,187
NUMBERS.

222
00:08:24,188 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY HAVE TO SMEAR WEST FOR FEAR
