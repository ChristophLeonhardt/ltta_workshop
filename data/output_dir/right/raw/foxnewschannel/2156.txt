00:00:04,116 --> 00:00:06,352
THESE ARE CALLED

2
00:00:09,088 --> 00:00:11,590
MUSICAL >> Kimberly: WE HAVE

3
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:12,224
HEARD ENOUGH EXCUSES FROM

4
00:00:12,224 --> 00:00:13,158
HILLARY CLINTON AS TO WHY SHE DD

5
00:00:13,158 --> 00:00:13,192
HILLARY CLINTON AS TO WHY SHE D'

6
00:00:13,192 --> 00:00:13,425
HILLARY CLINTON AS TO WHY SHE DT

7
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:15,728
WON THE WHITE HOUSE.

8
00:00:15,728 --> 00:00:17,830
I DIDN'T THINK THERE WERE ANY

9
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:18,597
MORE LEFT.

10
00:00:18,597 --> 00:00:18,931
BEHOLD.

11
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:20,599
THERE IS ANOTHER.

12
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:22,468
HERE IS THE LATEST.

13
00:00:22,468 --> 00:00:25,271
>> YOU MAY BE THE ONLY

14
00:00:25,271 --> 00:00:26,405
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SINCE

15
00:00:26,405 --> 00:00:28,674
WORLD WAR II WOULD STAND UP AND

16
00:00:28,674 --> 00:00:30,009
SAY I'M A CAPITAL S, AND YOU

17
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:30,809
DID.

18
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:31,544
DID IT HURT YOU?

19
00:00:31,544 --> 00:00:33,512
>> PROBABLY.

20
00:00:33,512 --> 00:00:35,881
IT'S HARD TO KNOW.

21
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:38,450
BUT IF YOU ARE IN THE IOWA

22
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,451
CAUCUSES AND 41% OF DEMOCRATS

23
00:00:39,451 --> 00:00:43,622
ARE SOCIALISTS OR SELF-DESCRIBED

24
00:00:43,622 --> 00:00:44,990
SOCIALISTS AND I AM ASKED, ARE

25
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,993
YOU A CAPITALIST, AND I SAY YES

26
00:00:47,993 --> 00:00:48,727
BUT WITH APPROPRIATE REGULATION

27
00:00:48,727 --> 00:00:50,195
AND WITH APPROPRIATE

28
00:00:50,195 --> 00:00:53,098
ACCOUNTABILITY, THAT PROBABLY

29
00:00:53,098 --> 00:00:55,234
GETS LOST.

30
00:00:55,234 --> 00:00:58,871
OH, MY GOSH SHE'S A CAPITALIST.

31
00:00:59,004 --> 00:01:02,441
YES, ANOTHER, ADDING THEM UP.

32
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:04,643
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, GREG?

33
00:01:04,643 --> 00:01:05,911
I KNOW YOU GET DELIGHTED EVERY

34
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:08,047
TIME HILLARY MAKES AN

35
00:01:08,047 --> 00:01:08,447
APPEARANCE.

36
00:01:08,447 --> 00:01:10,249
>> Greg: THIS IS ESPECIALLY

37
00:01:10,249 --> 00:01:10,983
HILARIOUS BECAUSE SHE'S RIGHT.

38
00:01:10,983 --> 00:01:13,619
A LARGE PORTION OF THE

39
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:14,720
DEMOCRATIC PARTY ARE SNIVELING

40
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,220
SOCIALISTS.

41
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,689
THEY ARE FOR UNIVERSAL BASED

42
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:20,392
INCOME, HIGHER TAXES, GUARANTEED

43
00:01:20,392 --> 00:01:22,127
JOBS.

44
00:01:22,127 --> 00:01:24,196
IDENTITY OVER THE INDIVIDUAL.

45
00:01:24,196 --> 00:01:25,898
THEY WEREN'T VOTING FOR TRUMP.

46
00:01:25,898 --> 00:01:28,734
SHE WAS THEIR ONLY CHOICE.

47
00:01:28,867 --> 00:01:30,436
PARTY WOULD DISAGREE WITH HER.

48
00:01:30,436 --> 00:01:31,604
THEY ARE CHASING A FAILED

49
00:01:31,604 --> 00:01:31,937
SYSTEM.

50
00:01:31,937 --> 00:01:35,374
WE HAVE THE MOST EFFECTIVE

51
00:01:35,374 --> 00:01:36,108
POLITICAL ECONOMICAL SYSTEM IN

52
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:37,710
THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD THAT

53
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,613
THE DEMOCRATS ARE LIKE SIDESHOW

54
00:01:40,613 --> 00:01:41,146
BOB.

55
00:01:41,146 --> 00:01:44,883
THEY KEEP WALKING INTO RAKES.

56
00:01:44,883 --> 00:01:49,488
>> Kimberly: THAT WAS A GOOD

57
00:01:49,488 --> 00:01:50,422
SYNOPSIS.

58
00:01:50,422 --> 00:01:51,423
THE ANALOGY WAS GOOD.

59
00:01:51,423 --> 00:01:53,025
I THINK WE SHOULD MOVE THIS

60
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:54,059
EXCUSE TO NUMBER ONE.

61
00:01:54,059 --> 00:01:57,062
IT HAS SOME CREDENCE.

62
00:01:57,062 --> 00:01:57,429
WELL DONE.

63
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:59,331
>> Greg: BUT IT IS A LIE TOO.

64
00:01:59,331 --> 00:02:00,532
>> Dana: INSTRUCTIVE ABOUT

65
00:02:00,532 --> 00:02:01,533
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN 2020

66
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:04,770
BECAUSE THE GROUND SHIFTED UNDER

67
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,971
HILLARY CLINTON'S FEET FROM WHEN

68
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:07,573
SHE RAN INTO THOUSAND EIGHT TO

69
00:02:07,573 --> 00:02:09,274
2016.

70
00:02:09,274 --> 00:02:10,709
IN 2008, BERNIE SANDERS COULD

71
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,277
NOT HAVE RUN AS AN AVOWED

72
00:02:12,277 --> 00:02:13,012
SOCIALIST AND WON.

73
00:02:13,012 --> 00:02:17,549
YOU THINK ABOUT THE POLITICS OF

74
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:20,219
JFK, BILL CLINTON, EVEN

75
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:20,686
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

76
00:02:20,686 --> 00:02:21,286
EVERYTHING HAD CHANGED.

77
00:02:21,286 --> 00:02:23,222
I DON'T WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO

78
00:02:23,222 --> 00:02:24,056
DO IN 2020 BECAUSE IF THE

79
00:02:24,056 --> 00:02:27,993
ECONOMY IS GOING -- IT'S GOING

80
00:02:27,993 --> 00:02:29,695
SUPER WELL NOW, CONTINUING TO

81
00:02:29,695 --> 00:02:30,796
2020 PROBABLY FOR LITTLE WHILE,

82
00:02:30,796 --> 00:02:32,431
HOW ARE THEY GOING TO MAKE AN

83
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:33,932
ARGUMENT THERE SHOULD BE

84
00:02:33,932 --> 00:02:34,800
SOMETHING DIFFERENT?

85
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,934
THAT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT.

86
00:02:35,934 --> 00:02:38,170
IF YOU LOOK AT A PLACE LIKE OHIO

87
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,505
RIGHT NOW, IT'S A HEATED

88
00:02:39,505 --> 00:02:40,472

104
00:02:56,722 --> 00:02:57,956
SCRIBBLING AT HOME TO COME UP

105
00:02:57,956 --> 00:02:59,224
WITH ANOTHER IDEA.

106
00:02:59,224 --> 00:03:00,592
THIS TACTIC IS NOT GOING TO

107

WORK.

108
00:03:01,026 --> 00:03:02,127
YOU SAW THE GROUNDSWELL OF

109
00:03:02,127 --> 00:03:08,701
SUPPORT FOR BERNIE SANDERS,

110
00:03:08,701 --> 00:03:09,401
PROGRESSIVE, FORCING THE

111
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:10,169
DEMOCRATIC PARTY TO TACK FURTHER

112
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:14,807
TO THE LEFT.

113
00:03:14,807 --> 00:03:16,008
>> Jesse: DEMOCRATS LIKE

114
00:03:16,008 --> 00:03:17,109
BERNET BECAUSE HE FIGHTS FOR THE

115
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:19,044
POOR AND HE LOOKED POOR.

116
00:03:19,044 --> 00:03:20,145
THAT REALLY HELPED HIM.

117
00:03:20,145 --> 00:03:22,281
THE HAIR AND EVERYTHING.

118
00:03:22,281 --> 00:03:23,082
DEMOCRATS DON'T DO WELL WHEN

THEY RUN REALLY WELL.

GORE, JOHN KERRY, HILLARY.

121
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:29,388
YOU NEED SOMEONE WHO IS A LITTLE

122
00:03:29,388 --> 00:03:30,122
BIT DISHEVELED AND CAN FIGHT FOR

123
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:32,658
THE LITTLE GUY.

124
00:03:32,658 --> 00:03:35,027
CAPITALISM IS A DIRTY WORD FOR

125
00:03:35,027 --> 00:03:35,427
DEMOCRATS.

126
00:03:35,427 --> 00:03:36,829
THEY LOVE SOCIALISM BUT THEY

127
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:37,629
CAN'T DEFINE IT.

128
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:39,998
YOU ASK A DEMOCRAT, WHERE HAS

129
00:03:39,998 --> 00:03:41,867
SOCIALISM WORKED?

130
00:03:41,867 --> 00:03:45,170
THEY THEY CAN'T SAY.

131
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,506
THEY WILL POINT TO SWEDEN.

132
00:03:47,506 --> 00:03:49,341
SWEDEN IS FINE IF YOU WANT TO BE

133
00:03:49,341 --> 00:03:50,442
TAKEN CARE OF FOR THE REST OF

134
00:03:50,442 --> 00:03:52,878
YOUR LIFE, IF YOU WANT TO LIVE A

135
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:53,479
MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE.

136
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,847
IF YOU START WITH NOTHING IN

THIS COUNTRY, YOU CAN HAVE A

YACHT.

139
00:03:57,116 --> 00:03:58,884
IN SWEDEN, THAT WILL NEVER

140
00:03:58,884 --> 00:03:59,218
HAPPEN.

141
00:03:59,218 --> 00:04:00,919
IN AMERICA, THERE IS UPWARD

142
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:04,990
MOBILITY AND GRIT AND IT'S

143
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:05,357
REWARDED.

144
00:04:05,357 --> 00:04:08,093
THE DEMOCRATS GET THEMSELVES IN

145
00:04:08,093 --> 00:04:09,728
TROUBLE BECAUSE THEY ARE ALWAYS

146
00:04:09,728 --> 00:04:12,598
OFFERING HANDOUTS INSTEAD OF

147
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:13,198
HAND OPS.

148
00:04:13,198 --> 00:04:15,334
>> Kimberly: THAT WAS LIKE AN

149
00:04:15,334 --> 00:04:18,403
INFOMERCIAL.

150
00:04:18,403 --> 00:04:20,471

151
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:21,607
GOOD-LOOKING POOR PEOPLE.

152
00:04:21,607 --> 00:04:25,677
I WAS POOR FOR A LONG TIME.

153
00:04:25,677 --> 00:04:28,013
>> Jesse: I AM STILL MORE

154
00:04:28,013 --> 00:04:29,615
POORER THAN YOU.

155
00:04:29,615 --> 00:04:30,716
AND BETTER LOOKING.

156
00:04:30,716 --> 00:04:31,416
>> Greg: [LAUGHS]

157
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,685
YOU JUST PROVED YOUR POINT.

158
00:04:33,685 --> 00:04:34,686
>> Kimberly: JUST A REALLY

159
00:04:34,686 --> 00:04:37,222
DOESN'T MEAN THAT.

160
00:04:37,222 --> 00:04:39,158
THERE IS A MOM TEXT COMING.

161
00:04:39,158 --> 00:04:40,025
>> Jesse: SHE ALREADY HIT ME

162
00:04:40,025 --> 00:04:45,430
UP FOR A POLL.

163
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,999
>> Juan: YOU ARE RECITING

164
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:48,233
RASMUSSEN WHICH IS CONSERVATIVE

165
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:48,600
LEANING.

166
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,904
THEY HAVE ALMOST HALF OF

167
00:04:52,037 --> 00:04:53,639
GUARANTEED JOBS IN THE COUNTRY.

168
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,107
I GUESS THEY ARE SOCIALISTS.

169
00:04:55,107 --> 00:04:57,242
WHAT YOU HAVE IN THIS MOMENT IN

170
00:04:57,242 --> 00:04:59,278
TERMS OF INCOME INEQUALITY IS A

171
00:04:59,278 --> 00:05:00,813
HEIGHTENED SENSE OF CONCERN.

172
00:05:00,813 --> 00:05:02,281
PEOPLE FEELING "I GOT LEFT

173
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:02,648
BEHIND.

174
00:05:02,648 --> 00:05:04,049
I AM NEVER GOING TO CATCH UP.

175
00:05:04,049 --> 00:05:06,285
I CAN'T GET A HOUSE AS GOOD AS

176
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:07,452
MY PARENTS."

177
00:05:07,452 --> 00:05:08,453
I REMEMBER YOU GUYS GOING AFTER

178
00:05:08,453 --> 00:05:09,655
HER LIKE CLINTON DURING THE

179
00:05:09,655 --> 00:05:11,657

180
00:05:11,657 --> 00:05:12,724

186
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,099
