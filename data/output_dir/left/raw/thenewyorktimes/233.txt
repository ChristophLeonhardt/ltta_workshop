1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:02,340
This is John
Krasinski, the director

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,449
and one of the actors
in “A Quiet Place."

3
00:00:06,449 --> 00:00:08,490
What you’re watching now
is at the very beginning

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,660
of the movie.

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,930
This is our hero
family walking home

6
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,679
from a — now established
as an abandoned town.

7
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:19,220
And this sort of sets up a lot
of the rules of the movie, one

8
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,636
of which you’re
seeing right here,

9
00:00:20,636 --> 00:00:22,602
which is the idea of
perspective and sound.

10
00:00:22,602 --> 00:00:24,440
[light footsteps]

11
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,010
When we’re close
up on something,

12
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:26,970
you can really hear it.

13
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,511
And then when you
go to a wider shot,

14
00:00:28,511 --> 00:00:30,390
you can’t hear that
exact same sound,

15
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,490
which is one of the things
we really loved doing

16
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,050
throughout the whole movie.

17
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,240
We shot this film
in Upstate New York.

18
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,390
The idea was to be in a
very rural area in sort

19
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,730
of a post-apocalyptic
time to feel isolation.

20
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,490
And so being in the
middle of nowhere

21
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,949
helps this family
feel like they’re

22
00:00:45,949 --> 00:00:46,990
in the middle of nowhere.

23
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,840
And it adds tension,
I think, to the fact

24
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,240
that they have nowhere to
turn or nobody around them

25
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,830
to help them.

26
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,460
Sound design in this is huge.

27
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,570
It’s totally a main
character that is right along

28
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,780
here with the family.

29
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,660
So Millie, one of the
actresses, is a deaf actress.

30
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,159
And we’re about to do
one of my favorite things

31
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,200
in the movie, which is
play with her perspective.

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,870
We wanted the sound of
the movie to reflect

33
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,400
her own actual experience.

34
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,620
So you can hear sound when
you’re walking with Emily

35
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,985
and I, like this, and with Noah.

36
00:01:16,985 --> 00:01:19,210
[light footsteps]

37
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,820
And then right here, you cut to
Millie, and we pull sound out.

38
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:26,440
So we’re in “the envelope,"
we called it — the envelope

39
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,310
being in her head, she can
hear very little thanks

40
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,570
to a hearing aid that she has.

41
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,922
But she can’t hear
much of anything.

42
00:01:33,922 --> 00:01:36,130
And so we play with that
throughout the entire movie.

43
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,470
So she can’t tell that
there’s a sound being

44
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,940
made behind her right now.

45
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,980
And so this is her
perspective — seeing me run,

46
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,410
seeing me look scared,
but she doesn’t know why.

47
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,922
And then she
realizes right here.

48
00:01:45,922 --> 00:01:48,130
And when she realizes is
that her little brother just

49
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,630
made the first big
sound of the movie.

50
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:55,390
And you can see that that sound
has horrible consequences.

51
00:01:55,390 --> 00:00:00,000
