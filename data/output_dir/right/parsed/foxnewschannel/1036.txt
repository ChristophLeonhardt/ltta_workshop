7:35 IN THE MORNING IF YOU'RE JT
WAKING UP, WE'RE CONTINUING OUR
BREAKING COVERAGE AHEAD OF THE
MEETING BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP
AND KIM JONG UN IN SINGAPORE.
SECURITY MEASURES ARE AT AN
ALL-TIME HIGH, OUR COMMANDER IN
CHIEF EXPECTED TO TOUCH DOWN IN
SINGAPORE IN ABOUT AN HOUR.
ABBY: THE ROGUE REGIME'S LEADER
SEEN JUST MOMENTS AGO WITH
DIPLOMATS AFTER ARRIVING TO THE
ST. REGIS HOTEL.
RICH EDSON JOINS US LIVE ON THE
GROUND IN SINGAPORE.
RICH, IT IS ALL HAPPENING.
>> Reporter: IT IS ALL
HAPPENING, ABBY AND GRIFF, AND
SECURITY IS VERY TIGHT HERE IN
SINGAPORE.
SECURITY'S TIGHT NO MATTER WHERE
OR WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES TRAVEL, BUT THEN
YOU PUT ON THE ADDED LAYER OF
SECURITY REQUIRED WHEN THE
LEADER OF NORTH KOREA TRAVELS.
KIM JONG UN TOUCHED DOWN HERE A
SHORT WHILE AGO.
WHEN HE LANDED IN SINGAPORE, IT
WAS THE THIRD COUNTRY THAT KIM
HAS BEEN TO SINCE ASSUMING
LEADERSHIP OF NORTH KOREA IN
2011.
HE HAS TRAVELED TWICE TO CHINA
AND STEP OVER THE DEMILITARIZED
ZONE LINE INTO SOUTH KOREA TO
MEET THE SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT,
MOON JAE-IN.
SO IT IS UNUSUAL FOR A NORTH
KOREAN LEADER TO BE SO FAR FROM
HOME, AND SECURITY IS A
PARTICULAR CONCERN FOR NORTH
KOREA.
THE UNITED STATES AND NORTH
KOREA CHOSE SINGAPORE IN PART
BECAUSE IT HAS HOSTED
INTERNATIONAL SUMMITS BEFORE.
THEY'VE GOT THE SECURITY ROUTINE
DOWN.
AND TO BE HONEST, THE ROUTINING
SECURITY HERE IS ALREADY ROBUST.
THE COUNTRY HAS CLOSED CERTAIN
AREAS OF THE CITY, AND THERE IS
TIGHT SECURITY THROUGHOUT MUCH
OF IT.
POLICE SAY THEY HAVE ALREADY
ARRESTED SOUTH KOREAN
JOURNALISTS WERE TRESPASSING ON
THE NORTH KOREAN AMBASSADOR'S
PROPERTY.
THE PRESIDENT AND KIM JONG UN
WILL MEET ON A SECLUDED,
EXCLUSIVE RESORT HERE ON AN
ISLAND JUST OFF THE COAST OF
MAINLAND SINGAPORE.
AS FOR THE EXPECTATIONS OF THIS
SUMMIT AND WHAT WOULD QUALIFY AS
A SUCCESSFUL SUMMIT, WELL, THE
PRESIDENT SAYS THAT IT COULD BE
ANYWHERE FROM JUST ESTABLISHING
A GOOD RAPPORT, A GOOD
RELATIONSHIP WITH KIM JONG UN TO
SOMETHING BIGGER THAN THAT.
SO THE PRESIDENT HAS NOTED THAT
IF HE FEELS THIS SUMMIT WILL NOT
BE A SUCCESS, THAT HE WILL NOT
WASTE HIS TIME, NOR KIM JONG
