I love you. I love you.
This is Jerusalem. I call this Jerusalem.
This is where â€” this is so peaceful.
I drink my tea. I come out here, 
me and my son,
we meditate, we catch a vibe.
I feel like I'm just in a whole 
other country. You know what I'm saying?
See that waterfall on that pool? 
The sound of the water.
I think I'm on the ocean.
You noticed how the sun is shining on me?
Everywhere I walk the sun
is shining on me. When I walk, in the 
house, the sun is fighting through
the windows to make sure it shines on me.
All praise to the most high! Grateful.
Look at this beautiful purple flowers.
I love you. I love you.
So beautiful man. Let me 
show you something.
You know when I drink my tea, 
you need lemon.
So I went and got a lemon tree.
I come out here every morning and eat
breakfast and lunch. Fire pit.
I catch a vibe always. 
Always catch a vibe.
I love you. I love you.
The key is: Respect your mother.
Respect Mother Nature at all times.
