contingency plans the likely things that might go wrong those are critical there's situations where some leaders don't even come up with contingency plans for likely things that are going to happen and that's a disaster you can't do that because then that's gonna set your team up for failure and it's going to certainly impede your ability to accomplish the mission so what you have to do is balance that not over plan but have some planning and what that girion looked like for us in combat was come up with the most likely three or four contingencies that might happen for each phase of an operation so if I'm about to kick-off a major operation I'm gonna look at what the first the one two or three things that are likely to go wrong I'm gonna focus on those things and then I might play it plan for that and then I might also plan for that worst-case scenario as well so you think through those things so the team knows how to react to those things that are prepared to prevent those things from happening or prepare to react to them when they do go wrong and yet you absolutely can take that too far in in the other direction and over plan so let's say a business has a project that they're planning for next quarter and it's a complicated project now they have to do some planning there's no doubt about it but we see businesses sometimes where they invest so much time and so much effort into their planning that they actually never make any progress on getting the project done or at least they take away from their effort to actually execute the project so what you have to do is you have to be sensible what you have to do is you have to find the balance you certainly have to plan but you can't spend so much time doing your planning that you never get anything actually done well the first patrols I went out with with the Marine Corps in a really dangerous area of downtown Ramadi and when we were going out on this operation we knew we're gonna be out there for at least 24 hours we knew it could be even longer so I loaded out for World War three I packed extra grenades and extra magazines with with rounds and extra water and extra food and batteries and radios and everything that you could possibly imagine to try to cover all these contingencies in the event that we got extended out there at the event that we were about to be overrun by a larger enemy force and what did to me was burdened me down to a point where I was so heavy the weight that I was carrying on my back in my rucksack that I could barely keep up with a patrol and I certainly couldn't lead that patrol and that actually put me in a much more dangerous situation because I tried the plan for every single contingency so you could take any of these things too far you got a plan what you can't over plan once the decision gets made you've got to be able to get behind that plan and execute the plan as if it were your own plan it doesn't matter if you came up with it or someone else came up with it if you're a good leader and you see hey this person came up with a great idea let's give that idea shot they're in a better position to actually run with that idea I'm gonna follow and I'm gonna let them lead because I don't care who gets the credit I just want the team to win and the best leader is gonna be able to do that
