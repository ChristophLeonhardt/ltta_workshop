LEARNED. THAT’S THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT’S "ANGLE" ." WE SAW THIS COMING ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO WHEN SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BRETT KAVANAUGH REMEMBER WHEN HE FIRST APPEARED BEFORE THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE? RATHER THAN MOUNT ANY SERIOUS ARGUMENT, DEMOCRATS AND THEIR ACTIVIST ALLIES RESORTED TO THEATRICS AND PAID, PREPLANNED PROTESTS. I WELCOME EVERYONE TO THIS CONFIRMATION HEARING ON THE NOMINATION MR. CHAIRMAN DRUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH. WE CANNOT POSSIBLY MOVE FORWARD, MR. CHAIRMAN YOU ARE OUT OF ORDER. MR. CHAIRMAN, AND MAKE SENSATIONS Laura: BARNUM AND BAILEY WOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD. UNABLE TO STOP KAVANAUGH, BASED ON HIS JUDICIAL RECORD, WHICH IS ON HIS JUDICIAL RECORD, WHICH IS STELLAR, DEMOCRATS RESORTED TO THIS LATE IN THE GAME SMEAR DROP THAT THEY TRIED WITH MY OLD BOSS, CLARENCE THOMAS, 17 YEARS AGO. YOU ALL KNOW BY NOW THAT DIANNE FEINSTEIN SAT ON DR. CHRISTINE FORD’S ALLEGATIONS DR. CHRISTINE FORD’S ALLEGATIONS FOR SIX WEEKS, NEVER BRINGING IT FOR SIX WEEKS, NEVER BRINGING IT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, UNTIL OF COURSE IT WAS CONVENIENTLY LEAKED. THIS ALLEGED ASSAULT HAS NOT BEEN CONFIRMED BY ANY OF THE FOUR OTHER PEOPLE THAT SHE CLAIMS WERE AT THE PARTY IN QUESTION. SHE WAS 15 AND KAVANAUGH WAS 17. SHE WAS 15 AND KAVANAUGH WAS 17. AND THEN YESTERDAY, A WEEK AFTER AND THEN YESTERDAY, A WEEK AFTER THE FOUR DELEGATION CAME TO LIGHT, ANOTHER DECADES-OLD CLAIM SERVED SURFACE, THIS TIME IN "THE NEW YORKER." COLLEGE CLASSMATE OF KAVANAUGH, DEBORAH RAMIREZ, CLAIMS THAT WHILE A FRESHMAN IDEAL, HE EXPOSED HIMSELF TO HER AT A BOOZY DORM PARTY. EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS DRINKING SO MUCH, SO MUCH SO THAT SHE WAS SLURRING HER WORDS AND FOGGY, RAMIREZ SAYS HE SAW KAVANAUGH PULLING UP HIS PANTS AFTER SOMEONE EXPOSED THEMSELVES TO HER. IT COULD HAVE BEEN HIM. WRITER RONAN FAIR RONAN FARROW A WRITER RONAN FAIR RONAN FARROW D WRITER RONAN FAIR RONAN FARROW J WRITER RONAN FAIR RONAN FARROW N NOTE THAT "THE NEW YORKER" WRITER RONAN FAIR RONAN FARROW E WRITER RONAN FAIR RONAN FARROW E MAYER COUCHED THE ALLEGATION SAYING "SENATE DEMOCRATS INVESTIGATE NEW ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT FROM BRETT KAVANAUGH’S COLLEGE YEARS." SO WHATEVER THE DEMOCRATS ARE WITNESS, THE "THE NEW YORKER" AM WITNESS, THE "THE NEW YORKER" AT INVESTIGATING, IT LACKS A WITNESS, THE "THE NEW YORKER" AS WITNESS, THE "THE NEW YORKER" AS THAT NO ONE WITNESSED THIS ALLEGED INCIDENT. IN FACT, RAMIREZ’S ROOMMATE, WHO IN FACT, RAMIREZ’S ROOMMATE, WHO CLAIMS THAT THEY SHARED EVERYTHING, HEARD NOTHING OF IT. EVERYTHING, HEARD NOTHING OF IT. THE ONLY PERSON THAT THE DYNAMIC THE ONLY PERSON THAT THE DYNAMIC JOURNALISTIC DUO OF BARROW AND MAYER COULD FIND TO SUBSTANTIATE MAYER COULD FIND TO SUBSTANTIATE THE CLAIMS REALLY DIDN’T. THE CORROBORATING WITNESS THAT YOU SAYS HAS ALL THE DETAILS INCLUDING KAVANAUGH’S NAME, WHERE DID THAT WITNESS COME FROM AND WHERE DID THEY GET COME FROM AND WHERE DID THEY GET THE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS FROM, THE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS FROM, IF THAT PERSON DOESN’T KNOW RAMIREZ? HE REMEMBERS THAT HE WAS IN THE SAME DORM, SAME LITTLE BUILDING ON YALE’S OLD CAMPUS. HE REMEMBERS IT CLEARLY. I ASKED HIM, WE WERE GOING TO BE I ASKED HIM, WE WERE GOING TO BE VERY CAREFUL HE HEARD IT FROM VERY CAREFUL HE HEARD IT FROM SOMEONE WHO WAS THERE. Laura: HE HEARD IT FROM SOMEONE AND A SMALL LITTLE DORM ON THE OLD CAMPUS. GREAT REPORTING. ENTER STAGE LEFT THE OLD GRAY LADY, "THE NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTS THAT THEY SPENT A WEEK TRYING TO VERIFY THE RAMIREZ STORY, INTERVIEWING SEVERAL DOZEN PEOPLE, BUT DRUMROLL PLEASE "COULD FIND NO ONE WITH FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE. THAT IS WHY THEY DIDN’T RUN WITH THAT IS WHY THEY DIDN’T RUN WITH IT. MR. MRAZ CONTACTED FORMER YALE CLASSMATES AND SHE ASKED IF THEY CLASSMATES AND SHE ASKED IF THEY WERE CALLED IF THE INCIDENT NEVER HAPPENED AND TOLD SOME OF THEM THAT SHE HERSELF COULD NOT BE CERTAIN THAT MR. KAVANAUGH WAS THE ONE WHO EXPOSED HIMSELF. WAS THE ONE WHO EXPOSED HIMSELF. BUT WITHIN A SPAN OF SIX DAYS AND AFTER CONSULTING WITH CLASSMATES AND DEMOCRATS, RAMIREZ MAGICALLY RECOVERED HER HIDDEN MEMORIES. HERE’S RONAN FARROW. WHY DID YOU COME FORWARD? SHE CAME FORWARD BECAUSE SENATE DEMOCRATS BEGAN LOOKING AT THIS CLAIM. Laura: AHA! NOW I KNOW WHY THE WHOLE CREW WAS SO DESPERATELY WANTING TO PUT OFF THOSE KAVANAUGH-FORD HEARINGS, WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY SCHEDULED FOR TODAY. THEY NEEDED THEIR PILES IN THE MEDIA TO HAVE ADDITIONAL TIME TO MEDIA TO HAVE ADDITIONAL TIME TO JUMP ON WHAT THEY WERE INVESTIGATING, THE DEMOCRATS, AND FIND SOMEONE, ANYONE, WHO KNEW KAVANAUGH AND COULD LEVEL A KNEW KAVANAUGH AND COULD LEVEL A SALACIOUS, OUTRAGEOUS CHARGE AGAINST THEM. WHO IS DEBORAH RAMIREZ? WE DON’T KNOW ALL THAT MUCH ABOUT HER. SHE’S A REGISTERED DEMOCRAT WHO "THE NEW YORKER" SAYS WORKS ON BEHALF OF "SOCIAL JUSTICE AND SOCIAL CHANGE." OF COURSE, RIGHT ON CUE, FEINSTEIN IS NOW DEMANDING THAT THURSDAY’S HEARING BE POSTPONED TO THE THIRD WEEK OF... NEVER. KAVANAUGH IS HIMSELF DEFIANT, STANDING HIS GROUND AS HE TOLD MARTHA MacCALLUM TONIGHT. THE TRUTH IS, I’VE NEVER SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ANYONE. IN HIGH SCHOOL OR OTHERWISE. I AM NOT QUESTIONING AND HAVE NOT QUESTIONED THAT PERHAPS DR. FORD AT SOME POINT IN HER LIFE WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY SOMEONE IN SOMEPLACE BUT WHAT I KNOW IS THAT I HAVE NEVER SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ANYONE. I WANT A FAIR PROCESS WHERE I CAN DEFEND MY INTEGRITY, AND I KNOW I AM TELLING THE TRUTH. I KNOW MY LIFELONG RECORD. I’M NOT GOING TO LET FALSE ACCUSATIONS DRIVE ME OUT OF THIS ACCUSATIONS DRIVE ME OUT OF THIS PROCESS. I HAVE FAITH IN GOD AND I HAVE FAITH IN THE FAIRNESS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. Laura: THE AMERICAN PEOPLE MAY BE FAIR BUT THE DEMOCRATS ON MAY BE FAIR BUT THE DEMOCRATS ON THE COMMITTEE ARE CIRCLING. DOESN’T KAVANAUGH HAVE THE SAME PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE AS SAME PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE AS ANYONE ELSE IN AMERICA? I PUT HIS DENIAL IN THE CONTEXT OF EVERYTHING THAT I KNOW ABOUT HIM IN TERMS OF HOW HE APPROACHES HIS CASES. HIS CREDIBILITY IS ALREADY VERY QUESTIONABLE IN MY MIND AND IN THE MINDS OF A LOT OF MY FELLOW JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBERS, THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBERS, THE DEMOCRATS. Laura: SHE GAVE IT ALL THE WAY THERE. IT’S NOT ABOUT WHETHER THESE WOMEN HAVE BEEN WRONG. MANY OF THEM PROBABLY HAVE. IT’S NOT ABOUT RESPECTING THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE, EITHER. THIS IS ABOUT DENYING DONALD TRUMP A FIFTH VOTE ON THE DONALD TRUMP A FIFTH VOTE ON THE SUPREME COURT. BUT THE DEMOCRATS, I’M TELLING YOU, THEY SHOULD TAKE A BREATH, AND THEY SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE NEW STANDARD THEY ARE SITTING HERE FOR ALL NOMINEES GOING FORWARD. ARE WE REALLY SUGGESTING THAT ALL ASPECTS OF FUTURE DEMOCRATIC ALL ASPECTS OF FUTURE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEES, THEIR HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE BEHAVIOR, THAT SHOULD BE COLLEGE BEHAVIOR, THAT SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO SCRUTINY AND INVESTIGATION? WELL, THAT SHOULD BE LOADS OF FUN. THE REPUBLICANS SHOULD HAVE HELD THE VOTE LAST WEEK AS PLANNED. KEN STARR SAID THAT A WEEK AGO ON THIS PROGRAM. THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE INDULGED THE CIRCUS. HAD THEY DONE SO, THE RIGHT WAY, HAD THEY DONE SO, THE RIGHT WAY, JUSTICE AND KAVANAUGH WOULD ALREADY BE SETTLING INTO HIS NEW ALREADY BE SETTLING INTO HIS NEW CHAMBERS AT THE SUPREME COURT. AND A WARNING: IF HE IS NOT CONFIRMED, REPUBLICAN VOTERS MAY
