1
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:11,301
BRIAN: PRESIDENT TRUMP

2
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:12,135
TAKING ON JOHN KERRY AHEAD

3
00:00:12,135 --> 00:00:14,037
OF TODAY'S IRAN

4
00:00:14,037 --> 00:00:14,471
ANNOUNCEMENT.

5
00:00:14,471 --> 00:00:16,139
HE IS THE ONE WHO CREATED

6
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:17,273
THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE.

7
00:00:17,273 --> 00:00:18,975
THIS IN RESPONSE OF THE

8
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:20,844
SECRETARY OF STATE SHADOW

9
00:00:20,844 --> 00:00:22,579
DIPLOMACY ON THE VERY BADLY

10
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:23,513
NEGOTIATED IRANIAN DEAL.

11
00:00:23,513 --> 00:00:26,549
HE WAS THE ONE THAT -- SAVE

12
00:00:26,549 --> 00:00:28,885
THE OBAMA ERA DEAL.

13
00:00:28,885 --> 00:00:32,021
THE BEST OF LUCK

14
00:00:32,021 --> 00:00:32,055
THE BULT OF LUCK

15
00:00:32,055 --> 00:00:32,287
THE BULK OF LUCK

16
00:00:32,287 --> 00:00:32,321
THE BULK OF TUCK

17
00:00:32,322 --> 00:00:33,890
THE BULK OF THEK

18
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:34,324
THE BULK OF THE NEGOTIATION.

19
00:00:34,324 --> 00:00:35,625
HERE TO EXPLAIN CIA OFFICER

20
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,193
AND RADIO TALK SHOW HOST

21
00:00:37,193 --> 00:00:38,128
BUCK SEXTON.

22
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:39,295
BUCK, THIS SEEMS TO BE A

23
00:00:39,295 --> 00:00:40,763
VIOLATION OF THE LOGAN ACT,

24
00:00:40,763 --> 00:00:41,865
WHICH IS NEVER PROSECUTED.

25
00:00:41,865 --> 00:00:45,168
THIS IS REALLY OUT OF LINE,

26
00:00:45,168 --> 00:00:45,935
ISN'T IT?

27
00:00:45,935 --> 00:00:47,270
>> I THINK THE FORMER

28
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:48,004
SECRETARY OF STATE AND HE

29
00:00:48,004 --> 00:00:49,772
NEEDS A REMINDER THAT HE IS

30
00:00:49,772 --> 00:00:51,574
IN FACT FORMER IS WRONG ON

31
00:00:51,574 --> 00:00:52,375
EVERY CONCEIVABLE LEVEL

32
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:52,675
HERE.

33
00:00:52,675 --> 00:00:54,177
I THINK HE IS WRONG ON THE

34
00:00:54,177 --> 00:00:55,378
SUBSTANCE, WHICH PEOPLE CAN

35
00:00:55,378 --> 00:00:56,546
DISAGREE ON BUT THE IRAN

36
00:00:56,546 --> 00:00:58,181
DEAL HAS SOME FATAL FLAWS IN

37
00:00:58,181 --> 00:00:58,448
IT.

38
00:00:58,448 --> 00:00:59,749
IT HAS FROM THE START.

39
00:00:59,749 --> 00:01:01,284
BALLISTIC MISSILES, THE SUN

40
00:01:01,284 --> 00:01:03,186
SET PROVISIONS, SOME OF THE

41
00:01:03,186 --> 00:01:04,554
SITES THAT DO NOT ACTUALLY

42
00:01:04,554 --> 00:01:05,488
GET INSPECTIONS.

43
00:01:05,488 --> 00:01:07,223
WE CAN DISAGREE ON THAT.

44
00:01:07,223 --> 00:01:08,758
THAT ALL SAID, THERE IS ALSO

45
00:01:08,758 --> 00:01:10,126
A BAD FAITH ELEMENT HERE.

46
00:01:10,126 --> 00:01:12,095
YOU CAN ONLY HAVE ONE

47
00:01:12,095 --> 00:01:12,762
SECRETARY OF STATE, ONE

48
00:01:12,762 --> 00:01:13,463
ADMINISTRATION AT A TIME.

49
00:01:13,463 --> 00:01:14,664
AND FOR A FORMER SECRETARY

50
00:01:14,664 --> 00:01:16,432
OF STATE TO STEP IN HERE,

51
00:01:16,432 --> 00:01:19,402
BRIAN, AND ACT LIKE THE

52
00:01:19,402 --> 00:01:20,403
SHADOW SECRETARY OF STATE

53
00:01:20,403 --> 00:01:21,571
REALLY UNDERMINES THE

54
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:22,539
AUTHORITY OF THE PEOPLE WHO

55
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:23,840
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ENGAGED

56
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,041
IN THESE KIND OF

57
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:25,475
NEGOTIATIONS.

58
00:01:25,475 --> 00:01:27,177
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT THINK

59
00:01:27,177 --> 00:01:28,678
THAT JOHN KERRY IS COACHING

60
00:01:28,678 --> 00:01:29,646
THE OTHER SIDE HERE.

61
00:01:29,646 --> 00:01:30,947
AND THEN AS YOU MENTIONED

62
00:01:30,947 --> 00:01:32,315
THE LOGAN ACT BRINGS IN A

63
00:01:32,315 --> 00:01:34,083
LEGAL ASPECT OF IT.

64
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:35,752
LOOK, WE ALL KNOW, IT'S BEEN

65
00:01:35,752 --> 00:01:37,220
REPEATED A LOT.

66
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,988
THE LOGAN ACT HAS NEVER BEEN

67
00:01:38,988 --> 00:01:39,956
USED TO PROSECUTE ANYONE.

68
00:01:39,956 --> 00:01:41,424
IT SHOULD NOT BE USED TO

69
00:01:41,424 --> 00:01:43,193
PROSECUTE ANYONE.

70
00:01:43,193 --> 00:01:43,860
IT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL IF

71
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,327
IT'S CHALLENGED.

72
00:01:44,327 --> 00:01:45,895
THAT SAID, BRIAN, WHY DO WE

73
00:01:45,895 --> 00:01:47,597
ALL KNOW WHAT THE LOGAN ACT

74
00:01:47,597 --> 00:01:47,864
IS?

75
00:01:47,864 --> 00:01:48,298
THAT'S RIGHT.

76
00:01:48,298 --> 00:01:49,566
THERE WAS A WHOLE LOT OF

77
00:01:49,566 --> 00:01:51,167
DISCUSSION ABOUT IT WHEN IT

78
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:52,969
CAME TO GENERAL FLYNN THE

79
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:53,636
INCOMING NATIONAL SECURITY

80
00:01:53,636 --> 00:01:54,337
ADVISOR FOR TRUMP.

81
00:01:54,337 --> 00:01:57,373
THE HYPOCRISY HERE IS

82
00:01:57,373 --> 00:01:57,807
JAW-DROPPING.

83
00:01:57,807 --> 00:01:59,442
IN ONE CASE IT'S A BIG DEAL.

84
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:00,944
IN THIS CASE A MORE

85
00:02:00,944 --> 00:02:02,579
EGREGIOUS AND OBVIOUS

86
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:03,780
VIOLATION OF THE LOGAN ACT,

87
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,448
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE ARE

88
00:02:05,448 --> 00:02:05,982
CONTRADICTS ON THIS.

89
00:02:05,982 --> 00:02:11,321
AND WE WANT TO KNOW WHY.

90
00:02:11,321 --> 00:02:12,255
BRIAN: FLYNN WAS ABOUT TO

91
00:02:12,255 --> 00:02:13,523
GET THE JOB.

92
00:02:13,523 --> 00:02:14,557
KERRY IS OUT OF A JOB.

93
00:02:14,557 --> 00:02:15,959
>> CORRECT.

94
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:16,859
BRIAN: NUMBER TWO, MET WITH

95
00:02:16,859 --> 00:02:18,561
THE EU FOREIGN POLICY CHIEF.

96
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:20,563
HE HAS MET WITH MACRON OF

97
00:02:20,563 --> 00:02:20,897
FRANCE.

98
00:02:20,897 --> 00:02:22,498
HE HAS MET WITH THE GERMAN

99
00:02:22,498 --> 00:02:23,700
PRESIDENT AND MET TWICE WITH

100
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,502
THE IRANIAN FOREIGN

101
00:02:26,502 --> 00:02:26,869
MINISTER.

102
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:27,904
ALL TO KEEP THIS GOING.

103
00:02:27,904 --> 00:02:30,673
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW THE --

104
00:02:30,673 --> 00:02:33,509
ANY BUSH OFFICIAL FELT LIKE

105
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:35,278
SECRETARY OF STATE RICE

106
00:02:35,278 --> 00:02:36,246
PRESIDENT OBAMA DECIDE TO

107
00:02:36,246 --> 00:02:37,447
PULL US OUT OF IRAQ

108
00:02:37,447 --> 00:02:38,781
THEREFORE CREATING ISIS KEPT

109
00:02:38,781 --> 00:02:39,682
HIS MOUTH SHUT.

110
00:02:39,682 --> 00:02:42,218
WHAT DID SIS KISSINGER DO AS

111
00:02:42,218 --> 00:02:43,386
WE ABANDONED VIETNAM?

112
00:02:43,386 --> 00:02:44,520
HOW DID HE FEEL ABOUT THAT.

113
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,922
HE KEPT HIS MOUTH SHUT.

114
00:02:45,922 --> 00:02:47,557
IF ASKED HE WOULD RESPOND

115
00:02:47,557 --> 00:02:48,858
BUT NOT LOBBY OTHER

116
00:02:48,858 --> 00:02:49,259
GOVERNMENTS.

117
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:50,493
HERE IS WHAT THE KERRY

118
00:02:50,493 --> 00:02:51,628
SPOKESPERSON HAD TO SAY.

119
00:02:51,628 --> 00:02:52,895
HE BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT

120
00:02:52,895 --> 00:02:53,796
THE NUCLEAR AGREEMENT THAT

121
00:02:53,796 --> 00:02:56,466
TOOK THE WORLD YEARS TO

122
00:02:56,466 --> 00:03:00,470
NEGOTIATE REMAIN EFFECTIVE

123
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,371
AS COUNTRIES FOCUS ON

124
00:03:01,371 --> 00:03:02,305
STABILITY IN REGION.

125
00:03:02,305 --> 00:03:03,740
HE SAID TRUMP IS ONLY GOING

126
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,508
TO BE IN POWER A COUPLE OF

127
00:03:05,508 --> 00:03:05,808
YEARS.

128
00:03:05,808 --> 00:03:07,076
>> THIS IS SOMETHING WE

129
00:03:07,076 --> 00:03:08,144
EXPECT FROM THE TALIBAN TO

130
00:03:08,144 --> 00:03:10,079
HAVE A SHADOW GOVERNMENT IN

131
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:10,380
PLACE.

132
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,648
NOT FROM OUR OWN FORMER

133
00:03:11,648 --> 00:03:13,182
SECRETARY OF STATE.

134
00:03:13,182 --> 00:03:13,650
BRIAN: GOTCHA.

135
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,951
>> THIS IS REALLY BEYOND THE

136
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:15,518
PALE TO.

137
00:03:15,518 --> 00:03:16,419
HAVE MEETINGS LIKE THIS,

138
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:18,554
THIS IS NOT CASUAL, THIS IS

139
00:03:18,554 --> 00:03:21,391
NOT SOMEONE WHO IS JUST

140
00:03:21,391 --> 00:00:00,000
TALKING.
