1
00:00:00,357 --> 00:00:01,224
>> MAR VISTA BRING A FORMER US

AMBASSADOR TO NATO, NOW THE

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE

McCAIN INSTITUTE.

5
00:00:08,798 --> 00:00:09,633
AMBASSADOR, GOOD TO HAVE YOU

6
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:09,933
HERE.

7
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:13,136
>> THANK YOU.

8
00:00:13,136 --> 00:00:14,070
>> HERE WE ARE COMMENTS OF THE

9
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,071
SUMMIT BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP

10
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:15,805
AND KIM JONG-UN IS BACK ON FOR

11
00:00:15,805 --> 00:00:16,740
JUNE 12 IN SINGAPORE.

12
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,075
BASED ON THE COMMENTS THAT HE

13
00:00:19,075 --> 00:00:19,943
MADE TO SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT

14
00:00:19,943 --> 00:00:22,946
MOON, IN A SURPRISE MEETING

15
00:00:22,946 --> 00:00:24,548
SATURDAY, KIM JONG-UN REMAINS,

16
00:00:24,548 --> 00:00:30,854
HE SAYS HE REMAINS COMMITTED TO

17
00:00:30,854 --> 00:00:32,155
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION OF

18
00:00:32,155 --> 00:00:32,923
THE KOREAN PENINSULA.

19
00:00:32,923 --> 00:00:34,958
AND THE END OF THE KOREAN WAR.

20
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:36,059
CAN HE BE TRUSTED?

21
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,063
>> I THINK YOU JUST HAVE TO

22
00:00:40,063 --> 00:00:40,330
TRY.

23
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,097
AND THEN SEE WHETHER WE CAN

24
00:00:41,097 --> 00:00:41,765
COME UP WITH A DEAL THAT IS

25
00:00:41,765 --> 00:00:42,599
REAL AND VERIFIABLE AND

26
00:00:42,599 --> 00:00:42,999
IMPLEMENTED.

27
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:46,703
THE ALTERNATIVE IS NOT TO DO

28
00:00:46,703 --> 00:00:47,003
THAT.

29
00:00:47,003 --> 00:00:47,737
I THINK IT IS WORTH TRYING AND

30
00:00:47,737 --> 00:00:50,907
SEEING WHAT WE CAN DO.

31
00:00:50,907 --> 00:00:52,275
THIS IS ENCOURAGING STATEMENTS

32
00:00:52,275 --> 00:00:54,044
BUT OF COURSE, NORTH KOREA HAS

33
00:00:54,044 --> 00:00:54,644
POINTED OUT IT HAS BEEN

34
00:00:54,644 --> 00:00:57,147
ENCOURAGING IN THE PAST ONLY TO

35
00:00:57,147 --> 00:01:02,752
BACKTRACK SO LET'S SEE WHAT

36
00:01:02,752 --> 00:01:03,086
HAPPENS.

37
00:01:03,086 --> 00:01:04,254
>> PRESIDENT COME WHAT YOU

38
00:01:04,254 --> 00:01:05,422
THINK WOULD BE THE MOTIVATION

39
00:01:05,422 --> 00:01:06,089
TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE

40
00:01:06,089 --> 00:01:06,723
PROPOSED COMMITMENTS?

41
00:01:06,723 --> 00:01:09,993
>> A COUPLE OF THINGS.

42
00:01:09,993 --> 00:01:10,694
FIRST OFF, I THINK THE NORTH

43
00:01:10,694 --> 00:01:11,461
KOREAN ECONOMY AND SITUATION OF

44
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:12,796
THE COUNTRY ITSELF IS MUCH

45
00:01:12,796 --> 00:01:14,664
WEAKER THAN MANY OBSERVERS

46
00:01:14,664 --> 00:01:15,265
IMAGINED.

47
00:01:15,265 --> 00:01:16,299
THERE IS A SUSTAINABILITY

48
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:20,070
FACTOR FOR THE COUNTRY

49
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,470
INTERNALLY.

50
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,939
SECOND, WHAT WAS REFERENCED

51
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:23,607
ABOUT SECURITY GUARANTEES.

52
00:01:23,607 --> 00:01:25,709
THE IDENTITY WILL NOT BE AN

53
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:26,443
EXTERNAL EFFORT TO CHANGE THE

54
00:01:26,443 --> 00:01:26,776
REGIME.

55
00:01:26,776 --> 00:01:27,510
I THINK THOSE RESULTS ARE VERY

56
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,913
IMPORTANT TO HIM.

57
00:01:29,913 --> 00:01:30,814
THIRD, I THINK HE RELISHED THE

58
00:01:30,814 --> 00:01:33,083
SPOTLIGHT OF BEING THERE WITH

59
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:33,550
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

60
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,285
AND I THINK THE PRESIDENT TRUMP

61
00:01:35,285 --> 00:01:36,519
IS TRYING TO YOU THAT IN ORDER

62
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:38,455
TO SEE WHAT HE CAN GET IS A

63
00:01:38,455 --> 00:01:39,723
REAL COMMITMENT OR NOT.

64
00:01:39,723 --> 00:01:40,390
>> ALSO PERHAPS HIS LEGACY.

65
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,892
HE CAN BE THE ONE WHO CHANGES

66
00:01:42,892 --> 00:01:43,627
COURSE OF THINGS.

67
00:01:43,627 --> 00:01:45,362
WHEN HIS GRANDFATHER AND FATHER

68
00:01:45,362 --> 00:01:45,695
DID NOT.

69
00:01:45,695 --> 00:01:50,166
>> THAT IS AN OPTIMISTIC

70
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:50,500
NOTION.

71
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,269
I AGREE, PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT WE

72
00:01:52,269 --> 00:01:52,969
WOULD BE HISTORIC AND

73
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:53,503
SIGNIFICANT.

74
00:01:53,503 --> 00:01:54,971
WHO KNOWS!LET'S STAY FOCUSED

75
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:55,805
ON EXACTLY WHAT IT IS WE ARE

76
00:01:55,805 --> 00:01:58,775
TRYING TO AGREE ON AND SEE WHAT

77
00:01:58,775 --> 00:01:59,175
WE CAN DO.

78
00:01:59,175 --> 00:02:02,612
>> THAT IS STILL A LITTLE

79
00:02:02,612 --> 00:02:02,912
FUZZY.

80
00:02:02,912 --> 00:02:03,980
ALREADY, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

81
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,914
SAYING LISTEN, THERE COULD BE

82
00:02:04,914 --> 00:02:06,783
VARYING DEFINITIONS OF WHAT

83
00:02:06,783 --> 00:02:07,751
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION WOULD

84
00:02:07,751 --> 00:02:08,118
LOOK LIKE.

85
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:10,954
>> THAT IS TRUE.

86
00:02:10,954 --> 00:02:12,422
BUT I THINK IT IS VERY

87
00:02:12,422 --> 00:02:13,156
IMPORTANT THAT THE US HAS CLEAR

88
00:02:13,156 --> 00:02:13,657
GOALS IN HIS MIND.

89
00:02:13,657 --> 00:02:14,624
WE HAVE BEEN AT THIS A LONG

90
00:02:14,624 --> 00:02:15,058
TIME.

91
00:02:15,058 --> 00:02:17,594
NO WE CANNOT LIVE WITH NUCLEAR

92
00:02:17,594 --> 00:02:19,496
ARMED NORTH KOREA POINTING ITS

93
00:02:19,496 --> 00:02:20,196
WEAPONS AT THE UNITED STATES

94
00:02:20,196 --> 00:02:20,897
AND THREATENING ALLIES IN THE

95
00:02:20,897 --> 00:02:21,965
REGION AS WELL.

96
00:02:21,965 --> 00:02:24,434
WE KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO GET OUT

97
00:02:24,434 --> 00:02:24,768
OF THIS.

98
00:02:24,768 --> 00:02:25,402
IT IS WORTH TRYING TO SEE

99
00:02:25,402 --> 00:02:26,469
WHETHER WE CAN HAVE THE

100
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:27,103
MEETING, WE CAN CREATE A

101
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:27,504
DISCUSSION.

102
00:02:27,504 --> 00:02:37,380
THERE ARE WAYS TO PROVIDE AND

103
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:37,947
DO THAT.

104
00:02:37,947 --> 00:02:39,282
WE HAVE TO MEET AND UNDERSTAND

105
00:02:39,282 --> 00:02:40,383
THAT WE BELIEVE THAT IS WHAT

106
00:02:40,383 --> 00:02:42,952
DENUCLEARIZATION MEANS.

107
00:02:42,952 --> 00:02:43,853
>> DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA WHAT

108
00:02:43,853 --> 00:02:48,491
THAT MEANS IN TERMS OF WHAT WE

109
00:02:48,491 --> 00:02:49,159
BELIEVE?

110
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:49,859
>> I THINK IS BETTER TO LEAVE

111
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:51,061
THAT TO THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM.

112
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:51,795
I THINK THERE ARE SOME OPTIONS

113
00:02:51,795 --> 00:02:52,329
YOU CAN THINK ABOUT.

114
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:53,163
I DO NOT WANT TO PUT THAT OUT

115
00:02:53,163 --> 00:02:53,463
THERE.

116
00:02:53,463 --> 00:02:53,930
>> FAIR ENOUGH.

117
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,067
LISTEN, IF THE LEADERS OF KOREA

118
00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:57,667
ARE COOPERATING.

119
00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:00,603
CHINA HELPING THE US WITH

120
00:03:00,603 --> 00:03:01,538
PRESSURE ON PYONGYANG AND

121
00:03:01,538 --> 00:03:04,441
CIRCUMVENTING A TRADE WAR WITH

122
00:03:04,441 --> 00:03:05,675
THE US CADET IS EASING SOME OF

123
00:03:05,675 --> 00:03:06,409
THE STRAIN ON THE US CHINA

124
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:06,776
RELATIONS.

125
00:03:06,776 --> 00:03:11,181
WHAT ABOUT JAPAN?

126
00:03:11,181 --> 00:03:11,915
DON'T THEY HAVE A ROLE IN THE

127
00:03:11,915 --> 00:03:12,415
REGION?

128
00:03:12,415 --> 00:03:14,150
>> THEY CERTAINLY DO.

129
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,151
THERE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT

130
00:03:15,151 --> 00:03:18,288
NORTH KOREA'S MISSILE AND

131
00:03:18,288 --> 00:03:19,055
NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES.

132
00:03:19,055 --> 00:03:25,295
THEY ALSO HAVE A DIFFICULT BUT

133
00:03:25,295 --> 00:03:30,800
A RELATIONSHIP WITH NORTH

134
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,267
KOREA.

135
00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:32,502
AND THEY CAN BE A REGIONAL

136
00:03:32,502 --> 00:03:32,836
PLAYER.

137
00:03:32,836 --> 00:03:33,570
NORMALLY CHINA IS THE COUNTRY

138
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,471
THAT HAS THE MOST INFLUENCE ON

139
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:34,871
NORTH KOREA.

140
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:37,707
GETTING CHINA TO SUPPORT THE

141
00:03:37,707 --> 00:03:40,343
EFFORT AND CHINA NORTH KOREA

142
00:03:40,343 --> 00:03:40,844
PUTTING PRESSURE.

143
00:03:40,844 --> 00:03:41,878
>> THAT MEANS JAPAN RIGHT NOW

144
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:44,848
KIND OF STAYS --

145
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:47,717
>> PREPARED TO DEFEND ITSELF

146
00:03:47,717 --> 00:03:49,853
AND PREPARED TO JOIN THE

147
00:03:49,853 --> 00:03:50,520
POLITICAL PRESSURE ON NORTH

148
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:50,820
KOREA.

149
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,889
THE LEVERAGE ON NORTH KOREA IF

150
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:53,857
YOU WILL, TYPICALLY ECONOMICAL

151
00:03:53,857 --> 00:03:57,327
COME FROM CHINA.

152
00:03:57,327 --> 00:03:58,228
>> KURT VOLKER, AS EVERYONE IS

153
00:03:58,228 --> 00:03:59,562
WATCHING, THE WORLD IS

154
00:03:59,562 --> 00:03:59,929
WATCHING.

155
00:03:59,929 --> 00:04:02,165
WHAT IS THE IMPRESSION ON THE

156
00:04:02,165 --> 00:04:03,166
WORLD STAGE AS INTERNATIONAL

157
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,334
LAW ALLIES AND FOES WATCH ALL

158
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:07,036
OF THIS UNFOLD?

159
00:04:07,036 --> 00:04:11,207
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE HOLDING

160
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:11,641
THEIR BREATH.

161
00:04:11,641 --> 00:04:12,675
AS YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF

162
00:04:12,675 --> 00:04:13,610
SKEPTICISM ABOUT PRESIDENT

163
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,511
TRUMP AROUND THE WORLD.

164
00:04:14,511 --> 00:04:15,712
YET, HE IS MANAGED TO FLIP THIS

165
00:04:15,712 --> 00:04:19,281
FROM BEING TWEETS ABOUT "ROCKET

166
00:04:19,281 --> 00:04:21,151
MAN" TO BE NATURAL NEGOTIATION

167
00:04:21,151 --> 00:04:23,787
ABOUT DENUCLEARIZATION AND A

168
00:04:23,787 --> 00:04:24,287
POSSIBLE MEETING.

169
00:04:24,287 --> 00:04:26,456
PEOPLE ARE QUITE SURPRISED BY

170
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:26,956
THAT.

171
00:04:26,956 --> 00:04:27,924
OBVIOUSLY EVERYONE WANTS TO SEE

172
00:04:27,924 --> 00:04:29,092
THIS BE SUCCESSFUL.

173
00:04:29,092 --> 00:04:30,927
NOW YOU SEE PEOPLE HOLDING

174
00:04:30,927 --> 00:04:33,863
THEIR BREATH AND WAITING AND

175
00:04:33,863 --> 00:04:34,597
SEEING HOW THIS WILL PLAY OUT.

176
00:04:34,597 --> 00:04:38,301
>> IT DOES LOOK LIKE MOST WANT

177
00:04:38,301 --> 00:04:39,102
TO SEE THIS SUCCEED IN SOME

178
00:04:39,102 --> 00:04:40,403
SHAPE OR FORM.

179
00:04:40,403 --> 00:04:41,771
IS THERE ANYONE ON THE

180
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:42,939
INTERNATIONAL STAGE SORT OF

181
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:46,943
HIDING BEHIND THE NEGOTIATIONS

182
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:49,179
BETWEEN THE US AND NORTH KOREA

183
00:04:49,179 --> 00:04:50,013
TO HOPE THAT THEY ULTIMATELY

184
00:04:50,013 --> 00:04:50,580
WILL FAIL?

185
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,915
>> I THINK THERE'S A GREAT

186
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:54,951
DISTRACTION.

187
00:04:54,951 --> 00:04:56,853
MAYBE IRAN IS HOPING IT WILL BE

188
00:04:56,853 --> 00:04:57,220
PROLONGED.

189
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:57,821
APART FROM THAT, HE OF

190
00:04:57,821 --> 00:05:00,790
COUNTRIES IN THE REGION, CHINA,

191
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,691
EUROPEANS, UNITED STATES,

192
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:02,926
EVERYONE WOULD LIKE TO SEE

193
00:05:02,926 --> 00:05:04,093
