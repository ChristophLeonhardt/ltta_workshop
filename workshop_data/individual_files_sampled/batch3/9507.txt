THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN FOR KNIGHTS PROCEEDING DIFFERENTLY THAN PERHAPS ANY OTHER EVENT OF MAGNITUDE. ON BEHALF OF THE NATION, I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO BRAD AND THE ENTIRE A KAVANAUGH FAMILY FOR THE TERRIBLE PAIN AND SUFFERING YOU'VE BEEN FORCED TO ENDURE. THOSE WHO STEPPED FORWARD TO TO SERVE OUR COUNTRY DESERVE A FAIR AND DIGNIFIED EVALUATION. NOT A CAMPAIGN OF POLITICAL AND PERSONAL DESTRUCTION BASED ON LINES AND DECEPTION, WHAT HAPPENED TO THE KAVANAUGH FAMILY VIOLATES EVERY NOTION OF FAIRNESS, DECENCY AND DUE PROCESS. OUR COUNTRY, A MAN OR A WOMAN MUST ALWAYS BE PRESUMED INNOCENT UNLESS AND UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. AND WITH THAT, I MUST STATE THAT USE SIR UNDER HISTORIC SCRUTINY WERE PROVEN INNOCENT. MARGARET AND LIZA, MY FATHER IS A GREAT MAN. HE'S A MAN OF DECENCY, KINDNESS AND COURAGE WHO HAS DEVOTED HIS LIFE TO SERVING HIS FELLOW CITIZENS. AND NOW, FROM THE BENCH OF OUR NATION'S HIGHEST COURT, YOUR FATHER WILL DEFEND THE INTERNAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF ALL AMERICANS. WE ARE JOINED BY A LEADER WHO HAS NEVER WAVERED IN HIS SUPPORT AND DEVOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND TO BRETT KAVANAUGH'S ELEVATION. HE HAS WORKED VERY, VERY HARD AND HE TRULY HAS DONE AN INCREDIBLE AND WONDERFUL JOB FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. MAJORITY LEADER, MITCH McCONNELL. I THINK THAT'S THE BIGGEST HAND HE'S EVER RECEIVED. YOU ARE GREAT, THANK YOU. THE WIDESPREAD CHAIRMAN OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY. THANK YOU, CHUCK. WE ARE GRATEFUL TO ALL OF THE SENATORS ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WHO FOUGHT SO HARD FOR THIS CONFIRMATION. SENATORS LINDSEY GRAHAM, ORRIN HATCH, MIKE LEE, TED CRUZ, BEN SACHER, JEFF FLAKE, MIKE CRAPO, THOM TILLIS AND JOHN KENNEDY. THANK YOU ALSO TO ROB PORTMAN SITTING RIGHT HERE. FINALLY I AM INDEBTED TO SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS FOR HER BRAVE AND ELOQUENT SPEECH AND HER DECLARATION THAT WHEN PASSIONS ARE MOST INFLAMED, FAIRNESS IS MOST IN JEOPARDY. HOW TRUE, HOW TRUE. BRETT KAVANAUGH IS A MAN OF OUTSTANDING INTELLECT, A BRILLIANT SCHOLAR, AND HIS CREDENTIALS ARE UNSURPASSED. A GRADUATE OF BOTH YALE COLLEGE AND YALE LAW SCHOOL, HE HAS TAUGHT AT HARVARD AND DEAL GEORGETOWN. HE SPENT 26 YEARS IN PUBLIC SERVICE, AND HE CLERKED FOR JUSTICE KENNEDY. FOR THE LAST 12 YEARS, HE WAS A JUDGE ON THE D.C. CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS, WIDELY REGARDED AS OUR NATION'S SECOND HIGHEST COURT. DURING HIS TENURE HE AUTHORED OVER 300 OPINIONS DISTINGUISHED BY THEIR MASTERFUL AND IMPARTIAL REASONING. KNOWN AS A JUDGES JUDGE, HE IS A FAIR MINDED, UNBIASED AND EVENHANDED PERSON. HE UNDERSTANDS THAT JUSTICE MUST BE DIVORCED FROM THE PASSIONS OF THE DAY, TETHERED INSTEAD TO THE ENDURING FOUNDATION OF OUR REPUBLIC, THE CONSTITUTION. JUSTICE KAVANAUGH FILLS A PLACE LEFT BY ANTHONY KENNEDY. SOON JUSTICE KENNEDY WILL ADMINISTER THE JUDICIAL OATH TO BRETT KAVANAUGH JUST AS HE DID LAST YEAR FOR JUSTICE GORSUCH. THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE HAS EVER SWORN IN A FORMER CLERK TO TAKE HIS SEAT.
