1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:07,380
The surveillance footage is
remarkable in its banality.

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,010
It shows Stephen Paddock, 
the Las Vegas gunman,

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,490
in the days before 
his mass shooting.

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,140
He cuts a lonesome figure

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,360
as he moves through
the Mandalay Bay hotel —

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,290
playing video poker
for hours in the casino;

7
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,510
buying snacks at a newsstand;

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,610
watching a LeBron James 
interview in a restaurant;

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,340
and at times, chatting 
with hotel staff.

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,610
But this picture of an ordinary gambler

11
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,560
disguises a far more sinister intent.

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,310
Through this previously
unseen footage,

13
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,310
we’ll show how Paddock
methodically planned his attack,

14
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,730
and how, over seven days,
hotel staff unwittingly helped

15
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,630
him to move bag after bag
of weapons to his room.

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,080
The videos, obtained exclusively
by The New York Times

17
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,700
from MGM Resorts, begin
on Monday, Sept. 25.

18
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,190
At the V.I.P. counter,
he checks into a suite

19
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,960
on the 32nd floor, and
books an adjoining room,

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,830
which he will check into 
four days later.

21
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,920
He doesn’t immediately
bring in suitcases.

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,180
Instead, he spends
two hours in the hotel,

23
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,590
going to his room

24
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,820
and eating at a sushi
restaurant downstairs.

25
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,160
Just before 5 p.m.,

26
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,410
he drives his
Chrysler Pacifica minivan

27
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,410
to the valet area,
where a bellman loads

28
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:22,430
the luggage cart
with five suitcases.

29
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,736
Paddock asks to stay
with his luggage,

30
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,400
so the bellman brings him 
through the service elevators

31
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,710
to his room — something
hotel management

32
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,500
says is not unusual.

33
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,030
Paddock spends the next
four hours in his room,

34
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,750
and at 9:40 that night,
he leaves the hotel,

35
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,750
bringing two suitcases with him.

36
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,100
He drives one hour to
Mesquite, where he lived.

37
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,650
Cellphone records show
that he stays the night

38
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,890
and spends most 
of Tuesday here.

39
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,610
Around 8 p.m., Paddock
returns to Las Vegas,

40
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,430
but he stops at the Ogden,

41
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,430
a downtown
condominium complex.

42
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,010
This is interesting
for a few reasons.

43
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:05,430
Paddock was also renting rooms
here for the entire week.

44
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,380
He checked in the
previous Friday,

45
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,919
when a music event called
the Life Is Beautiful festival

46
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,780
was being held in
the surrounding streets.

47
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,030
Internet records recovered 
by the police show

48
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,980
that he searched for
that festival’s lineup

49
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,270
and its expected attendance.

50
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,280
This was similar to his research
of the Mandalay and the

51
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,420
Route 91 Harvest Festival,
which he would later attack.

52
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,550
So, the Ogden and 
the Life is Beautiful festival

53
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,490
could have been used for planning,
or may even have been a target.

54
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,010
Later Tuesday night, Paddock
returns to the Mandalay

55
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,970
and a different bellman
helps him to move

56
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,280
seven more suitcases
to his suite.

57
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,600
Again, he uses the
service elevator.

58
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,780
He tips the bellman,
who had no way of knowing

59
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,190
these cases were packed
with guns and ammunition.

60
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,540
He gambles for eight hours
until morning.

61
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,210
Paddock was a regular 
at the Mandalay,

62
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,500
and several casino
hosts knew him.

63
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,000
The videos show
their interactions

64
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,520
as being completely normal
and in no way alarming.

65
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,360
Remember, in two days,

66
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,300
Paddock has brought
12 cases upstairs.

67
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,630
He spends most of
Wednesday in his room,

68
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,380
and that evening repeats
a similar pattern.

69
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,090
He leaves the Mandalay,
again carrying two suitcases.

70
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,900
He stops at the Ogden and
drives home to Mesquite.

71
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,870
On Thursday, he buys a
.308 bolt-action rifle

72
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,720
from a gun store and
visits a nearby gun range

73
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,640
before driving back
to the Mandalay.

74
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,250
That night, he again 
uses the valet service

75
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,260
and a bellman to carry 
a white container

76
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,130
and three suitcases
to his room.

77
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,360
His arsenal of weapons 
is growing.

78
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,450
Again, he gambles
through the night.

79
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,170
It’s now Friday,
and at 8 p.m.,

80
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,280
the Route 91 Harvest
Festival will open

81
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,720
in the fairgrounds
across from the Mandalay.

82
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,080
Paddock stays in his room
until around 3 p.m.

83
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,020
and uses his laptop
while the suite is cleaned.

84
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,910
He checks into the
adjoining room, 134,

85
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:10,270
using the name of his
girlfriend, Marilou Danley.

86
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,030
He also tells cleaning staff

87
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,530
to leave behind 
the food-service cart.

88
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,180
Two days later,
Paddock would use this,

89
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,899
and one other service cart, 
to create a surveillance ring

90
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:22,480
during his attack.

91
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,280
Overnight, he makes a 
brief trip to Mesquite.

92
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,650
Arriving back at the
Mandalay at 6 a.m.

93
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,485
with two more suitcases.

94
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,420
Soon after noon on
Saturday, he places

95
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,890
do not disturb signs
on both room doors.

96
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,750
He declines housekeeping.

97
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,700
He takes an elevator
to the valet area

98
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,610
and sits, waiting for his car.

99
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,270
He carries two more
bags to his room.

100
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,140
He gambles some more,

101
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,290
and that night he makes
a final trip to Mesquite,

102
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:57,230
returning to the Mandalay
at 3 a.m. on Sunday morning.

103
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,660
He gambles
through the night

104
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,040
in the high-limits
slots area,

105
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,230
and returns to
his room at 7:37 a.m.

106
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,840
It’s 12:16 p.m. when
we see Paddock

107
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,250
going back to the
parking garage.

108
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,890
The guests exiting the
elevator have no idea

109
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,530
that in 10 hours, this
unremarkable figure

110
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,260
would commit the
worst mass shooting

111
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,570
in modern
American history.

112
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,680
He returns from his car,
bringing two suitcases

113
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,590
and a smaller bag inside.

114
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:31,260
Since Monday, he has
brought at least 21 cases,

115
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,590
two smaller bags, a laptop bag
and a container to his room.

116
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,620
This is the last time
we see Paddock,

117
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,510
arriving at the 32nd floor.

118
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,140
Through the day, 
he opens, closes and locks

119
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,900
both rooms repeatedly.

120
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,770
At thirty-six minutes after 9,
he locks the deadbolt

121
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,890
to room 135
for the last time.

122
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,420
Four minutes later,
Jason Aldean,

123
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,580
who’s headlining
the Route 91 festival,

124
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,780
begins his act.

125
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,540
Paddock then turns the 
deadbolt to room 134.

126
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:08,240
At 10:05, his shooting 
rampage begins.

127
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,020
In under 10 minutes, 
he would kill 58 people

128
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,230
and injure over 700, 
before taking his own life.

129
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,260
He had amassed
23 guns

130
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,190
and thousands of rounds
of ammunition.

131
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,180
Almost six months
since the attack,

132
00:06:22,180 --> 00:00:00,000
Paddock’s motive
remains unknown.
