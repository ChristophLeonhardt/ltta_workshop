THE FOX NEWS WAR ON THE WORKING
CLASS CONTINUES, AGAIN
TARGETING WAITERS.
THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING AGAINST
WAITERS THERE BUT THEY HAVE
A CEO ON FOX AND FRIENDS HE WAS
GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW
ENTITLED HIS SERVANTS HAVE
BECOME.
LET'S WATCH.
WHEN THE GOVERNMENT FORCES
YOU TO DO IT, WHAT HAPPENS?
THEY THINK YOU ARE GOING TO
PASS IT RIGHT ON TO THE
CONSUMER, BUT IF I TRY TO RAISE
PRICES, I AM DOING LESS GAS
AND THEY ARE GETTING INSULTED
AND THEY'RE NOT COMING.
THEY'RE NOT EDUCATED AND THEY
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS
HAPPENING.
IF THEY ARE COMING, NOBODY IS
GETTING PAID.
I DO LESS BUSINESS THEY HAVE TO
REACT SO I HAD BUS WAS BEFORE.
I CUT THEM TWO YEARS AGO WHEN
THE MINIMUM WAGE WENT FROM
5 TO 750 SO I USED TO HAVE A
CAPTAIN AND A BUS BOY, NOW
I ONLY HAVE A CAPTAIN AND
WAITER.
THEY TO DO MORE WORK, BUT
IT'S HARD TO FIND THE GOOD
PEOPLE, RIGHT?
AND INDUSTRY, YES.
TODAY IT IS ALWAYS HARDER.
THE WAY OF WEIGHT STOP IS
DIFFERENT DOUBT THEY USED
TO BE SERVANTS WHEN I FIRST
OPENED YEARS AGO, HE WAS A
GREAT PRIDE IN BEING A SERVANT.
TODAY THEY HAVE A MORE SENSE OF
ENTITLEMENT BUT I AM BUILDING
PEOPLE, YOUNGER PEOPLE JUST NEED
Ã± THEY'RE NOT USED TO WORKING.
THEY ARE STARTING LATER.
THEY ARE GOING TO SCHOOL AND
THEN THEY DON'T WANT A WORK.
THAT'S LESS THAN WE WANT OUR
IT'S TOUGH BECAUSE YOU
MEET SOMEONE WHO IS 23
YEARS OLD AND THEY NEVER REALLY
HAD A JOB.
MAN, BY THE TIME I WAS 23
I CAN'T SAY HOW MANY JOBS I
HAD INCLUDING AN FOOD-SERVICE SO
THAT WAS WONDERFUL, I WOULD
LIKE TO APPLAUD HIM FOR HIS
CHOICE OF WORDS.
THEY USED TO BE PROUD TO BE MY
SERVANTS BUT NOW THEY WANT
TO GO TO SCHOOL IN ASPIRE TO
SOMETHING ELSE.
I THOUGHT IT WAS HYPERBOLE
WHEN I FIRST SAW THE HEADLINE.
NO, HE LITERALLY SAID THEY USED
TO BE SERVANTS.
THAT IS A QUOTE.
NOW THEY ARE GOING TO SCHOOL AND
THEY DON'T WANT TO WORK.
NO, GOING TO SCHOOL SO THEY CAN
HAVE A BETTER JOB LATER SO
THEY DON'T SPEND THE REST OF
THEIR LIFE BEING YOUR
SERVANT AND HE IS LIKE WHAT KIND
OF WORK ETHIC IS THIS WHEN
YOU GO TO SCHOOL INSTEAD OF
WORKING FOR ME AND LOOK,
I'M FROM NEW JERSEY AND NEW YORK
AND NEW JERSEY ORIGINALLY
SO MAYBE A GLASS HOUSE AS THE
VIEWER SAID YESTERDAY MY
PRONUNCIATION OF BRICK IN BUT
THERE IS SOMETHING A NEWS
AMUSING WHEN THIS GUY SAYS THEY
ARE NOT EDUCATED ANYMORE.
OKAY, I ASSUME HE HAD SOME
EDUCATION AND HAS DONE WELL
IN HIS RESTAURANTS, BUT IF YOU
ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE
EDUCATED OR HAD THOUGHT IT
THROUGH A LITTLE BIT MORE,
YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO GO ON
NATIONAL TV CLAIMING ABOUT
COMPLAINING ABOUT YOUR SERVANT'S
DIET DOESN'T PLAY WELL.
IF YOU JUST TALK TO HEY, WHEN
YOU INCREASE THEM IN A
WAGE, IF ANYONE COULD MUSTER AN
INTELLIGENT ARGUMENT ON FOX
AND FRIENDS, THAT WOULD BE
AMAZING AND UNPRECEDENTED
BUT HE COULD'VE SAID LOOK, WHEN
YOU RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE,
THERE SOME CONSEQUENCES.
YES, ONE OF THEM, PEOPLE GET
PAID BETTER AND I'M HAPPY
ABOUT THAT.
AT LEAST HAD THE DECENCY TO LIE
ABOUT IT.
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I'M
UNHAPPY ABOUT IS THAT I
LOSE SOME OF MY BUSBOYS AND I
HAVE TO DO THAT CALCULATION
AND THAT IS TOUGH.
YOU COULD'VE MADE THAT
ARGUMENTATIVE COMING OUT THERE
AND GOING THE PROBLEM IS MY
CUSTOMERS, THEY ARE UNEDUCATED
AND MY SERVANTS, THEY HAVE A JOB
WITH ME AND THEY ARE GOING
TO WORK, THEN WORKING VERY HARD.
YOU SHOWED THE STAFF.
WE ARE NOT BEING PAID FOR HOW
HARD WE ARE WORKING AND
THAT IS ACROSS BASICALLY ALL
FIELDS IN THIS COUNTRY.
HE IS THE ENTITLED ONE.
HE THINKS BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT
HAVE AN EDUCATION AND NOT
LIVE ON THE STREETS THERE IS
SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEM.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT HIM.
I KNOW I WORKED AS A WAITER.
I KNOW PEOPLE WHO THEY ARE 50 OR
60 YEARS OLD AND STILL WORK
AS WAITERS THAT SOME PEOPLE
CHOOSE TO DO THAT BUT THE
IDEA THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE TO DO
THAT TAKE PERSONAL PRIDE IN
THAT NEVER ASPIRED ANYTHING ELSE
I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS AND I
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE
OF THE WHOLE ENTITLED THING,
THE SERVANT TALK BUT THEN JR DID
A LITTLE BIT OF DIGGING, SO I
DID SOME DIGGING ON THE SKY AND
FOUND THAT HE IS JUST INTERESTED
NOW BECAUSE OF THE MINIMUM WAGE
ALTHOUGH HE WAS IN 2015 TALKING
ABOUT HOW LABOR REGULATIONS ARE
SHUTTING DOWN RESTAURANTS
ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THIS IS A
GUY WHO WAS AN ACTIVIST ON THAT.
HE IS AN ANTI-LABOR ACTIVISM
IT IS WHAT HE DOES BUT JR
FOUND SOMETHING AND FROM
EARLIER IN HIS LIFE THAT MAY BE
INTERESTING AND MAY SPEAK TO HIS
WORK ETHIC.
HIS NAME IS WILLIAM JACK DEGEL.
HE DOES HAVE WORK AS A SNITCH.
I PERSONALLY THINK COOPERATING
WITH ONE FIRST MINUTES FIND
BETTER KNOW ABOUT HIS WORK ETHIC
BECAUSE HE WANTED TO STILL
MONEY BY COMMITTING FRAUD.
WEIRD.
AND THEN YOU SEE THAT GUY AND
YOU SEE HIS ATTITUDE
TOWARDS HIS WORKERS, YOU SEE THE
FACT THAT HE IS COMMITTED
FRAUD IN THE PAST AND ANY THINK
ABOUT A RECENT CHANGE TO
THE LAW AND THE TAX BILL WHERE
DONALD TRUMP IS MAKING IT
SO THAT TIPS ARE THE LEGAL
PROPERTY OF MANAGERS AND
OWNERS OF RESTAURANTS AND WE
HAVE TO JUST HOPE THAT IN
THEIR BENEFITS SINCE THEY WILL
ACTUALLY PASS ON THE TIPS
TO THE PEOPLE WHO WORKED AND
EARNED THEN, REGULAR AMERICANS.
ARE YOU GOING TO TRUST THAT
GUIDING HAND OUT THE TIPS?
I WOULD NOT.
LET'S KNOW FOR THE RECORD, HE
SAID THE PROBLEM WITH THE YOUNG
IS THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO WORK
HARD GOT TO BE FAIR TO HIM, HE
WAS RELATIVELY YOUNG AT THE AGE
OF 27 WHEN HE DID NOT WANT TO
WORK HARD AND WANTED TO DO
CREDIT CARD FRAUD INSTEAD.
THE ANNOYING PART OF THIS WHOLE
STORY IS WEIRD NOT GOING
HAVE TO CHANGE THE SAYING FROM
SNITCHES GET
STITCHES TO SNITCHES GET
RESTAURANTS.
