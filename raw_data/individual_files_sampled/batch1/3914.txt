are you ready to give up of the notion of two-state solution that was adopted by previous administration so I'm looking at two state and one state and I like the one that both parties like I'm very happy with the one that both parties like I can live with either one I thought for a while the two-state looked like it may be the easier of the two but honestly if Bibi and if the Palestinians if Israel and the Palestinians are are happy I'm happy with the one they like the best as far as the embassy moving to Jerusalem I'd love to see that happen we're looking at it very very strongly we're looking at it with great care great care believe me and we'll see what happens okay
