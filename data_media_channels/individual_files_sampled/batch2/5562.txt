the president says this was leaked I don't understand who exactly would have leaked this and I'm not saying tell us the sources because you wouldn't know but Tom's complaining it was leaked robert Muller's team never leaks anything making us wonder could it be President Trump's own team what do you think it's like three kids Stephanie and one of the kids has ice cream frosting all has cupcake frosting all over their face you have a good idea which kid ate the cupcake we know that nobody leaks from the special counsel's office and all of a sudden Rudolph Giuliani's involved and the leaks began it clearly is from the president's legal team this information these questions that have been put out there and again we see the president this morning tweeting tweeting dishonestly making all sorts of disparagement Slyke he did in Michigan attacking the special counsel attacking the intelligence community attacking the Justice Department denigrating the institutions that keep the country safe and so at the end of the day what we know to be true is this on every single instance going back to the inauguration and even to the transition every time that someone in this administration has been asked a question about Russian involvement about meetings with Russians any question involving a Russian somebody in that administration is lied about it and I suspect that's the case with the president's tweets this morning you know the president I always want to remind us always says no collusion I've yet to hear him talk about no money-laundering Daniel what do you make of Muller strategy here when you were in your last position would you have given the questions to the person who you want to sit down and talk to I'm very surprised that he laid out the questions in this much detail to the president maybe he didn't well it would be odd for this extensive list of questions that are so consistent with the reporting that we've heard and are so consistent with what we know for this not to be tethered to discussions that the president had with with Muller I suppose you're right and in some sort of conspiracy see theory world the president could have made up all these questions and then leaked them but my guess is it is from conversations no no what I mean is the president or the president's lawyers might not have gotten 49 actual questions maybe they got the lay out of all this and if Muller is laying out here's our themes would he be laying this out and asking these questions if he didn't already know the answers no he certainly has evidence I'm not sure he knows the answers conclusively but he has evidence related to all of these questions the the interesting thing as you pointed out stuff is that in my 10 years I never ever provided questions to a witness before I interviewed them as a prosecutor that's just not something that you do you could talk about topics and so what this reads to me is that he's being quite favorable and deferential to the president who's obviously a special witness so to speak because he's the president United States and it really debunks the whole theory that the President and others have tried to parry that this is an effort to lure the president and to trap him into lying this reads to me as if Muller is being incredibly transparent about what he's trying to do and where he's trying to go and he's giving the president every benefit of the doubt in order to try to wrap this up to get the president's input on the investigation which is I think a critical component to Muller's role as special counsel even if it is not in the ordinary course that you would see if that's the case Steve Schmidt put your GOP hat on for a moment if what Dan is saying is that Muller is making it clear he's not trying to trap the president he's laying out exactly what he has and everything he's trying to figure out we know that the president might send out disparaging tweets that attack these institutions because it works for his core base if he wants to blow this investigation up but if you are Republicans sitting in office who have no previous ties to Trump and no ties to Russia and you see where Muller is in this investigation does it not give you pause to say hold on a second Muller really is flying straight things aren't going off the rails well too late at the end of the day Republicans have tied themselves to the mast with Donald Trump and they're going to go down on the ship with him when you look at the special elections that have taken place over the course of the last year including in districts that Donald Trump won by 17 18 points a district that he is a 22 point Republican district that the Republican just narrowly defeated the Democratic candidate and you have 35 retirees in the House of Representatives what that says is Republican members of Congress are saying that we don't want to be in the minority we're likely to be in the minority we think we're going to lose and we're getting out but the Republican Party you know 80% of it supports this president he has consumed the Republican Party the Republican Party that I was a part of involved in the bush White House the John McCain campaigns the party of Ronald Reagan that party's gone it's dead this is the party of Donald Trump today and so so the Republican Party is the party of trumpism and in the election in November the American people will have their first opportunity to deliver a referendum on trumpism whether they like it or whether they don't and at the end of the day the the evidence suggests that they don't like it very much and that there'll be a massive repudiation in November I hear you I just wonder does that Republican Party that 80% that stands with Trump can they continue to blow off this investigation and say it's no biggie when they see these questions knowing what what Danny's point that Muller knows the answers without needing Trump to answer them does it start to make them say hold on a second we need to pay closer attention and can one question I'm paying closer attention to I was in the New York Times where they say quote what knowledge did you have of any outreach by your campaign including Paul Manafort to Russia about potential assistance to the campaign I hadn't heard anything like that previously about metaphor and Russia is this new it is new Stephanie when I started digesting these questions last night the first the first question I wanted to answer for myself is what can we learn from this about Muller's investigation what in here has not been made public and the answer is almost nothing except the information suggested in that question and we don't know for sure but it's certainly worded in a way that suggests that Mulder has developed information that man afforded perhaps other members of the campaign we're reaching out to the Russians talking about assistance in coordination there's been no evidence of that so far we have evidence that the Russians reached out to George papadopolis and said hey we have these leaked and hacked emails but not not the other way and that's really interesting because you know to Dan's point why would Muller present the questions to a putative defendant my sense of this is the answer is because these are crushingly obvious questions these are not questions that would surprise anyone who's been following this and therefore every one of these questions there are 12 detailed follow-ups socked with evidence emails phone intercepts classified intelligence designed to pin Donald Trump down to either force a damaging admission or catch him in a lie that's what we're not seeing here we're also not seeing anything about potential bank fraud or money laundering or Deutsche Bank subpoenas anything they may have in the president's personal business so there's a lot we're not seeing most of these questions are incredibly obvious except that one that you pointed out about Paul Manafort it's really intriguing to learn what is behind that sentence last point in well to the point about Manta Ford remember Rick Gates cooperated a couple months ago and Rick Gates was Manta Ford's right right-hand man for years and years so you have to assume Rick Gates has given every piece of information he knows about Manta for about his dealings on the campaign to Muller and Rick Gates went to the what long after Manta fort had left the team Rick Gates was hanging around the White House all right we got to go yes or no boys one at a time Steve Schmidt does Donald Trump end up answering questions and sitting down with mother yes or no no Ken no absolutely not Dan no Wow well there we have it no across the board hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube
