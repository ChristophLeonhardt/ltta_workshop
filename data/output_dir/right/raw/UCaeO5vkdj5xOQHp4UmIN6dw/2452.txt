your questions all right the weekend we

had Captain America Civil War I I really

liked it and i<font color="#CCCCCC"> also thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i also have</font>

86
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,250
something to say about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it which is</font>

87
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,510
different than anything i've read<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

88
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,860
actually had an observation about this

89
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,690
film that it was different<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the</font>

90
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,850
stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reading about and i</font>

91
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,930
will talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that but first we have</font>

92
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,519
to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real civil war in the</font>

93
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,440
Republican Party which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

94
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,840
because Trump is now trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> gather</font>

95
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,760
people around him while being the most

96
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,600
divisive<font color="#E5E5E5"> and annoying part exist three</font>

97
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,200
so he starts out with Paul Ryan came out

98
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,760
last week and<font color="#CCCCCC"> said he wasn't ready to</font>

99
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">endorse Donald Trump and and those two</font>

100
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,650
words<font color="#E5E5E5"> not ready I'm not ready have been</font>

101
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,079
repeated over and over again so I wanted

102
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:39,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">to play an extended clip to give you the</font>

103
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:41,579
full sense of what he was saying was

104
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:43,410
talking to jake tapper at CNN and tapper

105
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,269
said are you going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> endorse him and</font>

106
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:48,150
here is ryan's full response to be

107
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,829
perfectly candid with you Jake I'm just

108
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,350
not ready to do that at<font color="#CCCCCC"> this point I'm</font>

109
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,079
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> there right now and i hope to though</font>

110
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:57,269
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to but i think what is</font>

111
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:00,150
required is that we unify this party and

112
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,470
I think the bulk of the burden on

113
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,540
unifying the party will have to come

114
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">from our presumptive nominee I don't</font>

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,829
want to underplay what he accomplished

116
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:09,780
he needs to be congratulated for an

117
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,090
enormous accomplishment for winning not

118
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,769
now a plurality of Delegates and he's on

119
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:14,940
his way to winning a majority of

120
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,370
Delegates but he also inherit something

121
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,709
very special that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very special</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

122
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:22,019
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us this is the party of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lincoln</font>

123
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,870
of Reagan of Jack Kemp and we don't

124
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">always nominate a Lincoln and oregano</font>

125
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,940
for years but we hope that our nominee

126
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,010
I'm aspires to be Lincoln and Reagan

127
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,310
asked but that person<font color="#CCCCCC"> um advances</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

128
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,730
principles of our party and appeals to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

129
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,760
wide vast majority of Americans and so I

130
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,770
think what is necessary to make this

131
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">work to for this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to unify is to actually</font>

132
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,990
take our principles and advance them and

133
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,930
that's what we want to see saying we're

134
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,000
unified doesn't in and of itself unify

135
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,610
us but actually taking the principles

136
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,470
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> believe in showing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

137
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,730
there's a dedication of those and

138
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,110
running a<font color="#CCCCCC"> principle campaign that</font>

139
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,060
Republicans can be proud<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and that</font>

140
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">can actually appeal to a majority of</font>

141
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,900
Americans that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me is what it takes to</font>

142
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,360
unify this<font color="#E5E5E5"> parties so just to unpack</font>

143
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,770
that a little bit i mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a it's a</font>

144
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,390
very measured statement he's not

145
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,610
withholding his endorsement but he's

146
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,890
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> very firm and saying that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he wants</font>

147
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,300
a candidate who act just a little bit

148
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">more like Reagan the Lincoln and maybe a</font>

149
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,840
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit less</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like pee-wee Herman he's</font>

150
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,140
just a little little dignity dignity in

151
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">the in the party but it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a very firm</font>

152
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,450
steadfast statement and remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

153
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,000
Paul Ryan is going to be the chairman of

154
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,220
the Republican convention which is

155
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,730
supposed to be a uncommitted neutral

156
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,430
position so Trump is still only<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

157
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,020
presumptive nominee everyone else has

158

dropped out but I think many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

159
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,800
like casting spells and praying that

160
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone will be descend from the ceiling</font>

161
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,730
and take it away from him somehow so so

162
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,900
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was being very measured and of</font>

163
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,790
course Trump shot back with well he's

164
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">not ready to support me I'm not ready to</font>

165
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,710
support look at a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 year old you know</font>

166
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,510
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> back on him and he also</font>

167
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,400
threatened to try and block him from

168
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,170
serving<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the chairman of the</font>

169
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,190
convention which i think is interesting

170
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,300
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think he has any power</font>

171
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,130
to do that but he can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

172
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,630
noise about it so they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to meet</font>

173
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,810
on Thursday and they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font>

174
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,820
conversation even<font color="#E5E5E5"> worse than Trump's</font>

175
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,100
reaction because Trump has has held back

176
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,930
he said he was blindsided by this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he</font>

177
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,790
was surprised by it and he has held back

178
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,430
on going the full Trump on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ryan so far</font>

179
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,120
but Sarah Palin<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean you know in the</font>

180
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,670
same way that Donald Trump seems to me

181
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:34,110
to be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Liberals attacks on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us come to</font>

182
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,120
life all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nasty things that liberals</font>

183
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,800
have said about us over the years that

184
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,180
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been saying no no that's not true</font>

185
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:39,710
it's not

186
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,970
true we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that at all suddenly</font>

187
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,590
it was like they all congealed and

188
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,140
became Donald Trump ok we heard I was

189
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,620
like oh you're a person maybe we are her

190
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,570
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little like that maybe some of us are</font>

191
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,880
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know Sarah Palin has now</font>

192
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,670
become what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who attacked her</font>

193
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,160
said she was you know and I mean and

194
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,260
this is not a promising this personally

195
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,530
I'm saying as a political figure she has

196
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,810
now become this screechie crazy extreme

197
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,400
person who and she went to how she

198
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,790
responded to Paul<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ryan same I think Paul</font>

199
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:17,270
Ryan is soon to be cantered as an eric

200
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,630
cantor his political career is over but

201
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,640
for a miracle because he is so

202
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,550
disrespected the will of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people and</font>

203
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:30,020
yeah as the the leader of the GOP the

204
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">convention certainly he is to remain</font>

205
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,360
neutral<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for him to already come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

206
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,210
and say who he will not support was not

207
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,000
a wise decision of his you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

208
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">white Paul Ryan is doing this Jake is it</font>

209
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:48,200
kind of screws his chances for the 2020

210
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,660
presidential bid that he's gunning for

211
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,470
if the GOP were to win now that wouldn't

212
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,170
bode well for his chances in 2020 and

213
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,180
that's what he's shooting for so a lot

214
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,970
of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their never Trump or not</font>

215
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,580
right now Trump mantra going on they

216
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,680
have their different reasons I think

217
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">that one is Paul Ryan's reason yeah Paul</font>

218
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,750
Ryan is afraid that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if Trump wins he</font>

219
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,370
won't be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run in 2020s either</font>

220
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or he thinks the Trump as a clown</font>

221
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,810
is reptile I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> it one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of those what</font>

222
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">are the other you know you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

223
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,790
absurd I mean it's absurd first of all

224
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,470
he didn't say he wouldn't support Trump

225
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,330
he said he wasn't ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> support from</font>

226
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,420
that is the most childish<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's complete</font>

227
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,030
crap I mean it's completely complete

228
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,919
nonsense<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this idea that he's going to</font>

229
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">be cantered you know we got rid of Eric</font>

230
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">Cantor well I'm not even sure getting</font>

231
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,960
rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Eric Cantor was such a good idea</font>

232
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,190
and it's so it's so weird how the<font color="#E5E5E5"> far</font>

233
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">right purity test that we've all been</font>

234
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,890
yelling<font color="#E5E5E5"> at people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guy's a traitor</font>

235
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,600
and Paul Ryan's a traitor man this

236
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,250
always really bugged me because

237
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,960
I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought Paul Ryan is a really</font>

238
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,670
good thoughtful conservative I think

239
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,260
he's a man of<font color="#CCCCCC"> integrity I think he's</font>

240
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,810
been trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do some I don't think he</font>

241
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,010
necessarily was a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good vice</font>

242
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:04,610
presidential candidate for for various

243
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,290
reasons that have really nothing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

244
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,610
with his personality I'd have to do with

245
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,700
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that the people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

246
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,890
opposed to his reform of the entitlement

247
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,990
system votes we need it so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not sure</font>

248
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">that he he wasn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better off serving us</font>

249
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,520
better in the house but but he's

250
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously a man of principle he's taken</font>

251
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,480
a principled stand he's gonna meet<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

252
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,280
Trump on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the twelfth which is thursday i</font>

253
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,170
think and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i imagine what he's going</font>

254
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,060
to say to trump is he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say hey</font>

255
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,970
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need a statement from you</font>

256
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,130
telling us that you are going to stick

257
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,750
to something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks vaguely like</font>

258
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,600
republican principles and what Trump is

259
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,760
going to say is I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got all these votes</font>

260
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,620
millions of millions of votes frankly

261
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,390
you know that frankly they'd I mean I

262
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">won New York by everybody you've been</font>

263
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,050
new york voted for me the entire state

264
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,250
you know he won all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these states that</font>

265
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,200
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> democrats are going to win all the</font>

266
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,580
states the<font color="#E5E5E5"> trump one of the states that</font>

267
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,930
the democrats are gonna win in the

268
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,760
general election so that doesn't mean

269
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,560
all that much but he says he<font color="#CCCCCC"> says New</font>

270
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,089
York's and play it might be we don't

271
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:00,470
know so Trump is going to go and say I

272
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,140
am<font color="#E5E5E5"> the will of the people and it's what</font>

273
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,170
I say now is the is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Republican</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Party</font>

274
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,220
so that's the conversation they're gonna

275
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,960
have and Trump basically said this he

276
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,730
was talking to George Stephanopoulos and

277
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,980
he basically said it's it's not a

278
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,320
conservative party whose<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wheaton</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

279
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,360
it's a mistake not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this we want to</font>

280
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,280
bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> the party together does the party</font>

281
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,870
have to be together does it have to be

282
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,339
unified I'm very different<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

283
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:24,170
everybody else perhaps it's ever run for

284
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,810
office I actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think so i think</font>

285
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,430
that doesn't have to know i don't think

286
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">so i think it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would be better if it were</font>

287
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,330
unified<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it would be there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

288
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,160
be something good about it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

289
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,140
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it actually has to be unified into</font>

290
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,330
traditional said<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to do what I</font>

291
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,310
have to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have millions of people</font>

292
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,110
that voted<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me because I have strong</font>

293
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,970
borders because I want strong trade I

294
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,310
want good trade I want trade I don't

295
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,380
want to be an isolationist but what's

296
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,000
happening with China what's happening

297
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,070
with Japan what's happening with Mexico

298
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,080
they're just absolutely eating our lunch

299
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,720
it's a shame it's terrible so I have to

300
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,210
stay true<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my principles also and I'm</font>

301
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:00,980
a conservative but don't forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

302
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,420
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Republican Party it's now</font>

303
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,680
called the Conservative Party you know

304
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,640
there are conservative

305
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,520
parties it's called the Republican Party

306
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,680
but you know it obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trump knows</font>

307
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,970
where the opposition's coming from it's

308
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:11,930
coming from us is coming from the

309
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">Conservatives and this is I think a kind</font>

310
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,900
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is kind of interesting if there</font>

311
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,270
are any honest people on the Left paying

312
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,620
attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you read the New York</font>

313
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,510
Times the New Times of skewing the news

314
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,980
this is Donald Trump's party there were

315
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,780
always trump there now Trump and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

316
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,280
Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump you know

317
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,350
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> New York Times point of view</font>

318
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,810
but if any honest leftist is paying

319
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,760
attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> he must be saying to himself</font>

320
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">huh maybe they weren't all Trump I mean</font>

321
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,090
the fact that people are standing up

322
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,670
against Trump is might might be telling

323
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,350
to an honest left winger who suddenly

324
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,670
looking at this and saying gee I thought

325
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is who they were that suddenly</font>

326
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,600
there are voices opposing what I want to

327
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,730
know though is what can he say the Paul

328
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,660
Ryan that Paul Ryan can believe what

329
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,370
words could come out of Donald Trump's

330
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,890
mouth where Ryan could say oh now I'm

331
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,560
reassured I mean if Ryan is looking for

332
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,810
a fig leaf if he's looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a way of</font>

333
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,700
saying to the public well he<font color="#E5E5E5"> told me</font>

334
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,530
this kind of what what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sean Hannity has</font>

335
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,360
been doing Sean Hannity you know Trump

336
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,340
goes on and babbles and sean hannity

337
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,990
says so you believe it's a matter for

338
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,600
the states and you know Trump goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

339
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever and an entity says well he said</font>

340
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,380
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a matter for the states and go</font>

341
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,110
like wait wait I'm sorry I lost I'm

342
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,660
totally lost now so you know if that's

343
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">what Ryan is looking for if he's looking</font>

344
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">for a fig leaf that's all he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

345
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,420
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> because everything the Trump says is</font>

346
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,510
up for grabs I mean he did say you know

347
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,160
that he was against the hike in the

348
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,330
minimum wage now he's going around

349
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know how can anybody</font>

350
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,860
live on 725 which is the federal<font color="#CCCCCC"> minimum</font>

351
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,550
wage first of all 29 states have higher

352
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,170
minimum wages that's the first thing I

353
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:45,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">think two percent of full-time workers</font>

354
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,020
get minimum wage two percent of people

355
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,720
with a job and it is that's not a lot of

356
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">money i mean 725 an hour is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a lot of</font>

357
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,540
course it depends where you live but

358
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,980
it's still it is nowhere where it's a

359
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,620
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of money but raising the minimum</font>

360
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,470
wage destroys those jobs so it's not

361
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,810
like you go from getting 725 an hour to

362
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,820
getting 15 you go from 725<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of</font>

363
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,770
getting zip you're getting you know he's

364
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,570
sitting at home and collecting the dole

365
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,610
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what that's the problem that</font>

366
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,950
economists and conservatives have with

367
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,270
the minimum<font color="#E5E5E5"> wage does not mean pneus</font>

368
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,620
it's not like you know you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> deserve</font>

369
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,050
more money it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

370
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,060
it's what the market will bear so he

371
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,279
changed on that he posted his own tax

372
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:25,459
plan which I cool huh he had this tax

373
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:27,620
plan that cut everybody's taxes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

374
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,390
it cuts everybody taxes and suddenly

375
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,070
says well you know the rich should pay

376
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,750
more I'm a rich person and I'm willing

377
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,760
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay more which an argument I always</font>

378
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,170
loved because it doesn't really mean

379
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,579
that the rich person is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay</font>

380
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:38,870
more what it means is the middle class

381
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,130
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because Richard never</font>

382
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,230
pay more they rich the guys who<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

383
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,660
billions of dollars don't pay more taxes

384
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,279
that's not going to happen so if he

385
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:47,870
wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay more taxes there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">website the Treasury you know their</font>

00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,180
says sticks you know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an</font>

390
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,620
article today in the New<font color="#E5E5E5"> York Times by a</font>

391
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,560
philosophy professor and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy said</font>

392
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this is part of his power is the</font>

393
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:06,110
fact that he<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't care if he</font>

394
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:09,170
completely contradicts himself that when

395
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,910
he countered<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when he says well I</font>

396
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:15,320
can't really you know deny or disrespect

397
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,300
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ku Klux Klan and then he says oh</font>

yeah I completely reject the Ku Klux

399
00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:21,980
Klan that people hear what they want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

400
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,100
hear they the guys who like the clan say

401
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,140
well he had to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that second thing you</font>

402
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,459
know and the guys who want to be

403
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:30,230
reassured<font color="#E5E5E5"> say well he changed his mind</font>

404
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,120
you know so if he says completely

405
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,880
opposite things it actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> helps him</font>

406

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not held to the same standard</font>

407
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,630
as other candidates and the other thing

408
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,820
the guy said was that it makes people

00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,920
daily wire and that's by the way another

462
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,080
great reason to subscribe if you want to

463
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,180
be where the principled conservatives

464
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,290
are and where the principal

465
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,120
conservatives are thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

466
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,430
how we're going to handle this

467
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,870
disastrous situation this is the place

468
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,190
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be because this is the place because</font>

469
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:46,550
we are we are not we are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in debt to</font>

470
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,230
anybody we are going to tell you exactly

471
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">what we think every step of the way both</font>

472
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,710
me and then we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> both we're and</font>

473
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,330
everyone who writes here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

474
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,400
what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to say nobody is telling us</font>

475
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,040
what to say and we will we will take the

476
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,110
principal option every time again so

477
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,340
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one thing you know it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

478
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,080
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> when Reagan lost afford when he</font>

479
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,780
lost the nomination to Ford he quoted a

480
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,180
famous ballad which goes kind of like a

481
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,940
knight who's been hurt in battle says I

482
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,760
am wounded sire but I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> NOT slain I</font>

483
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,099
will lay me down to bleed a while then

484
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,810
rise to fight again and that's kind of

485
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,099
what that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Shapiro's up and that's</font>

486
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:20,300
what we're going to do and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

487
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,400
part of the logic beyond this was it

488
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,810
Ross do thought wrote in The New York

489
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,369
Times this morning part of the reason

490
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:28,220
for doing that is that even a successful

491
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,830
trump presidency a trump presidency that

492
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,450
people like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you know where</font>

493
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:35,270
maybe the economy recovered he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

494
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">to destroy conservatives it's going to</font>

495
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,610
destroy the Reagan coalition I mean in

496
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:43,580
the same way that a successful Clinton

497
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,480
presidency was bad for

498
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,160
services it was good for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the country in</font>

499
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,270
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways because he did</font>

500
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,130
conservative things but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it made people</font>

501
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,410
think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the Democrat Party is</font>

502
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,090
rejecting everything that Clinton did

503
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,100
because it was conservative so it made

504
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,590
people think that it wasn't conservative

505
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,970
made them think oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the way</font>

506
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,309
Democrats behave which is nonsense you

507
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:04,620
know so a trump presidency here's here's

508
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,540
Ross do thought he says in a fully Trump

509
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,990
eyes GOP<font color="#E5E5E5"> Reagan's ideological coalition</font>

510
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,660
would crack up<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hawks would drift toward</font>

511
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,880
the Democrats supply siders would fade

512
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,130
into cranker<font color="#CCCCCC"> II religious conservatives</font>

513
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,500
would enter a semi permanent exile and

514
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,049
in its place a trump pised<font color="#E5E5E5"> Republican</font>

515
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:23,880
intelligentsia would arise with as

516
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,010
little interest in Reaganism as today's

517
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,540
conservatives have and the ideas of

518
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,669
Nelson Rockefeller or jacob javits

519
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:32,820
famous famously liberal<font color="#CCCCCC"> Republicans the</font>

520
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,440
things conservatives are telling

521
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,510
themselves to justify supporting Trump

522
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,400
at least he might appoint good judges

523
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,600
for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's one of the things</font>

524
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,400
that people are saying to justify their

525
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,169
support for Trump they miss the long

526
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:45,630
term point the Reagan coalition might

527
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,429
get an acceptable<font color="#CCCCCC"> Supreme Court</font>

528
00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:48,960
appointment out of the trump presidency

529
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,360
it might but that could easily be the

530
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,900
last thing it ever got so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we jump</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

531
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,880
the Trump train and another<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing by the</font>

532
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,440
way that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is if we jump on</font>

533
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the chump Trump train Trump just by</font>

534
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,470
virtue of his reptilian personality

535
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,870
soils us it's very hard for us to go

536
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to responsible reasonable people in</font>

537
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,580
the center<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say try our ideas once</font>

538
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,380
we've attached ourselves to a guy like

539
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,260
Trump now the others principal point of

540
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,910
view is was in the Wall Street Journal

541
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,860
today from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bobby Jindal the governor</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

542
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,730
Louisiana basically he said it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

543
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,380
famous I'm holding my<font color="#E5E5E5"> nose you know he's</font>

544
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,830
basically Jindal has attacked Trump in

545
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,929
no uncertain terms I mean he has called

546
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:32,730
him every name<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the book but today he</font>

547
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:33,929
wrote this op-ed in the Wall Street

548
00:19:33,929 --> 00:19:36,480
Journal he said I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> electing Donald</font>

549
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,760
Trump would be the second worst thing we

550
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,770
could do this November better only than

551
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lectin Hillary Clinton to serve as the</font>

552
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,220
third term for the Obama

553
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,679
administration's radical policies I am

554
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:48,540
not pretending that mr. Trump has

555
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,340
suddenly become a conservative champion

556
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,830
or even a reliable Republican he is

557
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely unpredictable the problem is</font>

558
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,690
that Hillary<font color="#CCCCCC"> is predictably liberal so</font>

559
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:58,419
that is the

560
00:19:58,419 --> 00:19:59,889
their point of view and those are two

561
00:19:59,889 --> 00:20:01,659
principal points of views I respect them

562
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:05,200
you know I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think as conservatives</font>

563
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,059
as conservatives rebuilding our movement

564
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:08,169
because no matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> what happens</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

565
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:09,429
gonna have to rebuild our movement I

566
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:12,159
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we should be issuing purity</font>

567
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,159
tests I mean men have consciences I

568
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:16,570
think even women of conscience<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

569
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:19,149
doing cleansing<font color="#E5E5E5"> No</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry upset I</font>

570
00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:21,730
misspoke but I know but men and women

571
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:24,009
have consciences any living breathing

572
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:26,529
conservative movement has got to respect

573
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:28,570
the consciences of principle men and

574
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,609
women it's got to or else we're just

575
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:32,980
we're just the kind of ideologues we

576
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,869
become Barack Obama of the right which

577
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:36,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">is not what we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do we want to say</font>

578
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,440
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we allow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people to change their</font>

579
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,350
mind I mean this guy but the one thing I

580
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:44,980
cannot respect I<font color="#E5E5E5"> cannot bring myself to</font>

581
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,470
respect is the enthusiastic love and

582
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,720
support for this creepiness bully I mean

583
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,480
the man is a creek no he's what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jews</font>

584
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,730
have an expression a Shonda to the goyim

585
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,859
it means he shames us before the

586
00:20:56,859 --> 00:20:59,679
Gentiles and I think that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem</font>

587
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,629
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy with link you know with</font>

588
00:21:01,629 --> 00:21:04,600
attaching ourselves to a guy who behaves

589
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,580
in this manner let alone his lies let

590
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,539
alone the fact that we don't know what

591
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:09,399
he stands for let<font color="#E5E5E5"> alone the fact that he</font>

592
00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:12,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">has no sense of constitutional limits on</font>

593
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">his authority aside from that his</font>

594
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,200
behavior is<font color="#E5E5E5"> so bad that it shames the</font>

595
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,269
movement all right but<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to the other</font>

596
00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:22,269
civil war among the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Avengers which is</font>

597
00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:24,009
far more serious because they have all

598
00:21:24,009 --> 00:21:25,570
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> powers and they tear things up</font>

599
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,669
maybe so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see this movie i</font>

600
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:29,230
found a delightful<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you know i'm not</font>

601
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,419
i'm not a big superhero movie I in fact

602
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:33,669
I've kind of been a state away from them

603
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:35,470
for the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple years so I this this</font>

604
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,019
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the story that is it's called</font>

605
00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:39,340
captain america but it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

606
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">Avengers movie so this is part of the</font>

607
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:43,960
Winter Soldier vengers of age of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ultron</font>

608
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,239
series so it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a series part</font>

609
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:47,950
of that story but I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow it and</font>

610
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,359
there was no problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was not like</font>

611
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:51,399
Batman<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Superman and by the way</font>

612
00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:53,080
there'll be no spoilers in this I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

613
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,600
going to spoil<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything in the movie</font>

614
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,909
however the one thing I noticed<font color="#E5E5E5"> was that</font>

615
00:21:57,909 --> 00:22:00,580
the plot to this movie was exactly the

616
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,789
same plot as Batman vs Superman which

617
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:06,399
was a terrible<font color="#CCCCCC"> movie is it vs Superman</font>

618
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:07,970
to Superman vs Batman I Kenny

619
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:10,700
remember but it's exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same plot</font>

620
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:15,710
they they gin up this moral gray area

621
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,870
which wouldn't in real life be immoral

622
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,330
rare which in that saving in saving the

623
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:25,100
world the superheroes commit collateral

624
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,260
damage and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are now upset</font>

625
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,210
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> their vigilantes play just a little</font>

626
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:30,620
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the trailer so they can see the</font>

627
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:34,460
idea well a great many people see you as

628
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,880
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hero there are some would prefer the</font>

629
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,150
word vigilant you've operated with

630
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:44,200
unlimited power and no supervision

631
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,790
that's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world can no longer</font>

632
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:52,540
tolerate I know how much is here

633
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:56,050
stare to this one please

634
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,960
you only make us worse you saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll</font>

635
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,380
arrest me

636
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:07,230
big consequences captain you seem a

637
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:10,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">little defensive has been a long day if</font>

638
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,330
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can accept limitations we're no</font>

639
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:16,340
better new bad guys that's not the last

640
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,030
something want to punch you in your

641
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:21,720
perfect teeth<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so in both</font>

642
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,600
Batman<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Superman and and in this</font>

643
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,140
Civil War the authorities want to have

644
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,690
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of governments over these</font>

645
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:33,420
superheroes so in batman vs. superman is

646
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,160
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> american government</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this it's the</font>

647
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,370
international government and there's a

648
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,600
disagreement and this is all in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

649
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,920
trailer<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I'm not giving anything away</font>

650
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,620
iron man takes one side he says yes we

651
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,880
should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> governed by the United Nations</font>

652
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,400
and Captain America says no you know we

653
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,070
know bet we don't have to serve the

654
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:53,070
agenda<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the people in in government of</font>

655
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,930
the people in the UN and that's where

656
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:58,110
the the team becomes divided what's

657
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">really fascinating about this is it</font>

658
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,990
fascinating first of all the two immense

659
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,880
superhero movies have the same one from

660
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,770
the DC Universe one from the more<font color="#E5E5E5"> Marvel</font>

661
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:07,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">Universe have exactly the same plots and</font>

662
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,270
I think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason for that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is they are</font>

663
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,800
reacting to something whether they know

664
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,300
it or not I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whether they know</font>

665
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,100
it or not they're reacting to our role

666
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,260
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> war on terror they're reacting to</font>

667
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,880
the fact that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously in the</font>

668
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,310
right in fighting Islamic terrorism and

669
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,950
we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into these countries like Iraq and</font>

670
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,960
we cause collateral damage people die

671
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,240
not just the bad guys but<font color="#E5E5E5"> children than</font>

672
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,070
women and people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> innocents get</font>

673
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:32,310
killed in these wars and should the

674
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,110
reason Batman vs Superman is such a bad

675
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,880
movie for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's bad for a million reasons</font>

676
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,920
but one is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the American</font>

677
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,330
government who wants control over

678
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,190
Superman which makes a lot more sense

679
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,870
than the United<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nations taken control of</font>

680
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:45,060
Captain America he is America so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

681
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">question that they're raising is are we</font>

682
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,370
now to be governed by the united nations

683
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:53,520
are we now an international<font color="#E5E5E5"> enterprise</font>

684
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,470
instead of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> government and that's</font>

685
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:58,380
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> the argument that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is taking</font>

686
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">place in this election it is exactly the</font>

687
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,480
and it comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the same place it</font>

688
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,610
comes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> our reaction i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's an</font>

689
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:08,190
unconscious reaction to our movement

690
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:11,040
overseas to battle to dislodge the

691
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,470
government in Iraq to fight the forces

692
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,420
of Islamic extremism a lot of people

693
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">Trump really included or saying why are</font>

694
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:18,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">we the ones</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over there if I let them</font>

695
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,060
kill each other<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do we care we know</font>

696
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,350
they come over<font color="#CCCCCC"> here but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe we should</font>

697
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,150
just pull back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and protect ourselves why</font>

698
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,470
should we be fighting why should our

699
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,180
guys be dying over there and so that's

700
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,010
the question that's going that's being

701
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:29,789
answered

702
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:32,190
have you know and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have the</font>

703
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,799
same thing happening in our election on

704
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,179
the one hand you have Donald Trump

705
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:38,580

706
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,830
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to we're going to have trade</font>

707
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,409
wars with our trading partners if

708
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:44,940
anybody tries<font color="#CCCCCC"> to leave the country if</font>

709
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,229
any business tries to leave the country

710
00:25:46,229 --> 00:25:47,729
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to tariffs him into the</font>

711
00:25:47,729 --> 00:25:49,889
ground we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to protect America</font>

712
00:25:49,889 --> 00:25:53,190
first and then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have John Kerry right</font>

713
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:56,369

714
00:25:56,369 --> 00:25:58,830

00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:01,379
at i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> was Northwestern University</font>

716
00:26:01,379 --> 00:26:02,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm not sure he gave a commencement</font>

717
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,279
address in which he said kids get ready

718
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a borderless wall world there's</font>

719
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be a borderless world we're not</font>

720
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to let Donald Trump build any</font>

721
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,109
walls there's going to be a borderless

722
00:26:13,109 --> 00:26:15,299
world so John Kerry will call him

723
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:18,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">ironhead man and on the other side we</font>

724
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:19,679
have Donald Trump will call him captain

725
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,809
america first right happy let's battle

726
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:24,090
over who<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to control are we</font>

727
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,340
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> become an international a</font>

728
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,729
global government and I think the thing

729
00:26:29,729 --> 00:26:33,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">is both these guys Trump and Carrie I</font>

730

732
00:26:36,989 --> 00:26:39,149
the guy just a Deadhead I think he's a

733
00:26:39,149 --> 00:26:41,039
knucklehead you know i do not think this

<font color="#E5E5E5">is an intelligent very intelligent man</font>

735
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,700
and obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think Trump is a</font>

736
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,470
very intelligent man but the argument

737
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,960
there having is real the borders are

738
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,899
falling away the walls are falling away

739
00:26:51,899 --> 00:26:54,299
we have to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> business with the world we</font>

740
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:55,499
have to do business with the world so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

741
00:26:55,499 --> 00:26:56,909
can have all the neat stuff that we like

742
00:26:56,909 --> 00:26:58,320
nobody's going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of the stuff</font>

743
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,269
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we like the iphones that don't cost</font>

744
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:02,940
a two thousand dollars which because

745
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,440
part of them are made overseas or

746
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,139
cashews which they you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you can't</font>

747
00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:09,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">get here you know all the things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

the world rich are coming from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

750
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,409
global economy and as you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a global</font>

751
00:27:16,409 --> 00:27:18,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">economy you're going to move toward</font>

752
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,700
global governance trade follows the

753
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">flack but but to simply say because the</font>

754
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,309
world is becoming global we have to

755
00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:29,549
surrender our ideals and our ideas which

756
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:31,799
is basically the<font color="#CCCCCC"> obama doctrine it's</font>

757
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,629
like you know we're not exceptional

758
00:27:33,629 --> 00:27:35,909
we're not special we are special we are

759
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:38,159
special we are the spearhead of a

760
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,899
righteous idea and that idea is not

761
00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:42,059
fairness its fairness before the law and

762
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:43,890
liberty those are the idea

763
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,020
you know in Germany they are now telling

764
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,060
women they have to dress differently to

765
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,380
accommodate the immigrants who are

766
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,150
molesting them<font color="#E5E5E5"> there tell their they're</font>

767
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:54,030
even thinking of banning sexy women on

768
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,700
commercials so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the Muslims will not</font>

769
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,100
be offended and I guess moved excited

770
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,190
and moved to and move to attack women

771
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,410
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sign of a nation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that has</font>

772
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,510
lost the sense of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it's about not</font>

773
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,860
that women shouldn't be modest I would

774
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,480
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see women be a little bit more</font>

775
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,530
modest that has nothing to do with it

776
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's their choice it's their decision</font>

777
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,710
how they dress what they look like how

778
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,240
they present themselves it's not ours

779
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,800
and it's not it's certainly not the

00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">right of thugs these Islamic thugs to</font>

781
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,720

we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to build a wall</font>

784
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,450
because when these people come in

785
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:30,090
they'll simply take over and transform

786
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:32,700
the country if we say to people yeah you

787
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,260
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> come in but you've got to become us</font>

788
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,820
you can deal with us but you've got to

789
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">deal fairly you've got to deal with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:40,440
the law<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we can have less more</font>

00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,840
of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> global world but that global world</font>

792
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,850
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to look like us and that it's</font>

795
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,160
to be free there's not going to be any

796
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,750
killing people when they convert it

797
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,460
ain't going to happen until we can make

798
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,140
that strong statement if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

799
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,840
that's Imperial tough it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter</font>

800
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then it's the it's the imperialism</font>

801
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,370
of good ideas the imperialism of good

802
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,900
ideas we have to stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that and</font>

803
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,340
that's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the answer because</font>

804
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,570
otherwise we're all going to wind up

805
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:09,000
like Iron Man and Captain America<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

806
