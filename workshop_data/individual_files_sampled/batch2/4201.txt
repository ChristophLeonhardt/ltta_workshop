michael steele join us in listening to the Senate Majority Leader McConnell on the subject of african-american outreach with African Americans we haven't been able to make much headway although I think it is noteworthy that Tim Scott is a member of our conference and he's the arguably the most popular politician South Carolina so there's hope with african-american voters as well blacks to one of the US cities in our caucus so I guess that was what that's what it comes down to that's outreach we got one yeah we have meetings with them I'm sorry it just it just reminds me of so many conversations I had when I was chairman and and and trying to move this party and to turn this elephant elephant to understand that that's not how it works yeah it took a lot I can tell you the backstory on Tim Scott when he was running for Congress there weren't a whole lot of people in this town that were backing that campaign and pushing his candidacy in South Carolina I remember standing it in feet in a field with headlights on the door rally for him when I was telling my you know my national tour to sell to gin up the base and get folks to turn out there weren't a whole lot of people out there you know supporting that candidate in that campaign but you got a lofty goal of changing the face we had a lofty goal of changing the face of party and you do it one candidate at a time you do it one neighbor at a time you don't you don't make an offhand reference oh well we got Tim Scott well you had JC Watts to and what did you do with him you know you bumped him out of leadership you know you so don't don't play this game and think that we're sitting back stupid and going oh yeah that makes a lot of sense to me too it doesn't and that is why it has been so difficult and so hard to turn the page on this and you can sit back inside oh well you know blacks a conservative you know the Voting Rights that and civil rights that we were there but you know we live in a world in which we asked one question what have you done for me lately and with the civil rights with the Voting Rights Act sitting in the in the in the desk drawer of the Speaker of the House that says all you need to know about the relationship between the party in the black community in 2018 Eli Stoker's that repetition of phrases you hear on the road that begin in that office is the latest this talk of a mob yeah I mean and it's not that new we've been hearing it for a week ever since protesters were drawn to Capitol Hill during the the Kavanagh confirmation fight the president Republicans now they're all singing from the same sheet of music and they have videos out there talking about protesters and really trying to brand all this stuff as a mob you know hearing the president refer to Democrats as an angry mob inside an arena where he's sort of revving up his own based and people are shouting traitor at the top of their lungs they're chanting lock their lock him lock her up about Dianne Feinstein and Hillary Clinton it's just sort of you have to step back sometimes it can sound a little bit like the president is projecting but I have talked to people inside the White House political shop and they believe wholeheartedly that the way to animate this base is to get them angry and so whatever it takes the Cavanagh thing touched a nerve and they are trying to hold on to the anger that they were able to stoke about the way Kavanaugh was in their view treated during his hearings they're trying to sustain that anger over the last three and a half weeks of this election because they know that the Democratic voters they've been angry for the better part of two years and they're going to turn out Republicans are really just trying to keep their voters riled up and hope to to stanch some of the bleeding that they're expecting in November hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
