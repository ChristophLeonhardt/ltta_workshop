THIS. 

6
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:14,681
A FAIR AMOUNT 

7
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:15,982
OF THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS HERE IN 

8
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:16,282
WASHINGTON. 

9
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:17,517
WE FORGET THAT THEY ARE ALWAYS 

10
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,518
INVITED TO THESE SUCH EVENTS. 

11
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,953
HE IS ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE IN 

12
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,621
THAT ROTUNDA WHOM I HAVE KNOWN 

13
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:24,124
ALL OF THEM BY NAME. 

14
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:24,657
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

15
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:25,759
A GREAT ADVOCATE FOR AMERICAN 

16
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:26,493
DIPLOMACY AS WELL.

WE HEAR THE SILENCE THAT IS SO 

23
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:39,038
POWERFUL BUT TELL US WHAT YOU 

24
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:40,006
ARE SEEING. 

25
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,575
>> Reporter: THE SILENCE ITSELF 

26
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:43,510
IS SO POWERFUL, I AM SEEING 

27
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,178
FAMILY MEMBERS GET IN THE THREE 

28
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:48,781
VANS THAT ARE POSITIONED IN THE 

29
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:50,416

OUT ONTO CONSTITUTION AVENUE 

31
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:54,320
WHERE PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY 

32
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,855
GATHERED TO PAY THEIR LAST 

33
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:56,122
RESPECTS. 

34
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:58,324
I SAW MEGAN McCAIN WHO WE HAVE 

35
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:02,128
ALL SEEN HAS BEEN EXTREMELY 

36
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:03,029
EMOTIONAL THROUGH THIS. 

37
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:04,631
WHEN I COVERED THE McCAIN 

38
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:07,467
CAMPAIGN BACK IN 2008 SHE WAS 

39
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,636
THERE CONSTANTLY. 

40
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:12,238
SHE WAS ALWAYS BY HER FATHER'S 

41
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:12,972
SIDE. 

42
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:14,107
CINDY McCAIN, SENATOR. 

43
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:18,244
McCAIN'S WIFE,  ALSO GOT INTO 

44
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:18,645

00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:19,646
YESTERDAY THERE WERE ABOUT 21 

46
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:20,880
MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY, NOT 

47
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,584
WHITE AS MANY THIS TIME. 

48
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,752
I DON'T THINK THERE WERE ANY 

49
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,586
GRANDCHILDREN, HE HAS FIVE 

50
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:27,220

CHILDREN AS YOU NO. 

52
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:30,757
LOTS OF SPOUSES. 

53
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,292
A BROTHER AND A SISTER AND HIS 

54
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,260
106-YEAR-OLD MOTHER, ROBERTA, 

55
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,764
WHO IS LISTED IN THE PRESS 

56
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:38,798
GUIDE IS 106 YEARS YOUNG. 

57
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,366
THAT IS VERY MUCH A STATEMENT 

58
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,435
OF FACT. 

59
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,670
I DID NOT SEE HERE, I'M NOT 

60
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:49,342
SURE IF ANY OF YOU DID, THEY 

61
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:50,543
ARE WAITING FOR THE HEARSE TO 

62
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:51,377
BEGIN MOVING BEHIND THE POLICE 

63
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:52,679
ESCORT AND THEN HAD OUT ONTO 

64
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:53,279
CONSTITUTION AVENUE. 

65
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,714
THIS IS THE FINAL GOODBYE TO 

66
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:55,815
JOHN McCAIN FROM THE PLACE THAT 

67
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:57,183
HE LOVED SO MUCH. 

68
00:01:57,183 --> 00:02:01,521
>> AND ED, I NO YOU HAVE BEEN 

69
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,022
DOING SOME REPORTING AROUND 

70
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:03,222
THIS. 

71
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:06,426
ROBERTA McCAIN REALLY CAPTURED 

72
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:07,226
SO MUCH ATTENTION YESTERDAY 

73
00:02:07,226 --> 00:02:10,663
BECAUSE SHE APPEARED SO STOIC. 

74
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:11,497
>> ABSOLUTELY, AND REALLY 

75
00:02:11,497 --> 00:02:12,498
GRIPPING THE HAND OF MEGAN 

76
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:14,934
McCAIN THROUGH MOST OF THAT 

77
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:15,234
CEREMONY. 

78
00:02:15,234 --> 00:02:16,569
I WAS TOLD BY SOMEONE CLOSE TO 

79
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:17,637
THE FAMILY THAT AFTERWARD SHE 

80
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,838
ACTUALLY GAVE A PEP TALK AND 

81
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,106
TOLD EVERYONE IN THE FAMILY AND 

82
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:21,975
SOME OTHER FRIENDS, DON'T BE 

83
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:27,080
GLUM, DON'T BE DOWNTRODDEN, HE 

84
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,114
HAD A GREAT LIFE. 

85
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:29,215
THE FAMILY HAS GREAT FAITH AND 

86
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:30,817
THEY ARE GOING TO BE STRONG TO 

87
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,586
ALL OF THIS. 

88
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:34,754
SHE LIVES HERE IN WASHINGTON, 

89
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:35,955
WHICH IS WHY SHE WAS NOT IN 

90
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:36,889
ARIZONA EARLIER IN THE WEEK. 

91
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:38,691
IT WAS QUITE A SIGHT TO SEE 

92
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:39,125
YESTERDAY. 

93
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,326
YOU THINK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE 

94
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,160
ICONIC IN AMERICAN HISTORY AND 

95
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,195
YOU THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE 

96
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:42,562
BEHIND THEM. 

97
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,363
SHE IS A WOMAN, MOTHER OF A 

98
00:02:44,363 --> 00:02:46,733
SENATOR, DAUGHTER-IN-LAW OF AN 

99
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:47,734
ADMIRAL, WIFE OF AN ADMIRAL, 

100
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,168
SOMEONE WHO PLAYED A CRITICAL 

101
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:51,237
ROLE IN PROPPING UP REALLY 

102
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:52,405
IMPORTANT PEOPLE. 

103
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:53,906
>> AND WE THINK OF HIM BEING 

104
00:02:53,906 --> 00:02:56,509
THE SON OF AN ADMIRAL AND THE 

105
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:01,614
GRANT SEVEN OF -- GRANDSON OF 

106
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:03,049
AN INTEGRAL, BUT HE WAS REALLY 

107
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:05,418
A MAMA'S BOY, YOU CAN HEAR HIM 

108
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:08,154
TELL IT, SHE WAS A GREAT 

109
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:10,990
INFLUENE IN HIS LIFE. 

110
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,793
AND SOMETIMES AT THE SENATE HE 

111
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:19,398
WOULD SAY DO YOU NO WHAT SHE 

112
00:03:19,398 --> 00:03:20,133
DID THIS MORNING? 

113
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,367
IT WAS REALLY FUN TO TALK TO 

114
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,802
HIM ABOUT IT, HE LOVED HER TO 

115
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:23,102
DEATH. 

116
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:24,170
>> ON THIS DAY OF SUMMER 

117
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,073
REMEMBRANCE IT IS IMPORTANT THAT

118
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:32,212
WE REMEMBER, HE WAS ALWAYS 

119
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,112
STOPPING AND TELLING A STORY 

120
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,547
OUT OF THE SIDE OF HIS MOUTH, 

121
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,548
THAT SPARK THAT FIRE, THAT 

122
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:39,819
ENERGY, THAT COMES FROM WITHIN. 

123
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,286
>> HE WAS NOTHING IF NOT 

124
00:03:41,286 --> 00:03:46,159
IRREVERENT. 

125
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,560
HE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN A KICK OUT 

126
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,195
OF THIS IF THEY WERE GOING TO 

127
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:49,896
RENAME THE RUSSELL BUILDING. 

128
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,030
WHEN I CAME TO WASHINGTON THOSE 

129
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,032
BUILDINGS DIDN'T HAVE A NAME, 

130
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,167
THEY WERE THE NEW SENATE OFFICE 

131
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,301
BUILDING AND RUSSELL WAS THE 

132
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,202
OLD ONE AND McCAIN ALWAYS 

133
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:57,203
POINTED OUT, HE ALWAYS CALLED 

134
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:59,272
IT THE OLD SOP. 

135
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,841
>> AND GOOGLE EVEN ALREADY 

136
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,042
RENAMED IT. 

137
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:06,212
IF YOU PULL UP YOUR GOOGLE MAP 

138
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:07,447
IN WASHINGTON DC, IT IS RENAMED 

139
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:10,283
TO THE McCAIN SENATE BUILDING. 

140
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,617
>> THERE WAS A MAKESHIFT 

141
00:04:11,617 --> 00:04:13,686
MEMORIAL THIS WEEK, PEOPLE HAD 

142
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:17,023
JUST COME TO THE EDGE OF THE 

143
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:17,957
RUSSELL SENATE OFFICE BUILDING 

144
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,058
TO LEAVE FLOWERS AND NOTES AND 

145
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,492
LETTERS IN REMEMBRANCE OF THE 

146
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:21,293
SENATOR. 

147
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:22,528
>> THERE IS SOME DEBATE OVER 

148
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:23,896
EXACTLY HOW TO HONOR SENATOR. 

149
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:28,601
McCAIN,  I NO JOHN YOU WERE 

150
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,836
TALKING TO HIS DEAR FRIEND 

151
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,137
LINDSEY GRAHAM THIS WEEK ABOUT 

152
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:32,038
JUST THAT. 

153
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,239
HE SAID HE WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE 

154
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:34,474
TO SEE SOME LEGISLATION RESULT 

155
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:35,575
FROM THIS MOMENT. 

156
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:36,476
>> HE SUGGESTED MAYBE 

157
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,509
IMMIGRATION REFORM MIGHT BE 

158
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:42,482
SOMETHING, WE WERE TALKING 

159
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:43,483
ABOUT McCAIN BEING AT THE HEART 

160
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,817
OF EVERY FIGHT AND THAT WAS ONE 

161
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:45,651
OF THEM, IMMIGRATION REFORM. 

162
00:04:45,651 --> 00:04:48,121
>> A FIGHT HE NEVER QUITE ONE. 

163
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,522
>> JUST LIKE HE DIDN'T WIN THE 

164
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,858
TOBACCO FIGHT, JUST LIKE HIS 

165
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:52,491
FIGHT FOR CAMPAIGN-FINANCE 

166
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:53,793
REFORM WAS HOLLOWED OUT BY THE 

167
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,528
COURTS, A LOT OF THOSE FIGHTS 

168
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:58,064
ARE FIGHTS THAT HE TRIED AND 

169
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:06,439
EITHER HE WON THEM OR HAD A LOT 

170
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,774
OF PUSHBACK AND WAS UNABLE TO 

171
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:07,974
WIN. 

172
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,075
BUT LINDSAY SAID HE WANTED TO 

173
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,977
NAME THE VISITOR CENTER AT THE 

174
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,380
CAPITAL BECAUSE ONE, IT WOULD 

175
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,681
BE WHERE ALL VISITORS TO THE 

176
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:16,516
CAPITAL WOULD SEE AND THEY 

177
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:17,717
WOULD LEARN ABOUT THE LIFE OF 

178
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:18,951
JOHN McCAIN, BUT ALSO IN 

179
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:19,752
KEEPING WITH THE IRREVERENCE 

180
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:20,586
THAT BOB TALKED ABOUT, JOHN 

181
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,021
McCAIN DIDN'T LIKE, THE FIRST 

182
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,022
TIME I REPORTED ABOUT HIM IT 

183
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,257
WAS ABOUT BUDGET MATTERS, HE 

184
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,258
DIDN'T LIKE OVERSPENDING AND HE 

185
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:28,027
DIDN'T LIKE THE CAPITAL VISITOR 

186
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:28,528
CENTER AT ALL. 

187
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:29,729
LINDSAY THOUGHT NAMING IT AFTER 

188
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:30,763
HIM WOULD BE THE NICE FINAL 

189
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,632
LITTLE RIBBING TO HIM. 

190
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:33,399
BECAUSE HE HATED THE 

191
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,334
EXPENDITURE OF THE PEOPLE'S 

192
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,335
MONEY ON THAT VISITOR CENTER. 

193
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,203
>> [ LAUGHTER ] A 

194
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,838
SENSE OF HUMOR THERE AS WE 

195
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:43,743
WATCH THE MOTORCADE PROCEED, WE 

196
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,144
NOTE THAT THE SENATOR HAD SPENT 

197
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,913
A GREAT DEAL OF TIME OVER THE 

198
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,615
PAST YEAR, THAT HE HAS BEEN 

199
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:50,316
BATTLING, 13 MONTHS EXACTLY 

200
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,851
THAT HE HAS BEEN BATTLING BRAIN 

201
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,820
CANCER, TO THINK ABOUT HOW HE 

202
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,488
WANTED TO SPEND THIS FINAL TRIP 

203
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:59,392
THROUGH WASHINGTON, AND WHAT HE 

204
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,960
WANTED TO PAY HOMAGE TO WITH 

205
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,627
HIS LIFE. 

206
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,863
I THINK IT IS VERY SIGNIFICANT, 

207
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:07,533
A DECISION ON HIS PART TO GO 

208
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,335
FROM THE CAPITAL TO THE VIETNAM 

209
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:09,869
WAR MEMORIAL. 

210
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,169
BEFORE HE GOES ON TO THE 

211
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:12,939
CATHEDRAL. 

212
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,540
NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE HISTORY 

213
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,744
HE HAS, 5 1/2 YEARS AS A 

214
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:18,878
PRISONER OF WAR IN VIETNAM. 

215
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,112
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT HIS 

216
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:22,114
MOTHER. 

217
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:23,516
I NO IN SOME OF HIS OWN 

218
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:24,951
WRITINGS ABOUT HIS PARENTS HE 

219
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:31,090
SAID AT FIRST HIS MOM DID NOT 

220
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,392
THINK HE HAD SURVIVED BEING 

221
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,626
SHOT DOWN AND IT WAS HIS FATHER 

222
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:34,861
WHO SAID NO, HE SURVIVED. 

223
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,062
BUT CAN YOU IMAGINE AS A PARENT 

224
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,531
THROUGH ALL OF THAT, KNOWING 

225
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:43,069
THAT YOUR CHILD -- 

226
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,271
>> SHE ALWAYS SAID NAVY TOUGH. 

227
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,640
AND SHE CERTAINLY WAS. 

228
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:56,149
>> WE KNOW THE MOTORCADE IS 

229
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,250

COME OUT LATE IN THE EVENING AS 

294
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,194
THE SUN WAS SETTING, AND HE 

295
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,796
DESCRIBED THE LOCATION AS A 

296
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:53,299
PLACE OF HEALING. 

297
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,700
BUT HE DID ADMIT THAT IT TOOK 

298
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,135
HIM A WHILE TO COME AROUND. 

299
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:57,303
AT FIRST HE DESCRIBED THINKING 

300
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,071
THE DESIGN WAS A LITTLE BLEAK 

301
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:02,074
BUT THEN HE WOULD TELL A STORY 

302
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,709
ABOUT COMING OUT HERE ONE 

303
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,011
MORNING AND LOOKING ON AND 

304
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,446
SEEING A COUPLE OF VETERANS WHO 

305
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:08,881
CLEARLY DID NOT SEEM TO NO AGE 

306
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,049
OTHER BUT STRUCK UP A 

307
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,851
CONVERSATION AND HE SORT OF 

308
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,487
LOOKED ON AS THEY TALKED A 

309
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:15,021
LITTLE BIT. 

310
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:19,058
HE CAME TO QUICKLY REALIZE THAT 

311
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,393
THEY SERVED AT THE SAME TIME IN 

312
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,861
THE SAME LOCATION IN VIETNAM. 

313
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,597
THEY EMBRACED AND BEFORE THE 

314
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:25,698
END OF THE CONVERSATION THEY 

315
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:26,932
WERE EMOTIONAL AND EMBRACING. 

316
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:30,636
AND CENTER -- CENTER -- 

317
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:30,903
SENATOR. 

318
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:31,837
McCAIN DESCRIBED THAT THIS WAS 

319
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:32,838
THE MOMENT HE REALIZED  THIS 

320
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,607
PLACE WAS EVERYTHING THEY HOPED 

321
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:38,244
IT WOULD BE. 

322
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,945
IT WAS A PLACE OF HEALING AND A 

323
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:40,579
PLACE OF RECONCILIATION. 

324
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:41,580
THIS MORNING IT IS A PLACE 

325
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,215
WHERE AS WE SAID A FEW HUNDRED 

326
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,650
FOLKS ARE OUT HERE WAITING FOR 

327
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,285
THE FAMILY SO THEY CAN LOOK ON 

328
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,653
AND PAY THEIR RESPECTS AND SAY 

329
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:48,120
THEIR FAREWELLS. 

330
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,555
>> AND WE ARE LOOKING AT SOME 

331
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:52,591
OF THE PHOTOS THAT WERE RELEASED

332
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:53,993
OF HIS 5 1/2 YEARS IN 

333
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:54,960
CAPTIVITY. 

334
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,463
3 1/2 YEARS IN SOLITARY 

335
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:00,966
CONFINEENT DURING THAT TIME. 

336
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:03,102
AT WHAT IS REFERRED TO AS THE 

337
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,937
HANOI HILTON. 

338
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:05,971
AS A PRISONER OF WAR. 

339
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:07,373
I NO BOB YOU COVERED THE WAR 

340
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:12,278
FIRST-HAND AND SO MUCH OF THE 

341
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:12,912
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE WAR HAS 

342
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:13,679
CHANGED IN THIS COUNTRY. 

343
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:18,851
AND JOHN McCAIN PLAYED A VERY 

344
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:19,985
BIG ROLE IN DOING THAT, IN 

345
00:10:19,985 --> 00:10:21,220
ENDING THE WAR ABOUT THE WAR. 

346
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,855
>> HE PLAYED AN ENORMOUS ROLE 

347
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:23,122
IN THAT. 

348
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:30,362
HE WAS AS YOU ALL NO, -- KNOW, 

349
00:10:30,362 --> 00:10:32,264
WAS VERY IMPORTANT AND PLAYED A 

350
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:33,933
KEY ROLE IN GETTING THE REMAINS 

351
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,034
OF MANY OF THE MISSING BACK 

352
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:35,668
INTO THIS COUNTRY. 

353
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:38,104
AND OF WORSE JOHN McCAIN WENT 

354
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,473
TO VIETNAM AND ASKED, AND FOR 

355
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,742
GAVE HIS CAPTORS. 

356
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:43,742
THE PEOPLE WHO HAD TORTURED 

357
00:10:43,742 --> 00:10:43,942
HIM. 

358
00:10:43,942 --> 00:10:45,945
BECAUSE OF THAT IT SPEEDED UP 

359
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,581
OUR ABILITY TO REESTABLISH 

360
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:54,319
RELATIONS WITH VIETNAM. 

361
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:55,755
WE WOULD HAVE DONE IT, IT WOULD 

362
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:56,956
HAVE TAKEN TIME, BUT HE SPED 

363
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:57,990
THAT ALONG AND PLAYED A KEY 

364
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,591
ROLE IN THAT. 

365
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,059
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT JOHN 

366
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,493
McCAIN, THROUGH FORGIVENESS, 

367
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:02,762
ACCOMPLISHED WHAT WE WERE 

368
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,630
UNABLE TO DO WITH ALL OF OUR 

369
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,098
WEAPONS OF WAR. 

370
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,666
HE WAS ABLE TO ESTABLISH 

371
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,368
RELATIONS WITH A COUNTRY THAT 

372
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:15,841
TURNED OUT TO BE A KEY ALLY FOR 

373
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,442
THE UNITED STATES. 

374
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:17,943
AND IF WE EVER NEEDED A KEY 

375
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,278
ALLY IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD, 

376
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:20,312
RIGHT NOW IS THE TIME. 

377
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:21,313
>> HE IS CELEBRATED THERE. 

378
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:22,281
IT'S TREMENDOUS. 

379
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:26,619
>> WHEN HE CAMPAIGNED IN 2000, 

380
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:33,759
BUT ALSO IN 2008, HE WAS 

381
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,560
TELLING THE STORY OF THE 

382
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,594
VIETNAM WAR FROM A DIFFERENT 

383
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:35,827
ANGLE. 

384
00:11:35,827 --> 00:11:37,296
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A WAR THAT AT 

385
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:38,297
THE TIME SPLIT AMERICA, THERE 

386
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:41,767
WERE PROTESTS AND IT DID NOT, 

387
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:42,668
WE TALK ABOUT THE GREATEST 

388
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:42,968
GENERATION. 

389
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,436
THAT IS THE WORLD WAR II 

390
00:11:44,436 --> 00:11:44,736
GENERATION. 

391
00:11:44,736 --> 00:11:48,340
VIETNAM HAS HAD A BUMPY HISTORY 

392
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,642
AND WHEN YOU SAW PEOPLE AT 

393
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,277
McCAIN RALLIES IN 2000 IN 

394
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,812
PARTICULAR HE WOULD TELL THE 

395
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:53,612
STORIES OF SERVICE AND 

396
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:54,246
SACRIFICE THAT HE WITNESSED 

397
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:55,147
WITH HIS OWN EYES. 

398
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:58,584
AND PEOPLE, TEARS WOULD COME TO 

399
00:11:58,584 --> 00:11:59,919
THEIR EYES AND THEY WOULD LEAP 

400
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:00,920
FROM THEIR SEATS TO APPLAUD 

401
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,587
WHEN HE WAS DONE TELLING THE 

402
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:07,660
STORIES. 

403
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,295
IT WAS IN FUSING THEM IN THE 

404
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,095
VIETNAM WAR, ALL THE BEST 

405
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:11,363
TRADITIONS OF AMERICAN SERVICE 

406
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:11,930
AND SACRIFICE WHICH HAD NOT 

407
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,265
ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE WITH THAT 

408
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:13,465
WAR. 

409
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:14,366
HIS PERSONAL STORY AND HIS 

410
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,501
CAMPAIGNS ALSO CHANGED THE WAY 

411
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:16,402
PEOPLE THOUGHT ABOUT THE 

412
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:16,735
VIETNAM WAR. 

413
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,003
>> THAT YOU COULD DISAGREE WITH 

414
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,004
THE WAR BUT NOT DISHONOR THOSE 

415
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,039
WHO HAD SERVED IN IT. 

416
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,876
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. 

417
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,211
AND THAT YOU WERE KEEPING FAITH 

418
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,879
WITH A CERTAIN SET OF ENDURING 

419
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,147
AMERICAN GOALS, EVEN IN THE 

420
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:32,918
SERVICE OF A WAR THAT PEOPLE 

421
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,053
MIGHT DEBATE ABOUT, ONE OF THE 

422
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,187
THINGS SAID ABOUT JOHN McCAIN 

423
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:36,755
AND I CAN'T REMEMBERWHO SAID 

424
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:40,159
IT, HE COULD HAVE LIVED IN ANY 

425
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:40,893
TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY. 

426
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,394
WHICH IS TO SAY HE WOULD'VE FIT 

427
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:43,229
RIGHT IN WITH TEDDY ROOSEVELT 

428
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,630
AMERICA, HE WOULD FIT RIGHT IN 

429
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,664
WITH THE REVOLUTION BECAUSE OF 

430
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:46,465
HIS DEDICATION TO THOSE BASIC 

431
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,100
AMERICAN PRINCIPLES. 

432
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,535

THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT JOHN

00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,769
McCAIN HIMSELF WANTED. 

467
00:13:57,769 --> 00:13:59,171
THAT IS THE WAY THAT HE WANTED 

468
00:13:59,171 --> 00:13:59,972
TO BE SENT OFF. 

469
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:03,609

478
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:20,526
NANCY I KNEW JOHN WHEN I WAS 

479
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,294
MUCH YOUNGER, WHEN I WAS A 

480
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:24,763
TEENAGER BECAUSE MY UNCLE MOE 

481
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:25,998
TALKED A LOT ABOUT HIM. 

482
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,867
HE TALKED ABOUT THE 

483
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,269
RELATIONSHIP THEY HAD WORKING 

484
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,136

AND REALLY REVERED 

490
00:14:40,712 --> 00:14:42,614
BY A YOUNG CONGRESSMAN McCAIN. 

491
00:14:42,614 --> 00:14:49,955
>> A WONDERFUL STORY IS THAT 

492
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,690
MOE HAD 14 YEARS IN THE HOUSE 

493
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,791
AND HE TOOK JOHN AND UNDER HIS 

494
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:53,926
WING AND TRAVELED AROUND NEW 

495
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:54,626
MEXICO WITH HIM. 

496
00:14:54,626 --> 00:14:54,993
AND ARIZONA. 

497
00:14:54,993 --> 00:14:56,161
AND THE ENTIRE SOUTHWEST AND HE 

498
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,763
SAID THIS IS WHAT THE SOUTHWEST 

499
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,098
IS ABOUT BECAUSE JOHN WAS NEW 

500
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,265
TO THE WHOLE REGION. 

501
00:15:00,265 --> 00:15:05,471
HE SAID NATIVE AMERICANS WE'VE 

502
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,672
GOT TO WORK TOGETHER ON THESE 

503
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:07,806
ISSUES AND FROM THEN ON THAT'S 

504
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:08,607
WHAT THEY DID TOGETHER. 

505
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:09,842
>> Reporter: WHAT WAS IT ABOUT 

506
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:12,878
A YOUNG REPUBLICAN THAT LED MOE 

507
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:16,048
UDALL TO TAKE HIM UNDER HIS 

508
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:16,582
WING? 

509
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,950
>> I THINK HE SAW THE PROMISE 

510
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,485
IN JOHN McCAIN AND SAW THAT HE 

511
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,387
HAD A REAL CORE AND THAT HE 

512
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,655
REALLY CARED ABOUT 

513
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:26,925
BIPARTISANSHIP. REALLY WORKING 

514
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:27,926
WITH THE OTHER SIDE AND 

515
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:30,796
TACKLING THE BIG ISSUES. 

516
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,431
THAT IS THE THING TO ME THAT IS 

517
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,868
JUST SO DIFFERENT ABOUT JOHN 

518
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:36,468
McCAIN. 

519
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:37,403
HE HAD THOSE CORE ISSUES 

520
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,604
WHETHER IT WAS CLIMATE CHANGE 

521
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,039
OR IMMIGRATION OR ON THE ISSUE 

522
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:44,043
OF HEALTHCARE WHERE HE SAID YOU 

523
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:45,544
CAN FOLLOW THIS REGULAR ORDER 

524
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:49,048
SO I'M HOLDING DOWN THE 

525
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:49,848
HEALTHCARE, HE WAS JUST A 

526
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:52,484
SPECIAL PERSON TO ALL OF US. 

527
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:53,519
BUT ESPECIALLY ON THE 

528
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,520
DEMOCRATIC SIDE WHERE WE DON'T 

529
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,989
HAVE MUCH OF THAT ANYMORE. 

530
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,824
THAT IS THE THING I AM GOING TO 

531
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,859
MISS THE MOST I THINK. 

532
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,061
>> Reporter: I NO YOU WILL MISS 

533
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,063
HIM ON A PERSONAL LEVEL AND A 

534
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,464
POLITICAL LEVEL. 

535
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,331

SERVED  WITH HIM IN CONGRESS. 

546

STATE.

GOVERNORS, PRESIDENTS, FOREIGN

MINISTERS, PRIME MINISTERS, AND 

555
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,104
OF COURSE JOHN WE ALSO SEE 

556
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,405
PRISONERS OF WAR. 

557
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:52,010
WHO SERVED WITH HIM. 

558
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,011
>> THAT IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND 

559
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:54,246
THEY WILL BE HIS PALLBEARERS ON 

560
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:55,848
SUNDAY, THOSE PRISONERS OF WAR 

561
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:56,482
WHO SERVED WITH HIM. 

562
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,618
I TALKED TO ONE OF THEM THIS 

563
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:01,587
WEEK, HE WAS IN THE AIR FORCE 

564
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:02,788
IN CAPTIVITY FOR ALMOST 6 YEARS 

565
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:03,222
AS WELL. 

566
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:06,458
AND HE TALKED ABOUT SEEING 

567
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,693
McCAIN, EVERY TIME HE SAW HIM 

568
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:11,829
ON TV HE WOULD STOP AND WATCH 

569
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,565
HIM AND HE SAID HE NEVER FORGOT 

570
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:13,965
US. 

571
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:16,602
ALL THE PEOPLE THAT HAD BEEN 

572
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,869
WITH HIM. 

573
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:19,838
AND THEY ARE PAYING HONOR TO 

574
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:20,239
HIM TODAY. 

575
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:24,175
>> AMONG THAT GROUP, EDWARD 

576
00:17:24,175 --> 00:17:26,111
ALVAREZ WHO WAS THE FIRST 

577
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,079
PRISONER OF WAR. 

578
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,648
HE WAS THE LONGEST IN PRISON 

579
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:30,949
THERE. 

580
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:36,121
WHAT A REMARKABLE -- 

581
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:36,989
>> YOU'RE WATCHING NOW WIDOW 

582
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:43,529
CINDY McCAIN WALK WITH A NUMBER 

583
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:44,029
OF TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 

584
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:44,563
OFFICIALS SURROUNDING HER 

585
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,564
THERE, YOU SEE SECRETARY OF 

586
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,733
DEFENSE JIM MATUS AT HER SIDE, 

587
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,736
AND ANOTHER MARINE,  A CHIEF OF 

588
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,670
STAFF TO PRESIDENT. 

589
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,273
TRUMP , GENERAL. 

590
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,808
JOHN KELLY WALKING BESIDE HER.  

591
00:17:56,808 --> 00:17:58,777
KELLY WAS ALSO A FRIEND AS WAS 

592
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:04,516
JIM MATUS. 

593
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:05,751
SURROUNDED THERE AS WELL BY ALL 

594
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,820
OF HIS CHILDREN. 

595
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,289
THE HISTORY OF SERVICE, THAT 

596
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,891
TIES HEIGHT OF THE TIES TO THE 

597
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:20,398
MILITARY -- THEY ARE -- THE 

598
00:18:20,398 --> 00:18:24,770
TIES TO THE MILITARY, SENATOR. 

599
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:29,708
McCAIN WAS ALSO IN  -- OFTEN 

600
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,308
CREDITED WITH VISITING 

601
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:32,578
BATTLEFIELD UP UNTIL THE VERY 

602
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:36,415
END. 

603
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,816
I REMEMBER HE CROSSED INTO THE 

604
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:38,850
BATTLEFIELD IN SYRIA OF ALL THE 

605
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,285
PLACES, I THINK HE WAS ONE OF 

606
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,787
THE VERY FIRST OF VISUALS TO 

607
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,354
CONSIDER DOING THAT. 

608
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,223
HIS AGE DID NOT GIVE HIM ANY 

609
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,792
KIND OF PAUSE. 

610
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,826
>> I REMEMBER ASKING HIM ONCE 

611
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,462
ON FACE THE NATION WHEN HE WAS 

612
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:55,000
IN KIEV OR SOMEPLACE AND I SAID 

613
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,768
AREN'T YOU PUTTING YOUR LIFE IN 

614
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,904
DANGER AND HE JUST STARTED 

615
00:18:58,904 --> 00:18:59,171
LAUGHING. 

616
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:02,808
HE SAID BOB, I WILL DIE IN BED. 

617
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,576
I'M GOING TO DIE IN BED. 

618
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:08,714
>> AND ON PLANE FLIGHTS HE USED 

619
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:09,514
TO DO THAT, TOO. 

620
00:19:09,514 --> 00:19:11,149
WHEN YOU CAMPAIGNED WITH HIM HE 

621
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:12,584
NEVER WOULD FLY AROUND WEATHER 

622
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:13,685
AND CAMPAIGN PLANES HE WOULD 

623
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:14,620
ALWAYS SAY DON'T WORRY ABOUT 

624
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,954
IT, I'VE CRASHED IN PLANES 

625
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:16,187
MYSELF. 

626
00:19:16,187 --> 00:19:18,390
THREE I THINK. 

627
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:22,160
WE ARE GOING TO BE OKAY. 

628
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,962
McCAIN'S DON'T GO OUT AND PLANE 

629
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:24,496
CRASHES. 

630
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,732
HE HAD THAT FATALISM TO HIM. 

631
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:30,469
AND HE WANTED TO GO, LINDSEY 

632
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,303
GRAHAM TALKED ABOUT THIS THIS 

633
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:31,770
WEEK. 

634
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,771
HE WANTED TO GO AND SPEAK FACE-

635
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,273
TO-FACE WITH THE GENERALS AND 

636
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:39,478
THE PEOPLE UP AND DOWN THE RANK.

637
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:40,812
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THAT WAS THE 

638
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,014
ONLY WAY YOU CAN REALLY FIGURE 

639
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,448
OUT WHAT WAS TRULY GOING ON. 

640
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:44,883
>> IT'S LIKE, WE WERE TALKING 

641
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,251
ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY, IT'S LIKE 

642
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,453
WE ALL KNOW IN THE BUSINESS WHO 

643
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:49,154
DOES THEIR OWN WORK. 

644
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:51,390
WHO DOES THEIR OWN REPORTING. 

645
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,624
WHO DEPENDS ON OTHERS TO DO 

646
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:53,725
THAT FOR YOU. 

647
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,260
JOHN McCAIN DID HIS OWN WORK. 

648
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,497
HE DID HIS OWN REPORTING. 

649
00:19:58,497 --> 00:19:59,731
HE WENT, HE SAW, HE TALKED TO 

650
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:00,432
THE PEOPLE INVOLVED. 

651
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:01,966
AND THEN HE CAME BACK AND 

652
00:20:01,966 --> 00:20:03,802
REPORTED. 

653
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:04,870
>> I WANT TO UNDERSCORE THE 

654
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,872
IMPORTANCE AS WELL OF 

655
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,640
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT BOTH THE 

656
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,509
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE AND THE 

657
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,911
CHIEF OF STAFF TO PRESIDENT. 

658
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,313
TRUMP ARE THERE WITH CINDY 

659
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:14,713
McCAIN TODAY.  

660
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:20,619
OF COURSE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT 

661
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,320
DEEP DIVIDE, BETWEEN THE 

662
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:21,853
PRESIDENT AND SENATOR. 

663
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:22,888
McCAIN, IT WAS THAT MOMENT  

664
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,091
THAT COMES TO SO MANY WHERE THE 

665
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:28,727
PRESIDENT SAID HE DIDN'T 

666
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:34,466
RESPECT McCAIN. LET'S PAUSE FOR 

667
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,101
A MOMENT AS CINDY SAYS HER 

668
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:36,601
PRAYER. 

669
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:36,667
>>>

670
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,808
AND TRAILING BEHIND CINDY 

671
00:21:50,808 --> 00:21:51,810
McCAIN, ALONG WITH CHIEF OF 

672
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,679
STAFF KELLY AND GENERAL MATUS, 

673
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:55,380
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, ARE THE 

674
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,281
OTHER MEMBERS OF THE McCAIN 

675
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:56,514
FAMILY. 

676
00:21:56,514 --> 00:21:59,117
AS YOU CAN SEE, HIS SON JACK 

677
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:07,292
AND HIS NAVY WHITES. 

678
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:08,493
HE IS AN ACTIVE-DUTY NAVAL 

679
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:08,760
OFFICER. 

680
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,961
HIS SON JIMMY AS WELL IS THERE 

681
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,162
WHO IS WEARING AN ARMY UNIFORM. 

682
00:22:11,162 --> 00:22:12,364
HE STARTED AS A MARINE AND 

683
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,598
CONTINUES IN HIS SERVICE NOW AS 

684
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:14,299
AN ARMY OFFICER. 

685
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,200
THAT TRADITION REALLY DOES 

686
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,467
CONTINUE. 

687
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,336
TO PICK UP ON WHERE WE LEFT OFF,

688
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:17,636
PRESIDENT. 

689
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:21,072
TRUMP HAS BEEN  AN ADVOCATE HE 

690
00:22:21,072 --> 00:22:22,674
SAID FOR THE VETERANS COMMUNITY,

691
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,777
WHICH IS WHY IT REALLY WAS SUCH 

692
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,178
A SHOCKING STATEMENT WHEN HE 

693
00:22:27,178 --> 00:22:28,380
QUESTIONED SENATOR. 

694
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,782
McCAIN'S SERVICE.  

695
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,451
IN 2015. 

696
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:33,552
>> AND OF COURSE WE ALL 

697
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:35,520
REMEMBER WILL THINKING THAT IS 

698
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:42,527
INTERESTING FROM DONALD TRUMP, 

699
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,862
HE'LL BE OVER WITHIN A FEW DAYS 

700
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,063
BUT I THINK A REALIZATION FOR 

701
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,097
SO MANY INVOLVED IN AMERICAN 

702
00:22:46,097 --> 00:22:47,098
POLITICS, WE WERE IN A 

703
00:22:47,098 --> 00:22:47,531
DIFFERENT SPACE. 

704
00:22:47,531 --> 00:22:48,733
AND EVER SINCE OF COURSE THEY 

705
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:50,135
HAVE BEEN AT ODDS ON JUST ABOUT 

706
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:50,569
EVERYTHING. 

707
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:51,770
NO SURPRISE, IT CONTINUED THIS 

708
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:55,607
WEEK, I SPOKE TO SOMEONE CLOSE 

709
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:56,608
TO THE FAMILY WHO SAID THAT 

710
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,043
THEY IN NO WAY WERE IN CONTACT 

711
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:04,549
WITH THE WHITE HOUSE THIS WEEK, 

712
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,149
THEY CONVEYED CONCERNS ABOUT 

713
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:05,950
HOW THE PRESIDENT COMPORTED 

714
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:11,790
HIMSELF LAST WEEK ESPECIALLY. 

715
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,425
BUT HAVING THE CHIEF OF STAFF 

716
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:14,326
AND SECRETARY OF DEFENSE THERE 

717
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:19,197
IS CERTAINLY A SIGN OF RESPECT 

718
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:20,198
THAT THE SENATOR DESERVES. 

719
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:21,433
>> WE MIGHT WANT TO POINT OUT 

720
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:22,467
TO PEOPLE THAT THESE OTHER 

721
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:23,769
MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY ARE NOT 

722
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:24,703
AS INITIATED. 

723
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:29,941
ANDREW McCAIN, THE TALLER 

724
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:30,942
GENTLEMAN WITH OUR CARE IS 

725
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:31,977
DOUGLAS McCAIN THE OTHER SON 

726
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:33,311
FROM THE FIRST MARRIAGE. 

727
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:36,481
BRIDGET McCAIN IS CINDY AND THE 

728
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:37,649
SENATORS ADOPTED DAUGHTER. 

729
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:42,654
THERE IS A WOMAN, SIDNEY McCAIN 

730
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:43,989
WHO IS A DAUGHTER FROM HIS 

731
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:44,789
FIRST MARRIAGE TO HIS FIRST 

732
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:45,390
WIFE CAROL. 

733
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,424
THEY HAVE ALL BEEN THERE 

734
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:47,392
THROUGHOUT THE WEEK. 

735
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:49,360
>> WE HEAR AROUND OF APPLAUSE 

736
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:49,861
THERE. 

737
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:53,532
AS THE PEOPLE GATHER TO WATCH 

738
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:56,301
THE McCAIN FAMILY WALK AWAY 

739
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:58,503
FROM THE MEMORIAL. 

740
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:02,440
AND THIS IS A PUBLIC MEMORIAL 

741
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,076
THAT ANYONE VISITING WASHINGTON 

742
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:06,711
CAN GO TO THE MALL AND VISIT 

743
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:07,946
FOR THEMSELVES AND SEE THESE 

744
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,514
CLOUDS -- CROWDS OF ONLOOKERS 

745
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:11,983
TURNING ON THIS MORNING -- 

746
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,752
TURNING OUT THIS MORNING TO PAY 

747
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,821
THEIR RESPECTS. 

748
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:19,023
>> YOU WERE TALKING MARGARET 

749
00:24:19,023 --> 00:24:23,428
ABOUT HOW JOHN USED TO GO DOWN 

750
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:26,064
THERE BY HIMSELF, HE WOULD JUST 

751
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:28,667
GO, IT WAS NOT A PHOTO OP OR 

752
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,502
ANYTHING LIKE THAT. 

753
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:33,004
THAT WAS SO MUCH JOHN McCAIN. 

754
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:34,306
HE USED TO DO THE SAME ABOUT 

755
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,341
GOING UP TO WALTER REED. 

756
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:38,076
WHERE ALL OF THE WAR WOUNDED 

757
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:38,977
WERE. 

758
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,611
HE DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY HE WAS 

759
00:24:40,611 --> 00:24:43,248
GOING. 

760
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,783
HE CALLED ME UP ONE DAY AND SET 

761
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:46,284
I'M GOING TO GO OUT THERE, DO 

762
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:47,519
YOU WANT TO GO WITH ME? 

763
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,789
I KNEW IT WASN'T TO DO A NEW 

764
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:51,823
STORY OR ANYTHING, HE JUST 

765
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,058
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I SAW 

766
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:53,959
WHAT WAS OUT THERE. 

767
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,927
HE WOULD JUST GO AND HE DID 

768
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:59,764
THAT A LOT, IT WAS NOT JUST 

769
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,166
EVERY ONCE AND A WHILE, HE JUST 

770
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,801
FELT IT WAS PART OF HIS DUTY TO 

771
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,202
GO OUT THERE AND CHECK ON THE 

772
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:07,339
GUYS AND SEE HOW THEY WERE. 

773
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,074
>> THAT'S RIGHT AND HE SAW THAT 

774
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:10,408
AS BOTH IN KEEPING WITH HIS 

775
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:13,511
MILITARY SERVICE, THAT YOUR 

776
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:14,546
SERVICE DOESN'T BEGIN AND END 

777
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:15,647
WITH THE BEGINNING AND ENDING 

778
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:16,882
UP WHEN YOU'RE ACTIVE, THAT YOU 

779
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:18,016
ARE THE STUDENT OR -- STEWARD 

780
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,918
OF A LONG MILITARY TRADITION. 

781
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:25,724
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT MOE UDALL, 

782
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:26,758
McCAIN USED TO VISIT HIM, WHO 

783
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,126
TUTORED HIM IN WHAT 

784
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:32,030
BIPARTISANSHIP WAS. 

785
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,964
THAT YOU SHARED MORE AS 

786
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:33,765
AMERICANS THAN AS POLITICAL 

787
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:34,366
OPPONENTS FROM DIFFERENT 

788
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,700
PARTIES AND HE WENT TO GO VISIT 

789
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,102
MOE UDALL WHEN HE WAS IN THE 

790
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:37,936
VETERANS HOSPITAL WITH 

791
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:39,471
PARKINSON'S, WHEN LONG AFTER HE 

792
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,973
LEFT THE HOUSE, BECAUSE HE WAS 

793
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:43,007
STILL ATTENDING THAT 

794
00:25:43,007 --> 00:25:43,808
RELATIONSHIP. 

795
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:45,577
HE SAW THE STEWARDSHIP THAT WAS 

796
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:49,481
REQUIRED AND BY JUST SIMPLE 

797
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:50,382
FRIENDSHIP, NOT THE STEWARDSHIP 

798
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,516
REQUIRED WHEN YOU ARE IN THE 

799
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:56,121
SERVICE BUT THE THINGS THAT LIFE

800
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:57,422
, LIFE IS LONG AND THERE ARE 

801
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:58,557
THINGS THAT ARE WORTH PAYING 

802
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,991
ATTENTION TO EVEN IF THEY GET 

803
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:00,625
YOU NOTHING POLITICALLY. 

804
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:01,693
BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT BEING AN 

805
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:02,961
HONORABLE PERSON IS ABOUT. 

806
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:05,663
>> DESPITE THAT, THE STATEMENT 

807
00:26:05,663 --> 00:26:07,599
THAT THEN CANDIDATE DONALD 

808
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,601
TRUMP MADE ABOUT SENATOR. 

809
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:12,570
McCAIN'S SERVICE,  I PREFER 

810
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,872
THOSE WHO WEREN'T CAPTURED, THE 

811
00:26:14,872 --> 00:26:17,709
SENATOR NEVER ASKED FOR AN 

812
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:18,677
APOLOGY. 

813
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:21,279
IF ANYTHING HE SAID HE THOUGHT 

814
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,048
THAT VETERANS HEARD IT AND KNEW 

815
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:25,116
WHAT IT WAS. 

816
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:26,651
HE SAW IT AS AN OFFENSE TO 

817
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:27,452
OTHER VETERANS WHO HAD BEEN 

818
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:28,086
CAPTURED AND KILLED. 

819
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,921
>> AND ACTIVE-DUTY. 

820
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,656
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE GOD FOR BID 

821
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:32,890
IN THE SERVICE AND CAPTURED, 

822
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,427
WHAT SUSTAINS YOU IS THAT 

823
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,428
EVERYBODY BACK HOME THINKS YOU 

824
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:40,632
ARE A HERO AND THINKS YOU WERE 

825
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:41,900
CAPTURED IN THE SERVICE OF YOUR 

826
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,500
COUNTRY MAINTAINING ALL THOSE 

827
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,735
IDEALS THAT WE PUT AT THE 

828
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:44,769
CENTER OF OUR PUBLIC LIFE. 

829
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:45,937
AND THAT TENDING THOSE AT HOME 

830
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,973
IS PART OF AN AMERICAN DUTY. 

831
00:26:48,973 --> 00:26:50,208
SO TO SUGGEST THAT THEY ARE 

832
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:51,109
SOMEHOW LESSER IS AN OFFENSE 

833
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,445
NOT JUST TO JOHN McCAIN BUT TO 

834
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,479
EVERYBODY WHO IS SERVING 

835
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:55,280
PRESENTLY AND HAS. 

836
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:00,251
AND I'M NOT JUST MAKING THAT UP.

837
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:02,019
THIS IS WHAT POWS THAT I TALKED 

838
00:27:02,019 --> 00:27:03,355
TO HAVE SAID AND MEMBERS OF THE 

839
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:04,255
MILITARY, THEY HAVE SAID THAT 

840
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:05,490
WAS THEIR REACTION TO THEIR 

841
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:05,757
REMARKS. 

842
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:12,997
>> IS THAT -- IF THAT IS HOW 

843
00:27:12,997 --> 00:27:13,998
YOU FELT ABOUT THOSE WHO WERE 

844
00:27:13,998 --> 00:27:15,233
CAPTURED, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT 

845
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:16,234
THOSE WHO WERE KILLED? 

846
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:17,469
I MEAN THE LOGIC OF TRYING TO 

847
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,870
SORT ALL OF THAT OUT IS, BUT 

848
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:19,871
THIS TODAY IS ABOUT JOHN 

849
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:20,104
McCAIN. 

850
00:27:20,104 --> 00:27:20,471
>> EXACTLY. 

851
00:27:20,471 --> 00:27:24,476
WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT. 

852
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,178
>> YES . 

853
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:29,013
>> WE WANT TO GO TO ONE OF 

854
00:27:29,013 --> 00:27:29,814
THOSE VETERANS DOWN THERE AT 

855
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:30,982
THE MEMORIAL AND TO CBS 

856
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:35,487
CORRESPONDENT MULLEN LANGI, 

857
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:41,326
>> Reporter: I AM JOINED BY A 

858
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,460
VIETNAM VETERAN WHO CAME OUT TO 

859
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,661
PAY RESPECTS TO THE SENATOR AND 

860
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:44,696
HIS FAMILY, GOOD MORNING MR. 

861
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:44,963
STERLING. 

862
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,331
WHY DID YOU COME OUT TODAY? 

863
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,033
>> FIRST OF ALL I BELIEVE THAT 

864
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:48,299
SENATOR. 

865
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:49,367
McCAIN  WAS DEFINITELY A HERO 

866
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,169
TO OUR COUNTRY. 

867
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,470
>> Reporter: WHAT DID YOU THINK 

868
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,306
OF THE EVENT AND THE MEMORIAL 

869
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:55,840
OUT HERE? 

870
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,675
>> I THINK IT WAS REAL QUICK, 

871
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:59,911
AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEEN A 

872
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:00,244
LITTLE MORE. 

873
00:28:00,244 --> 00:28:04,249
BUT IT'S NOT WHAT I WANT, IT'S 

874
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:05,717
MAYBE WHAT THE PUBLIC WANTS, 

875
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:13,825
BUT ALSO THE MISSES AS WELL. 

876
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:14,759
>> Reporter: YOU CALL THE LATE 

877
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:15,059
SENATOR. 

878
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:16,561
A HERO, HE WAS ONE TOO OFTEN 

879
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:17,996
SAY HE WAS NOT A HERO, THAT HE 

880
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:19,330
SERVED IN THE COMPANY OF HEROES 

881
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,932
BUT HE DENIES  THE IDEA THAT HE 

882
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:21,633
WAS A HERO. 

883
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:22,867
>> AND THAT'S WHY LIKE HIM. 

884
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,636
HE DENIES THE FACT, HE'S NOT A 

885
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:25,370
NARCISSISTIC INDIVIDUAL. 

886
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:30,141
HE WAS A PERSON OF TRUE, WHAT 

887
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:32,377
YOU SEE OF McCAIN IS McCAIN. 

888
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,611
>> Reporter: WHAT DOES THE LATE 

889
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:33,911
SENATOR. 

890
00:28:33,911 --> 00:28:38,483
MEAN  TO NONVETERANS, WHAT DOES 

891
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:39,818
IT MEAN TO VETERANS IN THE 

892
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:40,084
MILITARY? 

893
00:28:40,084 --> 00:28:41,719
>> THERE IS A LOT OF SEX PRICES 

894
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:43,221
AND THIS MAN SACRIFICED IT MUCH 

895
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:47,358
MORE THAN MANY OF US DO. 

896
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:49,227
WHEN I SEE THAT AND KNOW THAT 

897
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:54,566
HE WAS AN INSTRUMENTAL LEADER 

898
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,767
FOR PRISONERS OF WAR I FEEL 

899
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:59,003
THAT HE WAS, SHOW THE STRENGTH 

900
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:00,772
THAT THIS NATION IS ALL ABOUT. 

901
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:03,775
>> Reporter: MR. STERLING,

FOR STOPPING BY. 

904
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:10,982
>> ONE TAKE BUT ALL SERIOUSLY 

905
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:13,084
-- OBVIOUSLY A PERSPECTIVE THAT 

906
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:13,585
MANY VETERANS 

907
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:16,487
TAKE. 

908
00:29:16,487 --> 00:29:17,722
AND I DON'T TAKE IT WAS BY 

909
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:19,324
ACCIDENT THAT THE SENATOR KNEW 

910
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:21,926
ALL OF US HERE ON NETWORKS 

911
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,028
ACROSS THE COUNTRY WOULD BE 

912
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:26,030
SHOWING THAT SHOT OF ALL OF 

913
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:26,030
THOSE NAMES. 

914
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,266
<u>%-ú </u>

915
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,801
WREATH SAYING TO ALL OF THOSE 

916
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:30,769
WHO HAVE SERVED. 

917
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,503
THAT WAS NOT SENATOR. 

918
00:29:32,503 --> 00:29:33,538
McCAIN'S NAME ON THAT READS, 

919
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:34,339
THAT WAS EVERYONE.  

920
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:36,875
IN THAT CONFLICT. 

921
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:40,578
SO IT WAS A VERY DELIBERATE 

922
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:45,116
CHOICE, AND THEY ARE MOVING OUT 

923
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,117
TO THE NATIONAL CATHEDRAL TO 

924
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,452
BEGIN THE SERVICE, THE FORMAL 

925
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,152
SERVICE HONORING THE LIFE OF 

926
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:48,553
SENATOR. 

927
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:49,187
McCAIN.  

928
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:54,259
AND YOU CAN SEE INSIDE THAT 

929
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:54,893
CATHEDRAL, THE EPISCOPAL 

930
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:56,461
CATHEDRAL, I THINK IT IS THE 

931
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,129
ONLY CATHEDRAL THAT WAS 

932
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,163
ESTABLISHED BY AN ACT OF 

933
00:29:59,163 --> 00:30:00,164
CONGRESS IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN. 

934
00:30:00,164 --> 00:30:03,635
AND THAT SERVICE, THEY CAN SEAT 

935
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,035
SOMETHING LIKE 

936
00:30:04,368 --> 00:30:09,073
4000 PEOPLE INSIDE OF IT. 

937
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:10,308
YOU WOULD THINK THAT THOSE PEWS 

938
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,509
ARE GOING TO BE PACKED TODAY. 

939
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:12,510
SO MANY WANTED TO COME OUT. 

940
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,645
>> IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL. 

941
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,946
THERE IS NO BETTER PLACE TO 

942
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:16,347
HAVE A FUNERAL THAN THE 

943
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:17,715
NATIONAL CATHEDRAL. 

944
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:19,684
WELL, LOOK AT THE PICTURES. 

945
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:23,521
IT IS STUNNING. 

946
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:28,559
>> IN ANY EVENT, IT -- AND ANY 

947
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:35,500
EVENT THAT DRAWS THE LIKES OF 

948
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,334
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT AND JAY LENO 

949
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,936
IS GOING TO BE A STELLAR EVENT. 

950
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:39,137
OF COURSE GEORGE W. BUSH AND 

951
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:40,038
BARACK OBAMA WILLS THE, BILL 

952
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,072
CLINTON AND HILLARY CLINTON 

953
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:43,508

CHENEY, GABBY GIFFORDS OF 

957
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:53,918
COURSE, THE FORMER 

958
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:55,286
CONGRESSWOMAN FROM ARIZONA. 

959
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,622
AND AN ARRAY OF FORMER -- 

960
00:30:57,622 --> 00:31:00,525
FOREIGN DIGNITARIES. 

961
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:04,162
>> TOP DIPLOMATS FROM A NUMBER 

962
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:04,963
OF ARAB COUNTRIES IN 

963
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:08,433
PARTICULAR, SAUDI ARABIA, QATAR,

964
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:09,434
YOU TOUCHED ON THIS EARLY 

965
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:10,468
PERIOD OF THE FOREIGN LEADERS 

966
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:12,069
THEY ARE FROM COUNTRIES WHO 

967
00:31:12,069 --> 00:31:14,872
FEEL VERY MUCH AT RISK OF 

968
00:31:14,872 --> 00:31:15,907
INVASION OR AGGRESSION BY 

969
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:16,574
RUSSIA. 

970
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:18,743
SENATOR. 

971
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:19,777
McCAIN  REALLY STANDING OUT, 

972
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:21,746
PART OF HIS LEGACY WAS BEING 

973
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:26,084
VERY MUCH A FOIL TO VLADIMIR 

974
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:30,955
PUTIN OF RUSSIA, HE HAS HERE ON 

975
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:32,190
THIS LIST THE PRESIDENT OF 

976
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,391
UKRAINE, THE AHEAD OF NATO, 

977
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,425
HE'S GOT THE PRESIDENT, THE 

978
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:37,061
FORMER PRESIDENT OF GEORGIA. 

979
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:37,862
ALL SMALL COUNTRIES, THAT 

980
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:40,732
WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE ON THE 

981
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,467
LIST OF WORLD POWERS BUT THOSE 

982
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:45,169
WHO FELT THAT THEY NEEDED A 

983
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:46,170
STRONG ALLY AND FOUND ONE IN 

984
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:46,771
SENATOR. 

985
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:47,905
McCAIN.  

986
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:49,640
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 

987
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,241
AND HE DID THIS WHILE HE WAS 

988
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:51,642
SICK. 

989
00:31:51,642 --> 00:31:55,013
I MEAN REALLY UNTIL HE WENT TO 

990
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:57,348
ARIZONA FOR TREATMENT, HE WAS 

991
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:58,516
STILL FLINGING HIMSELF ACROSS 

992
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,585
THE GLOBE TO TELL LITTLE 

993
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,819
COUNTRIES AND PEOPLE, KEEP THE 

994
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:02,052
FAITH. 

995
00:32:02,052 --> 00:32:04,255
AMERICA WON'T FORGET YOU.

996
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:08,626
SOMETHING LIKE NATO, FOR ME, 

997
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:09,560
NATO, THE SENATE AND HIS 

998
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,395
MILITARY CAREER ARE ALL THE 

999
00:32:11,395 --> 00:32:15,233
PIECE, YOU HAVE THESE 

1000
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:15,867
AGREEMENTS AND INSTITUTIONS, 

1001
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:17,068
THESE ALLIANCES THAT YOU TEND 

1002
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,903
BECAUSE IT IS NOT ALWAYS 

1003
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:20,738
WONDERFUL IN THE WORLD. 

1004
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:22,106
AND YOU NEED YOUR FRIENDS IN 

1005
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:22,539
MOMENTS OF CRISIS. 

1006
00:32:22,539 --> 00:32:26,110
AND YOU NEED A BEACON FOR SMALL 

1007
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,713
COUNTRIES UNDER OPPRESSION TO 

1008
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:30,815
BE ABLE TO LOOK TO A BEACON AND 

1009
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:32,884
SAY PERHAPS WE CAN GET THEIR 

1010
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:33,651
ASSISTANCE. 

1011
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:35,319
THERE IS SOMEBODY OUT THERE WHO 

1012
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:40,224
IS ON OUR SIDE. 

1013
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:41,459
AND IF YOU DON'T ATTEND THOSE 

1014
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,560
FIRES, IF YOU DON'T KEEP THOSE 

1015
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,694
ALLIANCES AND KEEP THE 

1016
00:32:43,694 --> 00:32:44,294
STRUCTURES, THOSE PEOPLE IN 

1017
00:32:44,294 --> 00:32:45,763
FARAWAY PLACES LOSE FAITH. 

1018
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:48,966
>> IT IS A LINE OF DEFENSE THAT 

1019
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:49,367
THE SENATOR 

1020
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:55,440
FELT THAT THE UNITED STATES WAS 

1021
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:55,840
WEAKENING ON. 

1022
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,941
WHICH IS WHY HE FELT SO 

1023
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:58,876
STRONGLY ABOUT DEFENDING IT IN 

1024
00:32:58,876 --> 00:32:59,577
THE PAST FEW YEARS. 

1025
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:02,547
>> AND HE NEVER APOLOGIZED FOR 

1026
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:03,748
THE UNITED STATES PLAYING A 

1027
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:05,082
MAJOR ROLE IN THE WORLD. 

1028
00:33:05,082 --> 00:33:06,751
>> THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF 

1029
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,619
GEORGIA SAID HE GOT A CALL FROM 

1030
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:13,958
JOHN McCAIN WHEN -- AND HE SAID 

1031
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,660
JUST SAY YOU WON'T SURRENDER. 

1032
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:23,501
AND HE THOUGHT WHAT IS THAT? 

1033
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,402
PEOPLE LIKE TO STAND WITH 

1034
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:25,336
PEOPLE WHO WANT SURRENDER, JUST 

1035
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,504
BE LIKE CHURCHILL. 

1036
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,705
>> AND THERE IS FORMER HOUSE 

1037
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:29,307
SPEAKER JOHN WEINER, THERE IS 

1038
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:34,445
CURRENT SPEAKER PAUL RYAN. 

1039
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:35,613
>> LOTS OF INTERESTING 

1040
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:39,117
CONVERSATIONS TODAY.

1041
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,021
>> THERE IS OUR HUNT OF THE 

1042
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:48,025
WALL STREET JOURNAL, 

1043
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:49,694
>> LINDSEY GRAHAM TOLD THE 

1044
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,530
STORY OF JUST WHAT YOU WERE 

1045
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,500
SAYING, McCAIN AND GRAHAM WERE 

1046
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,601
ON THE ROAD SOMEWHERE AND HE 

1047
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:57,435
COULDN'T REMEMBER WHAT COUNTRY 

1048
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:58,636
THEY WERE IN BUT McCAIN 

1049
00:33:58,636 --> 00:33:59,937
REVENUES WERE ART ABOUT IN AGES 

1050
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:00,638
AND COUNTRY AND WHICH 500 

1051
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:09,580
PEOPLE HAD BEEN HIDE UP BUT 

1052
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,114
McCAIN READ AN ARTICLE ABOUT AN 

1053
00:34:11,114 --> 00:34:12,315
ATCHISON COUNTRY AND WHICH 500 

1054
00:34:12,315 --> 00:34:19,357
PEOPLE HAD BEEN KILLED -- 

1055
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:21,324
McCAIN READ AN ARTICLE ABOUT AN 

1056
00:34:21,324 --> 00:34:23,427
ATCHISON COUNTRY WHERE 500 

1057
00:34:23,427 --> 00:34:26,864
PEOPLE HAD BEEN KILLED AND HE 

1058
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:28,099
ASKED LINDSEY GRAHAM IF HE 

1059
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:31,034
WANTED TO GO THERE AND LINDSAY 

1060
00:34:31,034 --> 00:34:33,538
SAID WHAT YOU WANT TO BE 501 

1061
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:34,371
AND 502? 

1062
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:42,079
>> ONE POLITICAL PRISONER IN 

1063
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,481
EGYPT SAID HE HAD NEVER BEEN A 

1064
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:44,315
REPUBLICAN, HE HAD NEVER 

1065
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:44,782
SUPPORTED A 

1066
00:34:45,081 --> 00:34:45,817
REPUBLICAN AND HE SAW McCAIN'S 

1067
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:47,051
NAME IN PRINT, HE HEARD A 

1068
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:49,820
SENATOR STAND UP AND SAY HIS 

1069
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,856
NAME AND HE SAID WITHOUT THAT I 

1070
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,690
WOULD PROBABLY STILL BE IN JAIL.

1071
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:58,963
AND WHO WILL THAT VOICE BE NOW? 

1072
00:34:58,963 --> 00:34:59,997
BECAUSE AS WE SAY IT WASN'T 

1073
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:01,299
JUST ABOUT THE FENCE, IT WAS 

1074
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:02,200
DEFENDING AMERICAN VALUES AND 

1075
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,434
THAT WAS THE QUESTION FROM SO 

1076
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,069
MANY ABOUT SO MANY OF THESE 

1077
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:05,870
ELECTED LEADERS WHO ARE 

1078
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,538
GATHERED AT THE CATHEDRAL, WHO 

1079
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:12,743
STEPS UP INTO THAT ROLE? 

1080
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:13,544
IN SOME WAYS THAT IS THE 

1081
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:14,578
QUESTION, IS THAT THE CHALLENGE 

1082
00:35:14,578 --> 00:35:15,913
THAT HE IS PUTTING FORTH HERE? 

1083
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:17,415
>> GIVE ME A WEEK AND I'LL COME 

1084
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,316
UP WITH A LIST. 

1085
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:20,017
>> YOU'D BETTER HAVE ONE READY 

1086
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:20,851
AT HAND. 

1087
00:35:20,851 --> 00:35:22,186
>> I DON'T THINK THAT WILL EVER 

1088
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:24,055
BE ANOTHER JOHN McCAIN BUT WHO 

1089
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:25,323
WILL BECOME THE CONSCIENCE OF 

1090
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:26,190
THE SENATE? 

1091
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,325
>> IS A TEST.

1092
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:33,698
THESE FIVE DAYS HAVE BEEN A TEST

1093
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:34,899
WHICH IS THAT ALL OF THESE 

1094
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:35,933
CHARACTERISTICS THAT HAVE BEEN 

1095
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:37,034
LAUDED BY THESE PEOPLE 

1096
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,970
CONTINUOUSLY. 

1097
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,371
AND SO OFTEN WHEN YOU HEAR THAT 

1098
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:41,772
YOU SAY OKAY, WHO'S GOING TO 

1099
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:42,039
STEP UP. 

1100
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,975
AND IF YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE 

1101
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,677
PEOPLE, WHAT OF JOHN McCAIN DO 

1102
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:47,778
YOU SEE IN YOURSELF? 

1103
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:48,512
THAT IS WHAT SENATOR.  

1104
00:35:48,512 --> 00:35:51,882
GRAHAM WAS TALKING ABOUT. 

1105
00:35:51,882 --> 00:36:01,325
EVERY MEMBER SAYS THAT FOR 

1106
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,260
WHATEVER THEIR CAUSE IS, CAN 

1107
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:02,960
THEY PASS THE TEST? 

1108
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,362
CAN THEY PASS THE TEST OF 

1109
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:05,396
WHETHER THEY KEPT THEIR VALUES 

1110
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:06,497
AND DIDN'T JUST TALK ABOUT IT 

1111
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,431
BUT ACTED ON IT? 

1112
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:08,432
>> THERE MAY BE TWO SENATORS 

1113
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:09,767
WHO ARE CLOSE TO McCAIN, WHO 

1114
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:10,868
CAN FILL SOME OF THE VOID. 

1115
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:11,702
CERTAINLY LINDSEY GRAHAM WHEN 

1116
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:12,903
IT COMES TO NATIONAL SECURITY 

1117
00:36:12,903 --> 00:36:13,571
ISSUES AND REPRESENTING THE 

1118
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:14,505
COUNTRY OVERSEAS BUT I THINK 

1119
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:18,542
SUSAN COLLINS IS ANOTHER ONE 

1120
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:19,777
WHO ESPECIALLY THIS YEAR HAS 

1121
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:21,145
SERVED AS A MEDIATOR BETWEEN 

1122
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:21,712
THE PARTIES. 

1123
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:22,212
>> REPUBLICAN SENATOR. 

1124
00:36:22,212 --> 00:36:23,214
FROM MAINE.  

1125
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:27,084
>> YES, SOMEONE WHO IS QUITE 

1126
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:28,519
CLOSE TO HIM AND WHO HAS LENT 

1127
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,754
HER OFFICE TO SOME PRETTY 

1128
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:30,755
SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS THIS YEAR, 

1129
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,623
ISSUES THAT NEEDED TO BE 

1130
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:35,459
ADDRESSED AND IN SOME WAYS SHE 

1131
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:36,460
WAS FILLING A VOID THAT McCAIN 

1132
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,895
WOULD HAVE BEEN FILLING HAD HE 

1133
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:38,195
BEEN THERE. 

1134
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:40,264
>> WE ALSO SAW IN THAT LAST 

1135
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:41,766
SHOT, DAN COATS, THE GOVERNOR 

1136
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:43,800
OF OHIO JUNK ASIC AS WELL WHO 

1137
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:57,648
SERVED -- JOHN K SICK, ON 

1138
00:36:57,648 --> 00:36:58,049
WEEKENDS 

1139
00:36:58,349 --> 00:36:59,016
IN WASHINGTON, PARTICULARLY ON 

1140
00:36:59,016 --> 00:36:59,984
LABOR DAY, YOU DO NOT SEE 

1141
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:01,419
ELECTED OFFICIALS HERE IN THE 

1142
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:02,019
NATION'S CAPITAL. 

1143
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:03,087
THEY HAVE ALL STUCK AROUND 

1144
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:04,188
BECAUSE THEY ALL WANTED TO BE 

1145
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:05,122
HERE TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS. 

1146
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:06,757
AND THIS FINAL PUBLIC DAY OF 

1147
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:08,926
CELEBRATION, YOU SEE THE 

1148
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:10,695
PRESIDENT'S DAUGHTER IF ANKE 

1149
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,530
TRUMP, COUNSELOR TO THE 

1150
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,865
PRESIDENT AND ANOTHER TOP 

1151
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,901
ADVISOR JARED KUSHNER THERE 

1152
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:21,639
HOLDING HER HAND. 

1153
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:22,740
SO THE TRUMP FAMILY, NOT JUST 

1154
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,574
THE TRUMPET MINISTRATION IS 

1155
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,575
BEING REPRESENTED TODAY, WE NO 

1156
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,610
THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF 

1157
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:29,045
DELIBERATELY NOT PART OF THE 

1158
00:37:29,045 --> 00:37:30,247
SERVICES. 

1159
00:37:30,247 --> 00:37:31,282
>> HE WASN'T INVITED. 

1160
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:32,683
TO BE FAIR. 

1161
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:35,052
HE WASN'T INVITED. 

1162
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:37,521
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 

1163
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:39,023
WHEN I SAY DELIBERATE I MEAN ON 

1164
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:40,658
BEHALF OF THE McCAIN FAMILY. 

1165
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:44,862
AND THAT GOES TO A SERIES OF 

1166
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:47,398
DISAGREEMENTS, DISPUTES, OVER 

1167
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:52,436
THE PAST FEW YEARS. 

1168
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,404
AND REALLY WE DON'T WANT TO 

1169
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:54,438
MAKE THIS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. 

1170
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,473
THIS IS ABOUT SENATOR. 

1171
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:55,940
McCAIN BUT SENATOR. 

1172
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,775
McCAIN'S  LAST BOOK RESTLESS 

1173
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,510
WAVE WAS LARGELY ABOUT WHAT HE 

1174
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,277
SAW HAPPENING IN THIS COUNTRY 

1175
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:01,746
ú 

1176
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:02,146
ABOUT PRESIDENT. 

1177
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:03,381
TRUMP  AND SOME OF THE FORCES 

1178
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:04,849
THAT HE SAW HIM REPRESENTATIVE 

1179
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:05,015
OF. 

1180
00:38:05,015 --> 00:38:08,185
A SYMPTOM REALLY IS WHAT HE 

1181
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:09,387
DESCRIBED HIM AS, OF SOME OF 

1182
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:11,789
THE FRUSTRATIONS HE HAD.

1183
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:17,828
HE REALLY WAS FRUSTRATED WITH 

1184
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:18,629
THE DIRECTION OF THE COUNTRY 

1185
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,164
AND SOME ARE SAYING THAT MAYBE 

1186
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:20,965
TODAY THIS ORCHESTRATION OF 

1187
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:21,499
BIPARTISANSHIP IS HIS 

1188
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:24,735
COUNTERPOINT TO THAT. 

1189
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:25,236
>> IT 

1190
00:38:25,669 --> 00:38:28,572
WILL BE INTERESTING TO HEAR, WE 

1191
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,174
SAW SOME OF THIS IN ARIZONA AT 

1192
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:31,609
THE SERVICE FOR HIM THERE, FROM 

1193
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:34,011
FORMER VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN,  

1194
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:36,480
THE EXTENT TO WHICH PRESIDENT. 

1195
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,081
OBAMA AND PRESIDENT.  

1196
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:40,551
BUSH SPEAK TO THAT OR DO THEY 

1197
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:42,052
KEEP THIS JUST ABOUT JOHN 

1198
00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:44,522
McCAIN. 

1199
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:51,328
AGAIN, JOHN McCAIN IS A SYMBOL 

1200
00:38:51,328 --> 00:38:52,596
OF SOMETHING AND WHAT IS HE A 

1201
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:52,963
SYMBOL OF? 

1202
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:54,598
AND WHAT DO WE DO WITH THAT? 

1203
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:56,000
DO WE JUST SAY THIS IS NICE OR 

1204
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,234
IS THAT A BEACON THAT AMERICANS 

1205
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:59,069
AND ALL OF US ENGAGED IN PUBLIC 

1206
00:38:59,069 --> 00:38:59,737
LIFE HAVE TO MOVE TOWARD. 

1207
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,005
>> LET'S PUT THAT QUESTION TO 

1208
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:01,672
NANCY CORDIS, WHO IS 

1209
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:02,272
ACCOMPANIED BY SENATOR. 

1210
00:39:02,272 --> 00:39:03,641
JEFF FLAKE OF ARIZONA.  

1211
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:06,343
>> Reporter: SENATOR. 

1212
00:39:06,343 --> 00:39:07,545
FLAKE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR 

1213
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:08,879
JOINING US TODAY,  YOU HAVE 

1214
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:11,015
BEEN SUCH AN INTEGRAL PART OF 

1215
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,349
ALL OF THESE MEMORIAL SERVICES 

1216
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:15,786
THIS WEEK AND SO I GUESS I WILL 

1217
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:17,354
START BY ASKING YOU WHAT HAS 

1218
00:39:17,354 --> 00:39:18,355
STRUCK YOU MOST ABOUT THE 

1219
00:39:18,355 --> 00:39:22,626
OUTPOURING WE HAVE SEEN FROM 

1220
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:24,195
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE, FROM 

1221
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,463
PUBLIC OFFICIALS TO PEOPLE WHO 

1222
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:27,498
HAVE NEVER MET THE SENATOR.  

1223
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:29,133
>> WE ARE NOT SURPRISED AT THE 

1224
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:32,136
OUTPOURING FROM HIS COLLEAGUES. 

1225
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,337
EVERYBODY LOVED JOHN. 

1226
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:35,906
ON EITHER SIDE OF THE AISLE, 

1227
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:36,807
WHETHER THEY AGREED WITH HIM 

1228
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:37,408
ALWAYS OR NOT. 

1229
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:40,678
BUT WHAT HAS JUST BEEN 

1230
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:41,879
COMPLETELY MIND BLOWING IS THE 

1231
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:42,680
REACTION ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 

1232
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,682
IT IS AS IF THEY ARE WANTING TO 

1233
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:47,518
REMEMBER POLITICS THIS WAY. 

1234
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:50,688
WHEN PEOPLE SAW THE HUMANITY ON 

1235
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:54,725
THE OTHER SIDE AND I THINK THAT 

1236
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,560
IS WHY THIS WEEK HAS BEEN SO 

1237
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,262
SPECIAL. 

1238
00:39:58,262 --> 00:39:59,597
I THINK IT HAS BLOWN US ALL 

1239
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:01,432
AWAY WITH THE REACTION. 

1240
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:02,967
>> Reporter: HE WAS IN SO MANY 

1241
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:04,068
WAYS AN INSPIRATION TO YOU WHEN 

1242
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,270
YOU CAME TO THE SENATE SIX 

1243
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,671
YEARS AGO, PROBABLY EVEN BEFORE 

1244
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:08,706
THAT BUT DO YOU THINK SOMEONE 

1245
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:12,943
LIKE JOHN McCAIN WITH HIS 

1246
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:13,476
POLITICAL PROFILE, VERY 

1247
00:40:13,476 --> 00:40:14,378
CONSERVATIVE ON SOME ISSUES BUT 

1248
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:15,412
WILLING TO WORK ON OTHER 

1249
00:40:15,412 --> 00:40:17,848
ISSUES, COULD GET IN -- COULD 

1250
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:19,283
GET ELECTED IN ARIZONA RIGHT 

1251
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:19,483
NOW? 

1252
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:21,285
>> NOT RIGHT NOW. 

1253
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:23,320
IT WON'T ALWAYS BE THIS WAY BUT 

1254
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,288
RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO POLITICAL 

1255
00:40:25,288 --> 00:40:29,026
REWARD FOR DOING WHAT JOHN 

1256
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:30,493
McCAIN DID, REACHING ACROSS THE 

1257
00:40:30,493 --> 00:40:31,629
AISLE. 

1258
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:34,632
AND NOT DEMONIZING THE OTHER 

1259
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:35,232
SIDE. 

1260
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:36,767
ALL THE INCENTIVES ARE WRONG BY 

1261
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:37,034
NOW. 

1262
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:38,602
BUT IT WON'T ALWAYS BE THAT 

1263
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:39,303
WAY. 

1264
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:42,206
ANGER AND RESENTMENT ARE NOT A 

1265
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:42,673
GOVERNING PHILOSOPHY. 

1266
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:44,808
SOONER OR LATER THE VOTERS WILL 

1267
00:40:44,808 --> 00:40:46,944
AGAIN VALUE SOMEBODY LIKE JOHN 

1268
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,312
McCAIN. 

1269
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:51,081
WHO STANDS ON PRINCIPLE BUT 

1270
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:52,082
UNDERSTANDS THAT YOU NEED TO 

1271
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:53,183
WORK WITH THE OTHER SIDE, 

1272
00:40:53,183 --> 00:40:54,818
SOMEBODY WHO CAN FORGIVE HIS 

1273
00:40:54,818 --> 00:40:58,288
VIETNAM TORMENTORS AND 

1274
00:40:58,288 --> 00:41:02,359
TORTURERS, I THINK THAT TELLS 

1275
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:03,794
US WE CAN CERTAINLY FORGIVE 

1276
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,796
EACH OTHER FOR LITTLE OFFENSES. 

1277
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,031
AND WORK TOGETHER IN THE 

1278
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:07,264
SENATE. 

1279
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:09,065
>> Reporter: AND YET WE NO -- 

1280
00:41:09,065 --> 00:41:15,539
KNOW THAT HE PERSONALLY WAS 

1281
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:16,540
DISAPPOINTED IN THE TENOR OF 

1282
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,775
THE GOP PRIMARY AND ARIZONA FOR 

1283
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:18,876
YOUR SEAT BECAUSE YOU ARE 

1284
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:20,110
RETIRING AT THE END OF THIS 

1285
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,779
TERM AND HE WAS FRUSTRATED THAT 

1286
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:23,347
THE DEBATE WAS NOT CONDUCTED 

1287
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:25,883
ALONG THE LINES THAT HE FELT WAS

1288
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:28,953
OF THE STANDARD OF SOMEONE WHO 

1289
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:30,487
WANTED TO BE A SENATOR. 

1290
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:34,458
>> IT IS NOT JUST THIS RACE, 

1291
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:37,695
IT'S BEEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 

1292
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:38,696
IT IS DISAPPOINTING BUT IT 

1293
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:39,930
WON'T ALWAYS BE THIS WAY. 

1294
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,498
>> Reporter: WHAT GIVES YOU 

1295
00:41:41,498 --> 00:41:42,867
THAT FAITH? 

1296
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:44,001
WHAT GIVES YOU THE SENSE THAT 

1297
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:47,004
THIS IS GOING TO CHANGE? 

1298
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,238
>> I THINK WE BOTH FELT THIS 

1299
00:41:48,238 --> 00:41:48,572
WAY. 

1300
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:49,840
JOHN AND I SAT DOWN A FEW 

1301
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,275
MONTHS AGO FOR OVER AN HOUR AND 

1302
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:52,643
TALKED ABOUT ARIZONA POLITICS 

1303
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:54,945
AND POLITICIANS COME AND GONE. 

1304
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:56,347
AND HE TALKED ABOUT HIS 

1305
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,249
OPTIMISM THAT PEOPLE WOULD RISE 

1306
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:00,885
UP AGAIN AND THAT THEIR SERVICE 

1307
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:03,287
WOULD BE VALUED. 

1308
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:05,089
PEOPLE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE 

1309
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:06,390
OTHER SIDE. 

1310
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,558
WE HAVE NO CHOICE. 

1311
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:09,894
BIG ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO SOLVE

1312
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:11,629
THAT CAN ONLY BE SOLVED IF WE 

1313
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:14,465
REACH ACROSS THE AISLE. 

1314
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:15,899
I THINK THAT IS GOING TO FORCE 

1315
00:42:15,899 --> 00:42:17,001
US TOGETHER IF NOTHING ELSE. 

1316
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:18,335
AND I THINK WEEKS LIKE THIS 

1317
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:20,671
TEND TO REMIND PEOPLE WHAT 

1318
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:22,539
REALLY MATTERS. 

1319
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:26,210
AND WHEN YOU SEE THE OUTPOURING 

1320
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,445
FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE, I 

1321
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:29,547
THINK MAYBE IT WILL REMIND 

1322
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,882
PEOPLE OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO. 

1323
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,350
>> Reporter: THANK YOU FOR YOUR 

1324
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:37,020
OPTIMISM, SENATOR. 

1325
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:37,922
JEFF FLAKE OF ARIZONA. 

1326
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:38,422
MARGARET ? 

1327
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:42,393
>> THANK YOU NESTLC -- NANCY 

1328
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,429
>> AND HERE IS THE MOTORCADE 

1329
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:46,563
PROCEEDING TO THE NATIONAL 

1330
00:42:46,563 --> 00:42:47,897
CATHEDRAL AND THE NATION'S 

1331
00:42:47,897 --> 00:42:49,400
CAPITAL. 

1332
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,603
WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING WHO IS 

1333
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:54,037
GATHERED TO HONOR SENATOR. 

1334
00:42:54,037 --> 00:42:55,472
McCAIN INSIDE THAT CHURCH AS HE 

1335
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:57,107
AND HIS FAMILY  NOW BEGIN TO 

1336
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:58,475
ARRIVE. 

1337
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:00,511
YOU HEARD SENATOR. 

1338
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:03,480
FLAKE  STRIKE AN OPTIMISTIC 

1339
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,481
TONE. 

1340
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:06,984
IT'S A HOPEFUL ONE BUT IN MANY 

1341
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:11,755
WAYS WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE 

1342
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:12,990
PAST TWO YEARS IS THIS REVOLT 

1343
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:13,791
AGAINST THE ESTABLISHMENT. 

1344
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:17,127
>> REVOLTING AGAINST THE EXACT 

1345
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:18,162
KIND OF REPUBLICAN THAT JOHN 

1346
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:20,497
McCAIN AND JEFF FLAKE BOTH ARE, 

1347
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:21,498
PUBLICLY SPEAKING OUT AGAINST 

1348
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:22,732
THE PRESIDENT IN BOOKS AND 

1349
00:43:22,732 --> 00:43:25,035
SPEECHES, FLAKE ONE OF THE MOST 

1350
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:26,369
HUMBLE KINDEST MEMBERS OF THE 

1351
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:27,771
SENATE. 

1352
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,173
I WAS AT A NUCLEAR PLANT IN 

1353
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:33,744
ARIZONA LAST MAY AND HE TOLD 

1354
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:34,878
THIS ROOMFUL OF WORKERS A STORY 

1355
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:35,879
ABOUT BEING THE OTHER SENATOR 

1356
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:36,914
FROM ARIZONA, THAT THEY BOARDED 

1357
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:38,015
A FLIGHT HOME TO PHOENIX 

1358
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:39,249
TOGETHER AND HE SAT DOWN AND 

1359
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:40,584
THIS WOMAN SAID DID YOU SEE 

1360
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:41,985
WHO'S UP FRONT? 

1361
00:43:41,985 --> 00:43:43,420
OH MY GOSH, OH MY GOSH JOHN 

1362
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,621
McCAIN IS ON THE PLANE. 

1363
00:43:44,621 --> 00:43:46,490
AND HE SAID OH, YES HE IS. 

1364
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,092
AND THE WOMAN LOOKS AT HIM AND 

1365
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:56,133
SAYS WHERE HAVE I SEEN YOU? 

1366
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,768
AND THE MAN IN FRONT OF THE TWO 

1367
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:58,869
PEOPLE, IN FRONT OF THE 

1368
00:43:58,869 --> 00:43:59,136
SENATOR. 

1369
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,071
AND THE WOMAN SAYS  HEY LADY, 

1370
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:02,406
THAT IS YOUR OTHER SENATOR FROM 

1371
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:03,607
ARIZONA, THAT'S WHY HE LOOKS SO 

1372
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:03,873
FAMILIAR. 

1373
00:44:03,873 --> 00:44:04,942
SO HE KNEW HIS PLACE. 

1374
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:08,479
>> THE OTHER SENATOR. 

1375
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,213
>> YES, HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF 

1376
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:12,583
TO BE THE OTHER SENATOR FROM 

1377
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:13,450
ARIZONA. 

1378
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,685
>> AS NANCY ALLUDED TO IN OUR 

1379
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:16,487
CONVERSATION, BOTH OF THE SEATS 

1380
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:20,591
HAVE BEEN OPENED. 

1381
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:22,626
>> THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE 

1382
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:24,061
PRESIDENT, WE ARE GOING TO SEE 

1383
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:32,603
STARTING NEXT WEEK A SUPREME 

1384
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:33,671
COURT NOMINEE THAT WILL 

1385
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:34,705
ENCOURAGE ALL OF THE PEOPLE IN 

1386
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:35,806
THE SENATE TO REVERT TO THAT 

1387
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:36,406
STRUCTURE THAT SENATOR. 

1388
00:44:36,406 --> 00:44:37,941
FLAKE WAS TALKING ABOUT,  THAT 

1389
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:38,641
ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO BEHAVE IN 

1390
00:44:38,641 --> 00:44:40,377
A WAY THAT IS NOT BIPARTISAN. 

1391
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:41,512
AND THAT IS WHY JOHN McCAIN, 

1392
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,779
WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT REGULAR 

1393
00:44:42,779 --> 00:44:46,350
ORDER, AND I KNOW ABOUT THIS 

1394
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,184
FROM COVERING THE SENATE, WHAT 

1395
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:54,324
IS REGULAR ORDER, IT'S A SYSTEM 

1396
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:54,825
OF DOING THINGS. 

1397
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:55,959
A STRUCTURE THAT FORCES PEOPLE 

1398
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:56,326
TO COMPROMISE. 

1399
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:57,361
WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY THAT 

1400
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,195
STRUCTURE AND EVERYBODY HAS 

1401
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,096
THEIR SELF INTEREST NOT TO 

1402
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:00,030
COMPROMISE, THE SYSTEM DOESN'T 

1403
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,431
FORCE YOU TO GET IN THE MIDDLE. 

1404
00:45:01,431 --> 00:45:02,232
A FORMER COLLEAGUE OF MINE 

1405
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:04,268
DAVID PLOTZ DESCRIBED, TALK TO 

1406
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:10,741
McCAIN ABOUT BOXING ONE TIME. 

1407
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:11,575
BOXING IS FIGHTING BUT THERE 

1408
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:12,176
ARE RULES. 

1409
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:13,177
YOU DON'T HIT BELOW THE BELT, 

1410
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:14,611
YOU DON'T KICK THE GUY IN THE 

1411
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:16,013
SHINS AND HE THOUGHT THAT WAS A 

1412
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:17,447
NICE METAPHOR FOR THE WAY JOHN 

1413
00:45:17,447 --> 00:45:18,248
McCAIN BELIEVED YOU SHOULD KEEP 

1414
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:18,882
THE RULES. 

1415
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,083
SO THAT YOU CAN THEN HAVE A 

1416
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:21,318
REALLY GOOD FIGHT AND AT THE 

1417
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:22,719
END OF THE FIGHT TO FIGURE 

1418
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:23,119
SOMETHING OUT. 

1419
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:24,388
THAT IS WHY HE WAS SO FOCUSED 

1420
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,923
ON THE ORDER OF THINGS, BECAUSE 

1421
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:27,024
THE ORDER IS WHAT ALLOWS THE 

1422
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:29,893
COMPROMISE TO HAPPEN. 

1423
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,062
>> IN LATE 2012 THERE WAS A 

1424
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:36,600
PROPOSAL AMONG SENATORS TO 

1425
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,203
FILIBUSTER, AND HE SAID OF A 

1426
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:40,537
SENATOR WANTS TO BLOCK 

1427
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:41,805
LEGISLATION HE OR SHE SHOULD GO 

1428
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:43,540
TO THE FLOOR AND VOICE THEIR 

1429
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:44,408
OBJECTION. 

1430
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:48,111
IT WASN'T THAT YOU WERE GOING 

1431
00:45:48,111 --> 00:45:49,746
TO WIN THE FIGHT BUT AT LEAST 

1432
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:50,747
YOU WOULD HAVE THE CONVERSATION 

1433
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:52,716
AND IF IT DIDN'T GO THAT WAY SO 

1434
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:54,518
BE IT. 

1435
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:56,153
>> THAT OF COURSE WAS PART OF 

1436
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:57,087
THE FRUSTRATION THAT HE VOICED 

1437
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:57,888
AROUND HIS DECISION TO VOTE, 

1438
00:45:57,888 --> 00:45:59,223
THE THUMBS DOWN IN THE MIDDLE 

1439
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:00,691
OF THE NIGHT, ON THE 

1440
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:03,193
PRESIDENT'S ATTEMPT TO REPEAL 

1441
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:06,230
WHAT IS OFTEN CALLED OBAMA CARE.

1442
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:07,064
THAT THERE WASN'T REGULAR 

1443
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:09,266
ORDER, THERE WAS IN THE PROCESS,

1444
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,300
THERE WASN'T AN ACTUAL 

1445
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,135
CONVERSATION TO BE HAD. 

1446
00:46:12,135 --> 00:46:13,503
TO TALK THROUGH A VERY 

1447
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,304
SIGNIFICANT DECISION THAT HE 

1448
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:17,174
FELT WAS BEING MADE. 

1449
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:19,810
>> BUT JOHN McCAIN, JOE BIDEN, 

1450
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:21,344
THE PEOPLE FROM THAT PARTICULAR 

1451
00:46:21,344 --> 00:46:24,882
GENERATION, THEY COULD GO OUT 

1452
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:26,216
THERE AND HAVE A KNOCKDOWN DRAG 

1453
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:27,517
OUT AND THEN WALK OFF THE 

1454
00:46:27,517 --> 00:46:29,887
SENATE FLOOR AND LEAVE ALL THE 

1455
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,588
BAD RHETORIC AND STUFF ON THE 

1456
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:32,456
SENATE FLOOR. 

1457
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,057
McCAIN HIMSELF WOULD TELL ABOUT 

1458
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:37,728
WHEN HE AND KENNEDY, TED 

1459
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:38,929
KENNEDY, WOULD GO AT IT AND HE 

1460
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:44,635
SAID ONE DAY WE JUST RAN THESE 

1461
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,636
TWO FRESHMEN OFF THAT HAD 

1462
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:46,637
STARTED THE DEBATE OUT THERE 

1463
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,038
AND WE WENT AT IT AND WALKED 

1464
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:50,674
OFF THE FLOOR AND TED PUT HIS 

1465
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:52,109
ARM AROUND ME AND SAID BOY, WE 

1466
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:53,410
REALLY PUT ONE ON FOR THEM 

1467
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:54,144
TODAY, DIDN'T WE JOHN? 

1468
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,146
AND THAT WAS WHAT YOU LIKED AND 

1469
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,180
WHAT ATTRACTED YOU TO THE 

1470
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:02,052
PEOPLE OF THAT DAY. 

1471
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:03,520
>> THEY KNEW THAT WHILE THEY 

1472
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,621
MIGHT BE FIGHTING LIKE CATS AND 

1473
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:05,856
DOGS TODAY OVER ONE THING 

1474
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:06,857
TOMORROW THEY MIGHT BE WORKING 

1475
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:08,125
ON SOMETHING TOGETHER AND LIFE 

1476
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:08,592
WAS LONG. 

1477
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:09,793
THERE WAS A CONTINUITY AND YOU 

1478
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:10,827
HAD TO RECOGNIZE THAT. 

1479
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:12,863
IT WASN'T ALWAYS ABOUT THE NEXT 

1480
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:14,731
NEWS CYCLE, YOU NEEDED THEM FOR 

1481
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:16,500
LONG CYCLED AHEAD. 

1482
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,334
>> RELATIONSHIPS IN THE SENATE 

1483
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:18,769
ARE ALWAYS TRANSACTIONAL. 

1484
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:20,137
YESTERDAY'S OPPONENT IS 

1485
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:26,243
TOMORROW'S MOST CRITICAL ALLY. 

1486
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:27,044
>> YOU HEARD SENATOR. 

1487
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:27,844
McCONNELL YESTERDAY SAY THAT 

1488
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:28,779
McCAIN BROUGHT AN INTENSITY TO 

1489
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:29,947
THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS , I WANT 

1490
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:31,415
TO GO BACK TO THE CATHEDRAL NOW 

1491

CATHEDRAL. 

1496
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:42,926
NANCY, WHO ARE YOU SEEING AND 

1497
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:45,762

>> Reporter: A VERY SOLEMN 

1499
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:48,198
SCENE AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE

CATHEDRAL MARGARET, THE HEARSE 

1501
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,034
HAS PULLED UP AS YOU SEE AT THE

00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,469
FRONT DOOR, THERE IS A MILITARY 

1503
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:57,507
HONOR GUARD WAITING HERE TO 

1504
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:58,742
REMOVE THE CASKET FROM THE

00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:00,344
HEARSE AND CARRY IT INTO THE 

1506
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:00,644
CATHEDRAL. 

1507
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:01,945
THE GUESTS OF COURSE HAVE 

1508
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:04,147
ALREADY ARRIVED AND HAVE BEEN 

1509
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:08,785
WAITING THIS MOMENT, A MOMENT 

1510
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:09,919
THAT WE HAVE SEEN PLAY OUT 

1511
00:48:09,919 --> 00:48:11,355
SEVERAL TIMES THIS WEEK NOW, AT 

1512
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:14,791
A CHURCH IN NORTH PHOENIX, AT 

1513
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:16,025
THE ARIZONA STATE CAPITOL IN 

1514
00:48:16,025 --> 00:48:18,528
PHOENIX, SO MUCH RESPECT BEING 

1515
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:22,532
PAID TO THIS MAN WHO WAS NOT 

1516
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:23,734
JUST A SENATOR. 

1517
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,668
BUT THE BEARER OF A FAMILY 

1518
00:48:25,668 --> 00:48:29,306
LEGACY IN THE U.S. NAVY AND WHO 

1519
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:32,442
LOVED THE MILITARY SO MUCH. 

1520
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:38,048
EVEN AFTER HE SERVED, EVEN 

1521
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:38,649
AFTER HE CAME BACK FROM 

1522
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:39,549
VIETNAM, SERVED AS A NAVY 

1523
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:39,983
LIAISON. 

1524
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:41,518
WHEN HE ENTERED CONGRESS HE WAS 

1525
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:43,253
A MEMBER OF THE SENATE ARMS 

1526
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,589
SERVICES COMMITTEE FOR DECADES. 

1527
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:46,890
HE LED IT FOR THE LAST THREE 

1528
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:48,925
YEARS OF HIS LIFE. 

1529
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:49,960
THE MILITARY WAS SO INCREDIBLY 

1530
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,161
IMPORTANT TO HIM AS YOU'VE 

1531
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:53,563
HEARD BOB TALKING ABOUT TODAY. 

1532
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:59,703
BUT ALSO, GOVERNMENT WASTE WAS 

1533
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:00,904
IMPORTANT TO HIM AS WELL AND IT 

1534
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:02,305
WAS IMPORTANT TO HIM THAT THE 

1535
00:49:02,305 --> 00:49:03,306
MILITARY HAD WHAT IT NEEDED,

1536
00:49:03,306 --> 00:49:04,541
BUT ALSO THAT THE MILITARY AND 

1537
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:05,342
OTHER PARTS OF THE GOVERNMENT 

1538
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:06,576
DIDN'T WASTE THE MONEY THAT 

1539
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:07,444
THEY HAD. 

1540
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:12,582
>> WE DON'T WANT TO CANONIZE 

1541
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:14,284
THE SENATOR EITHER. 

1542
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:17,187
>> AND HE WANTED -- HE WOULDN'T 

1543
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:20,324
WANT US TO EITHER. 

1544
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:21,224
>> I HEAR NANCY LAUGHING THERE 

1545
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:22,359
BUT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT, YOU'VE 

1546
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:26,496
HAD A GREAT DESCRIPTOR, YOU SAID

1547
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:27,931
HE HAD SOME SCUFF MARKS ON HIS 

1548
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:29,266
LEGACY AND HE WAS OPEN ABOUT 

1549
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:29,466
THEM. 

1550
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,935
>> WHICH IS ITSELF RARE, THAT 

1551
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:33,370
POLITICIANS ADMIT MISTAKES. 

1552
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:36,239
HE SOMETIMES WOULD SAY HERE, 

1553
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:37,641
COME SIT DOWN AND LET ME TELL 

1554
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,876
YOU ABOUT ALL OF MY MISTAKES. 

1555
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:41,011
HIS VIEW WAS, AND THAT'S WHAT 

1556
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:46,883
MADE HIS CHARACTER DURABLE, IT 

1557
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:48,418
WAS NOT JUST THIS THING SET OFF 

1558
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:49,553
IN A CASE THAT EVERYONE IS 

1559
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:50,187
SUPPOSED TO ADMIRE. 

1560
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:51,388
IT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN 

1561
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:52,522
OUT THERE AND HAD BEEN BEATEN 

1562
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:52,722
UP. 

1563
00:49:52,722 --> 00:49:54,524
IT HAD BEEN FIRST IN THE 5 1/2 

1564
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:55,559
YEARS HE WOULD TELL ABOUT WHERE 

1565
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:56,993
HE LET HIMSELF DOWN AND HIS 

1566
00:49:56,993 --> 00:49:58,195
COUNTRY DOWN DURING HIS TIME IN 

1567
00:49:58,195 --> 00:49:58,495
CAPTIVITY. 

1568
00:49:58,495 --> 00:49:59,429
BUT THEN ON LEGISLATION AND IN 

1569
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:02,966
BATTLES WHEN HE WAS TOO HOT 

1570
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:04,101
TEMPERED OR TWO SHORT TEMPERED 

1571
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:08,839
OR WHEN HE BORE A GRUDGE. 

1572
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:09,940
BUT HE WAS CONSTANTLY TRYING TO 

1573
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,475
GET ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THAT, 

1574
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:12,609
TRYING TO GET BACK IN THE 

1575
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:13,810
GROUPS OF THE STANDARD THAT HE 

1576
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:14,411
TRIED TO MAINTAIN. 

1577
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:18,081
AND THAT IS THE HUMAN THING. 

1578
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:19,483
PEOPLE ARE COMPLEX AND HE WAS 

1579
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:20,517
CERTAINLY QUITE COMPLEX AND HE 

1580
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:21,318
WAS ALWAYS LOOKING AT HIS 

1581
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:22,886
COMPLEXITIES AND TRYING TO MAKE 

1582
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:23,587
IT BETTER. 

1583
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:24,621
AND EVEN HIS BLIND SPOTS THAT 

1584
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:25,622
HIS FRIENDS WOULD RECOGNIZE 

1585
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:27,157
THAT HE STILL HAD UNTIL THE 

1586
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:27,557
END. 

1587
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:28,458
THEY WERE ONES THAT HE WOULD 

1588
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:29,693
RECOGNIZE AND THEN MAYBE JUST 

1589
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,294
NOT BE ABLE TO FIX BUT THAT WAS 

1590
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:32,529
ABSOLUTELY A KEY PART OF HIS 

1591
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:32,829
CHARACTER. 

1592
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:36,900
>> BUT HE WOULD RARELY GET MAD. 

1593
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,235
I MEAN HE ALWAYS LAUGHED ABOUT 

1594
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:39,769
IT LATER BUT THERE'S NO 

1595
00:50:39,769 --> 00:50:41,938
QUESTION ABOUT THAT. 

1596
00:50:41,938 --> 00:50:43,240
AND HE WOULD SAY THINGS THAT HE 

1597
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:43,874
SHOULD NOT HAVE SAID. 

1598
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,909
BUT IN THE HEAT OF BATTLE, BUT 

1599
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:48,945
HE WAS THE FIRST TO SAY I WILL 

1600
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:49,846
NEVER BE ELECTED MS. 

1601
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:50,680
CONGENIALITY OF THE UNITED 

1602
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:50,913
STATES. 

1603
00:50:50,913 --> 00:50:52,816
BUT HE MANAGED TO GET BY. 

1604
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:57,821
>> IRA REMEMBER -- I REMOVER 

1605
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:59,356
ONCE SEEING A PROFILE OF HIM 

1606
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:01,725
AND ASKING HIM DID YOU -- DO 

1607
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:06,363
YOU TAKE MEDICATION FOR YOUR 

1608
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:07,464
ANGER AND HE DIDN'T APPRECIATE 

1609
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:07,831
THAT QUESTION. 

1610
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:08,899
BUT HIS COLLEAGUES WHEN HE RAN 

1611
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,400
FOR PRESIDENT THAT DIDN'T LIKE 

1612
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,735
HIM SAID THAT HE LACKS THE 

1613
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:12,902
TEMPERAMENT TO BE PRESIDENT 

1614
00:51:12,902 --> 00:51:15,005
BECAUSE HE GETS INTO THESE 

1615
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:18,808
FIGHTS, HE'S VIOLENT. 

1616
00:51:18,808 --> 00:51:20,744
OR NOT VIOLENT, HE'S PASSIONATE.

1617
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:24,948
WHICH LEFT SOME BRUISES. 

1618
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:26,016
>> FOR THOSE WHO ASCRIBE THAT 

1619
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:27,117
TO HIS TIME IN CAPTIVITY, LAST 

1620
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:28,952
WEEKEND WE WERE TALKING TO 

1621
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:30,853
KAREN TOLD T WHO HAD WRITTEN AN 

1622
00:51:30,853 --> 00:51:36,193
IN-DEPTH OBITUARY ABOUT JOHN 

1623
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:37,527
McCAIN AND SHE SAID NO, HIS 

1624
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:38,762
MOTHER SAID WHEN HE WAS A 

1625
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,063
TODDLER HE WOULD GET SO MAD HE 

1626
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:42,132
WOULD HOLD HIS BREATH UNTIL HE 

1627
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:43,633
PASSED OUT LITERALLY. 

1628
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:45,302
AND THAT THE NAVY DOCTOR TOLD 

1629
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:46,937
HER TO DUMP HIM IN COLD WATER 

1630
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,706
TO GET HIM TO STOP. 

1631
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:51,875
HE WAS STUBBORN. 

1632
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:55,345
>> AND REMEMBER, BEING CALLED A 

1633
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:57,813
JERK BY HIM IN THE HALLS OF 

1634
00:51:57,813 --> 00:51:59,649
CONGRESS WAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST 

1635
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:03,086
HONORS THAT A CONGRESSIONAL 

1636
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:04,020
MEMBER COULD EARN AND IT 

1637
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:04,855
SOMETIMES MEANT HE WOULDN'T 

1638
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:06,356
TALK TO YOU FOR A FEW DAYS OR 

1639
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:09,159
WEEKS BUT I CAN -- I CAN RECALL 

1640
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:17,234
SOME PEOPLE IN THAT SITUATION. 

1641
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:20,971
>> BUT IN THE OTHER END OF THAT 

1642
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:28,678
HE WAS A GREAT KNEELER. 

1643
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:32,849
HE WAS ALWAYS ASKING ME IF I WAS

1644
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:34,150
-- IF I HAD INVESTIGATED 

1645
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:34,550
ASSISTED LIVING. 

1646
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:35,986
WE WERE THESE TWO OLD GUYS IN 

1647
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,053
THE HALLS OF CONGRESS AND 

1648
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:39,089
DURING THAT 2000 CAMPAIGN. 

1649
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:42,892
>> IT LOOKS LIKE JOHN KELLY AND 

1650
00:52:42,892 --> 00:52:46,596
JIM MATUS. 

1651
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:47,797
>> I REMEMBER IN THAT CAMPAIGN 

1652
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:49,032
HE WOULD POINT BACK TO US AND 

1653
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:50,033
SAY WILL THAT BUNCH OF 

1654
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:51,668
COMMUNISTS BACK THERE, BUT HE 

1655
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:52,102
WAS KIDDING. 

1656
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:54,771
AND EVERYBODY KNEW HE WAS. 

1657
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:57,340
>> HE REFERRED TO THE STAFFERS 

1658
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:01,177
THAT WORKED FOR HIM, THE BEST 

1659
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:02,612
YOU CAN GET FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE 

1660
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:03,713
OUT ON WORK RELEASE PROGRAMS. 

1661
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:05,448
>> [ LAUGHTER ] 

1662
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:09,452
>> AND YOU NO, WHILE WE ARE ON 

1663
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:14,424
THE McCAIN HUMOR, I WENT BACK 

1664
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:15,625
WHEN I WAS WRITING ABOUT HIM A 

1665
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:17,060
FEW YEARS AGO AND LISTENED TO 

1666
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,094
THE TOWN HALLS AND THEY WOULD 

1667
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:19,696
ALWAYS BEGIN WITH 15 MINUTES OF 

1668
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:20,497
BASICALLY CATSKILL HUMOR, GOING 

1669
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:21,531
BACK TO WHEN HE WAS A 

1670
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:22,765
STORYTELLER IN ILLINOIS -- 

1671
00:53:22,765 --> 00:53:23,967
HANOI. 

1672
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:25,201
ENTERTAINING PEOPLE WITH ALL OF 

1673
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:28,004
THAT NEEDLING AND JOKING. 

1674
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:29,506
HE WOULD SAY COME DOWN FRONT 

1675
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:36,313
FOR THE SPEECH AND HE WOULD SAY 

1676
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:37,947
COME ON UP YOU CAN TAKE A NAP 

1677
00:53:37,947 --> 00:53:38,748
APPEAR AND WE WON'T DISTURB 

1678
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:39,182
YOU. 

1679
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:41,551
>> HE DIDN'T TO TAKE HIMSELF 

1680
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:42,118
TOO SERIOUSLY.

1681
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:51,695
>> THERE ARE SEVERAL THAT WE 

1682
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:52,195
CAN'T REPEAT. 

1683
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:57,167
>> AND I WANT TO SAY, THIS IS 

1684
00:53:57,167 --> 00:53:57,701
THE PUBLIC FUNERAL. 

1685
00:53:57,701 --> 00:53:58,702
THERE WILL BE A PRIVATE 

1686
00:53:58,702 --> 00:53:59,935
MEMORIAL SERVICE TOMORROW AT 

1687
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:04,574
ANNAPOLIS WHERE THE NAVAL 

1688
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:05,375
ACADEMY IS. 

1689
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:06,309
THE SENATOR ATTENDED IT MANY 

1690
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:07,811
YEARS AGO AS DID HIS FATHER AND 

1691
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:08,144
GRANDFATHER. 

1692
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:09,846
BUT TODAY THIS IS ABOUT 

1693
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:12,582
CELEBRATING HIS LIFE AND HE HAS 

1694
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:13,817
BROUGHT SOME PRETTY 

1695
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:15,285
DISTINGUISHED PEOPLE HERE 

1696
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:15,552
TOGETHER. 

1697
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:19,622
WE KNOW THAT SOME FORMER 

1698
00:54:19,622 --> 00:54:20,657
PRESIDENTS OF THIS COUNTRY OF 

1699
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:21,658
COURSE ARE GOING TO BE 

1700
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:22,058
EULOGIZING HIM. 

1701
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:23,059
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 

1702
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:24,661
FOREIGN LEADERS BUT THE TWO MEN 

1703
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:26,262
WHO QUASHED SENATOR. 

1704
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:28,498
McCAIN'S  BIDS TO BECOME 

1705
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:29,766
PRESIDENT HIMSELF, BARACK OBAMA 

1706
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:34,604
AND BEFORE THAT GEORGE W. BUSH, 

1707
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,206
ARE THERE AT THE CATHEDRAL AND 

1708
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:37,072
WILL BE DELIVERING EULOGIES. 

1709
00:54:37,072 --> 00:54:40,110
WE NO THEY ARE -- WE KNOW THEY 

1710
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,511
ARE INSIDE RIGHT NOW. 

1711
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:46,816
WE ARE LOOKING AT IVANKA TRUMP, 

1712
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:47,617
AND JARED KUSHNER, THE 

1713
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:48,585
PRESIDENT'S SON-IN-LAW AND  

1714
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:51,421
DAUGHTER. 

1715
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:54,357
>> AND THEY ARE SPEAKING WITH 

1716
00:54:54,357 --> 00:54:57,060
ONE OF HIS CLOSEST PARTNERS, IN 

1717
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:57,427
THE SENATE. 

1718
00:54:57,427 --> 00:55:02,799
>> I WAS GOING BACK AND LOOKING 

1719
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:03,500
AT McCAIN'S CONCESSION SPEECH 

1720
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,834
WHEN HE LOST IT TO PRESIDENT. 

1721
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:05,135
OBAMA.  

1722
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,970
IT IS ALL IN HERE. 

1723
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,338
HE TALKS ABOUT RIGHT OFF THE 

1724
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:10,540
TOP, I HAD THE HONOR OF CALLING 

1725
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:13,877
BARACK OBAMA, HE TALKED ABOUT 

1726
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:16,279
THE FACT THAT CANDIDATE OBAMA 

1727
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:21,351
COMMANDED HIS RESPECT FOR HIS 

1728
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:21,951
PERSEVERANCE, HE ADMIRED HIM 

1729
00:55:21,951 --> 00:55:22,552
AND COMMENDED HIM. 

1730
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:23,820
THIS IS IN THE FIRST TWO 

1731
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:24,220
PARAGRAPHS. 

1732
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:27,857
RECOGNIZING AFTER A BITTER FIGHT

1733
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:29,092
AND ONE IN WHICH HE EXPRESSED 

1734
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:30,527
AND BEHAVED IN ALL OF THOSE 

1735
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:31,327
WAYS WE WERE JUST TALKING 

1736
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,562
ABOUT, THAT VERY POINTED 

1737
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:34,764
BEHAVIOR HE COULD HAVE, BUT 

1738
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:35,699
IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED THAT HIS 

1739
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:38,335
DUTY AS THE DEFEATED WAS TO 

1740
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:39,669
HONOR AND RAISE UP AND COMMEND 

1741
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,204
IN PUBLIC THE PERSON WHO HAD 

1742
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:46,843
JUST ONE. 

1743
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,144
>> MY PRESIDENT, HE CALLED HIM. 

1744
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:49,379
>> IS RIGHT, HE CALLED IN MY 

1745
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:49,679
PRESIDENT. 

1746
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,114
THAT IS VERY MUCH A PART OF 

1747
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:51,314
HIM. 

1748
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:52,982
>> I NOTED, YOU REFERENCED THAT 

1749
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:55,552
CONCESSION SPEECH, ALSO IN THE 

1750
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:57,019
FINAL LETTER THAT THE SENATOR 

1751
00:55:57,019 --> 00:56:02,325
RELEASED, AT HIS TIME OF DEATH 

1752
00:56:02,325 --> 00:56:03,426
IT HAD ECHOES OF THAT, LITTLE 

1753
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:04,728
QUOTES FROM THAT, THE LAST 

1754
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:06,029
LINE, AMERICANS NEVER QUITS, WE 

1755
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,897
NEVER SURRENDER, WE NEVER HIDE 

1756
00:56:07,897 --> 00:56:11,935
FROM HISTORY, WE MAKE HISTORY. 

1757
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:13,937
DELIBERATE IN REFERENCING THAT. 

1758
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:16,639
I NO HIS FORMER COLLEAGUE MARK 

1759
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:20,043
SALTER AUTHORED IT. 

1760
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:25,415
>> WE SHOULD MENTION WHAT 

1761
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:28,585
LEADERS DO, THEY PULL OTHER 

1762
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:30,019
PEOPLE ALONG IN THEIR WAKE AND 

1763
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:32,989
IMPRESS THEIR WILL UPON THEM. 

1764
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:33,990
AND MARK SALTER CHANNELED KIND 

1765
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,525
OF THE CORE OF JOHN McCAIN, WHO 

1766
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:39,562
BY HIS HAIDA BY THE WAY WHEN 

1767
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:42,932
JOHN McCAIN WAS LEFT TO HIS OWN 

1768
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:47,871
DEVICES -- BY THE WAY WHEN JOHN 

1769
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,005
McCAIN WAS LED TO HIS OWN 

1770
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:50,006
DEVICES HE COULDN'T QUITE SELL 

1771
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:52,475
IT BUT MARK SALTER TOOK HIS 

1772
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:55,011
WORDS AND KIND OF SOLIDIFIED 

1773
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:57,213
THE THOUGHT PROCESS. 

1774
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:58,848
>> WE DO APPRECIATE THE FACT 

1775
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:01,785
THAT HE IS HAVING OBAMA AND 

1776
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:03,686
GEORGE W. BUSH SPEAK HERE. 

1777
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:06,589
THOSE CAMPAIGNS, THE 2000 

1778
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:07,624
CAMPAIGN WAS EVEN NASTIER. 

1779
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:09,058
THEN THE ONE WITH OBAMA. 

1780
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:11,828
AND THE FACT THAT HE COULD MOVE 

1781
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:13,296
PAST THAT AND UNDERSTAND THAT 

1782
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:15,331
THAT WAS IN THE PAST AND NOW WE 

1783
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:17,567
ARE IN THE FUTURE. 

1784
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,801
>> AND NASTY WITHIN HIS OWN 

1785
00:57:18,801 --> 00:57:19,369
PARTY. 

1786
00:57:19,369 --> 00:57:21,371
>> YES. 

1787
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:22,805
AND WHEN HE LOST I REMEMBER 

1788
00:57:22,805 --> 00:57:26,376
ASKING GEORGE McGOVERN ONCE, DO 

1789
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:29,312
YOU EVER GET OVER GETTING BEAT 

1790
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:30,513
WHEN YOU RUN FOR PRESIDENT AND 

1791
00:57:30,513 --> 00:57:31,848
HE SAID NO, YOU NEVER DO. 

1792
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:33,716
HE SAID YOU JUST NEVER GET PAST 

1793
00:57:33,716 --> 00:57:33,882
IT. 

1794
00:57:33,882 --> 00:57:35,418
McCAIN JUST WENT BACK TO WORK. 

1795
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:39,989
HE GOT OVER IT. 

1796
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:41,624
SURE, IT WOULD ALWAYS BE A PART 

1797
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:42,959
OF HIM BUT HE WENT RIGHT BACK 

1798
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,394
TO WORK AND IT WAS ALMOST LIKE 

1799
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:45,395
HIS THERAPY IN SOME WAYS. 

1800
00:57:45,395 --> 00:57:46,796
HE DIDN'T MISS A BEAT. 

1801
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:49,032
>> YOU CAN SEE THEIR FORMER 

1802
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:52,502
SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY 

1803
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:54,704
CLINTON INSIDE THE CATHEDRAL AS 

1804
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:58,541
WELL TO PAY HER RESPECTS. 

1805
00:57:58,541 --> 00:57:59,375
NANCY CORDIS IS OUTSIDE THE 

1806
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:00,577
CATHEDRAL AND NANCY I WAS 

1807
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:01,845
RECENTLY SPEAKING TO SENATOR. 

1808
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:06,282
TIM KANE,  HILLARY CLINTON'S 

1809
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:07,317
RUNNING MATE IN 2016 WHO SAID 

1810
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,018
JUST WHAT BOB WAS REFERENCING 

1811
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:10,787

1828

CONSIDERED HIM AS A RUNNING 

1829

1835
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:57,700

1837
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:00,703

IF JOHN McCAIN IS TRYING TO

00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:10,079
SEND US ANY MESSAGE, IT IS 

1840
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:10,980
SOMETHING THAT HE SAID ABOUT 

1841
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,081
MOE UDALL MANY YEARS AGO. 

1842
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:13,216
HE SAID WE DISAGREE IN POLITICS 

1843
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:13,916
BUT NOT IN LIFE. 

1844
00:59:13,916 --> 00:59:15,118

01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:35,250
THE VOICE YOU ARE HEARING WITH 

1992
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:41,390
THE OPENING PRAYER, MARION -- 

1993
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:41,690
REVEREND. 

1994
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:44,359
MARY AND EDGAR BOO DAY,  

1995
01:12:44,359 --> 01:12:44,827
BEGINNING THE CEREMONY.

1996
01:13:08,683 --> 01:13:13,055
OF COURSE HENRY KISSINGER, 

1997
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:14,423
FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE, 

1998
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:17,125
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER, 

1999
01:13:17,125 --> 01:13:18,227
SOMEONE WHOSE FATE WAS VERY 

2000
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:19,061
MUCH INTERTWINED WITH JOHN 

2001
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:20,329
McCAIN, HE OF COURSE NEGOTIATED 

2002
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:24,166
THE END TO COMBAT IN VIETNAM. 

2003
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:24,633
1973. 

2004
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:26,802
AND JOHN McCAIN RECALLS 

2005
01:13:26,802 --> 01:13:28,703
THANKING HIM AFTER THE FACT FOR 

2006
01:13:28,703 --> 01:13:31,874
NOT PERSONALLY REQUESTING HIS 

2007
01:13:31,874 --> 01:13:39,248
RELEASE. BEHIND HIM YOU SAW THE 

2008
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:40,149
REPUBLICAN SENATOR FROM SOUTH 

2009
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:40,783
CAROLINA, LINDSEY GRAHAM, 

2010
01:13:40,783 --> 01:13:41,884
LONGTIME FRIEND OF JOHN McCAIN. 

2011
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:49,424
ONE OF THE THREE AMIGOS AS HIS 

2012
01:13:49,424 --> 01:13:50,659
GOOD FRIENDS IN THE SENATE WERE 

2013
01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:50,892
CALLED. 

2014
01:13:50,892 --> 01:13:51,760
WE WERE TALKING EARLIER ABOUT 

2015
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:52,060
SENATOR. 

2016
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:52,694
LIEBERMAN AS WELL FROM 

2017
01:13:52,694 --> 01:13:53,094
CONNECTICUT.  

2018
01:13:53,094 --> 01:13:55,731
>> GIVEN THAT NAME BY GENERAL. 

2019
01:13:55,731 --> 01:13:56,932
BETRAY US ON ONE OF THEIR 

2020
01:13:56,932 --> 01:13:57,966
VISITS TO IRAQ,  WHICH WE 

2021
01:13:57,966 --> 01:13:59,368
HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT. 

2022
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:00,602
BUT McCAIN'S SUPPORT FOR 

2023
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:03,972
PRETORIUS AND MATUS WHO WERE 

2024
01:14:03,972 --> 01:14:07,910
THE ARCHITECTS OF THE SURGE OF 

2025
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:13,348
THE FINAL INCREASE IN TROOPS. 

2026
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:14,182
McCAIN THE STRONGEST ADVOCATE 

2027
01:14:14,182 --> 01:14:14,783
FOR THAT. 

2028
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:16,585
DURING THE 2008 CAMPAIGN WHEN 

2029
01:14:16,585 --> 01:14:17,419
THAT WAS QUITE AN UNPOPULAR 

2030
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:18,654
POSITION TO HOLD. 

2031
01:14:18,654 --> 01:14:20,021
EVEN WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN 

2032
01:14:20,021 --> 01:14:20,289
PARTY.

2033
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:49,318
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE HARD 

2034
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:50,018
ONE, HARD-FOUGHT BATTLES THAT 

2035
01:14:50,018 --> 01:14:53,722
HE'S BEEN THROUGH, GEORGE W 

2036
01:14:53,722 --> 01:14:55,156
BUSH AND JOHN McCAIN WENT HEAD-

2037
01:14:55,156 --> 01:14:56,458
TO-HEAD. 

2038
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:58,694
>> OH, THEY REALLY DID. 

2039
01:14:58,694 --> 01:15:01,897
AND IT JUST DISCOMBOBULATED THE 

2040
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:04,366
BUSH CAMPAIGN WHEN JOHN McCAIN 

2041
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:07,903
BEAT THEM IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. 

2042
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:08,770
IN 2008. 

2043
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:12,007
I REMEMBER GEORGE BUSH HAD BEEN 

2044
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:14,810
MY GUEST ON FACE THE NATION THE 

2045
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:16,845
SUNDAY BEFORE THE PRIMARY AND 

2046
01:15:16,845 --> 01:15:20,282
AFTERWARD HE SAID TO ME, HE SAID

2047
01:15:20,282 --> 01:15:21,617
BOB WE'RE NOT GOING TO JUST 

2048
01:15:21,617 --> 01:15:22,851
WIN, WE ARE GOING TO REALLY 

2049
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:23,619
WIN. 

2050
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:26,221
AND THEN McCAIN CAME ALONG AND 

2051
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:27,356
BEAT THEM. 

2052
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:29,157
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. 

2053
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:30,726
IT STUNNED THE WHOLE 

2054
01:15:30,726 --> 01:15:31,093
ESTABLISHMENT. 

2055
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:34,863
I THINK BUSH LATER SAID THAT IT 

2056
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:35,864
WAS THE BEST THING THAT 

2057
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:36,465
COULD'VE HAPPENED TO HIM 

2058
01:15:36,465 --> 01:15:37,733
BECAUSE THEY REALIZED THEY 

2059
01:15:37,733 --> 01:15:39,501
DIDN'T HAVE IT ONE. 

2060
01:15:39,501 --> 01:15:46,174
THE SAD PART OF IT WAS IS THAT 

2061
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:47,009
THE McCAIN CAMPAIGN REALLY 

2062
01:15:47,009 --> 01:15:48,010
TURNED NASTY WHEN THEY WENT TO 

2063
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:48,410
SOUTH CAROLINA. 

2064
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:49,444
I THINK BOTH CAMPAIGNS DID 

2065
01:15:49,444 --> 01:15:50,846
THINGS IN THOSE WEEKS THAT THEY 

2066
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:52,481
PROBABLY IN RETROSPECT WISH 

2067
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:54,249
THEY HADN'T DONE. 

2068
01:15:54,249 --> 01:15:56,151
BUT BUSH ALSO WENT ON TO WIN 

2069
01:15:56,151 --> 01:15:58,219
AND WENT ON TO WIN THE 

2070
01:15:58,219 --> 01:15:58,854
NOMINATION. 

2071
01:15:58,854 --> 01:16:05,027
BUT IT WAS REALLY REALLY MEAN. 

2072
01:16:05,027 --> 01:16:06,128
>> YES AND VERY PERSONAL ABOUT 

2073
01:16:06,128 --> 01:16:06,395
SENATOR. 

2074
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:07,462
McCAIN'S FAMILY, ABOUT HIS WAR 

2075
01:16:07,462 --> 01:16:07,762
SERVICE.  

2076
01:16:07,762 --> 01:16:09,364
IT GOT ABOUT AS NASTY AS IT CAN 

2077
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:10,599
GET IN THAT PERIOD BETWEEN WHEN 

2078
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:15,837
BUSH, BOB MENTIONED McCAIN, HE 

2079
01:16:15,837 --> 01:16:17,272
USED TO JOKE THAT HE WAS IN 2% 

2080
01:16:17,272 --> 01:16:18,473
OF THE POLLS WHEN HE STARTED 

2081
01:16:18,473 --> 01:16:20,075
THE NEW HAMPSHIRE WHICH MEANT 

2082
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:23,779
THAT IF YOU CONSIDER THE MARGIN 

2083
01:16:23,779 --> 01:16:24,980
OF ERROR HE MIGHT'VE BEEN IN 

2084
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:25,580
THE NEGATIVE TERRITORY. 

2085
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:29,451
HE CAME FROM THAT TINY SPACE, 

2086
01:16:29,451 --> 01:16:30,052
STOLE THE MONEY AND 

2087
01:16:30,052 --> 01:16:30,886
ESTABLISHMENT ENDORSEMENTS THAT 

2088
01:16:30,886 --> 01:16:32,120
GEORGE BUSH HAD AND GRIND IT 

2089
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:33,155
OUT WITH ALL THOSE TOWN HALLS 

2090
01:16:33,155 --> 01:16:34,456
AND ONE THEM AND HIS ARGUMENT 

2091
01:16:34,456 --> 01:16:37,192
WAS IF I CAN BEAT THE SYSTEM IN 

2092
01:16:37,192 --> 01:16:38,627
THIS I CAN BEAT IT IN 

2093
01:16:38,627 --> 01:16:38,927
WASHINGTON. 

2094
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:39,861
I CAN CHANGE THINGS IN 

2095
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:40,595
WASHINGTON. 

2096
01:16:40,595 --> 01:16:43,699
THAT FOR HIM, NEW HAMPSHIRE AND 

2097
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:44,499
THE PETERBOROUGH TOWN HALL 

2098
01:16:44,499 --> 01:16:46,535
WHERE IT ALL STARTED ALTHOUGH 

2099
01:16:46,535 --> 01:16:47,569
HE WAS A SENATOR FROM ARIZONA 

2100
01:16:47,569 --> 01:16:52,808
AND LOVED IT, AND LOVED SEDONA, 

2101
01:16:52,808 --> 01:16:54,242
HE HAD SOME NEW HAMPSHIRE IN 

2102
01:16:54,242 --> 01:16:55,043
HIM BECAUSE OF HIS EXPERIENCES 

2103
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:56,478
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, BOTH IN 2000 

2104
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:59,114
AND IN 2008. 

2105
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:00,315
>> BUT THEY REALLY, I DON'T 

2106
01:17:00,315 --> 01:17:01,750
THINK THIS IS OVERSTATING IT TO 

2107
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:04,786
SAY THAT IN LATER YEARS BUSH 

2108
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:06,120
AND McCAIN ACTUALLY BECAME 

2109
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:07,823
FRIENDS. 

2110
01:17:07,823 --> 01:17:08,690
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

2111
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:10,659
>> AND THEY WOULD TALK ON THE 

2112
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:12,627
PHONE. 

2113
01:17:12,627 --> 01:17:15,197
>> AND I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT, 

2114
01:17:15,197 --> 01:17:16,631
AND THE SURGE WAS PART OF IT. 

2115
01:17:16,631 --> 01:17:18,033
THE IRAQ WAR WAS NOT GOING WELL 

2116
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:20,035
AND BUSH WAS SO BACKED BY THAT 

2117
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:22,003
DECISION ABOUT WHETHER TO SEND 

2118
01:17:22,003 --> 01:17:24,506
MORE TROOPS THAT HE WAS 

2119
01:17:24,506 --> 01:17:26,274
GRINDING HIS TEETH AT NIGHT AND 

2120
01:17:26,274 --> 01:17:28,577
COULDN'T SLEEP. 

2121
01:17:28,577 --> 01:17:30,078
TO HAVE AN ALLY AND JOHN McCAIN 

2122
01:17:30,078 --> 01:17:31,413
TO SAY YOU SHOULD DO THIS, THIS 

2123
01:17:31,413 --> 01:17:35,584
IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO, IT 

2124
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:36,885
WAS AN ALLY AT A VERY IMPORTANT 

2125
01:17:36,885 --> 01:17:38,353
TIME WHEN A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE 

2126
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:39,454
DISTANCING THEMSELVES FROM THE 

2127
01:17:39,454 --> 01:17:40,722
PRESIDENT AND THE IRAQ WAR. 

2128
01:17:40,722 --> 01:17:42,824
>> AND HE DIDN'T LIKE TO TALK 

2129
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:44,226
ABOUT IT MUCH BUT HIS OWN SON 

2130
01:17:44,226 --> 01:17:48,930
WAS SERVING IN THAT WAR. 

2131
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:49,931
HE WOULD TELL THE STORY ABOUT 

2132
01:17:49,931 --> 01:17:51,333
HOW HIS SON WAS DIGGING A 

2133
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:52,367
DITCH, HE WAS ENLISTED AS A 

2134
01:17:52,367 --> 01:17:53,669
MARINE AND AN OFFICER CAME OUT 

2135
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:54,670
AND SAID MARINE YOUR FATHER 

2136
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:56,505
JUST WON THE PRIMARY. 

2137
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:58,006
AND HE STOPPED FOR A SECOND AND 

2138
01:17:58,006 --> 01:17:59,675
HE SAID GO BACK TO DIGGING. 

2139
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,476
[ LAUGHTER ] BUT IT WAS JUST 

2140
01:18:01,476 --> 01:18:03,111
SUCH A WORLD AWAY. 

2141
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:04,312
WITH HIS SON ON THE FRONT 

2142
01:18:04,312 --> 01:18:04,545
LINES. 

2143
01:18:04,545 --> 01:18:06,748
IT IS SUCH A STATEMENT TO STAND 

2144
01:18:06,748 --> 01:18:11,653
WITH THAT SURGE. 

2145
01:18:11,653 --> 01:18:12,788
>> THERE YOU SEE SENATOR. 

2146
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:13,688
BOB DOLE, THE 96 NOMINEE FOR 

2147
01:18:13,688 --> 01:18:16,024
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY  WHO WORE 

2148
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:17,325
A BRACELET WHEN THEY HAD 

2149
01:18:17,325 --> 01:18:19,161
BRACELETS FOR POWS IN VIETNAM, 

2150
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:20,395
HE WORE A BRACELET WHICH HE 

2151
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:22,230
LATER TOLD JOHN McCAIN THE POW 

2152
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:23,865
BRACELET THAT BOB DOLE WORE WAS 

2153
01:18:23,865 --> 01:18:26,468
JOHN McCAIN'S BRACELET.

2154
01:18:28,603 --> 01:18:33,575
>> BOB DOLE IS WHAT, MID-90s? 

2155
01:18:33,575 --> 01:18:35,811
I WOULD THINK. 

2156
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:38,814
>> HENRY KISSINGER IS ABOUT 95 

2157
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:39,481
YEARS OLD.

2158
01:18:43,718 --> 01:18:46,688
I MEAN THIS IS A GATHERING 

2159
01:18:46,688 --> 01:18:48,523
>> 95 I THINK. 

2160
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:57,966
>> STILL SO REMARKABLE TO SEE 

2161
01:18:57,966 --> 01:19:02,604
THESE THREE MARK TO HAVE AL GORE

2162
01:19:02,604 --> 01:19:05,240
JUST A FEW STEPS FROM GEORGE 

2163
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:07,909
BUSH AND TO SEE ALL -- OBAMA 

2164
01:19:07,909 --> 01:19:09,644
AND BUSH SPEAKING TO THEM.

2165
01:19:42,043 --> 01:19:43,111
>>> I REMEMBER READING HIS FACE 

2166
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:45,213
TURNED AS RED AS HIS TIED THE 

2167
01:19:45,213 --> 01:19:48,550
MOMENT AFTER McCAIN VOTED NO.  

2168
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:49,050

>> THEIR NAMES COME NEXT TO 

2171
01:19:57,559 --> 01:19:59,361
EACH OTHER BUT THERE WERE TIMES 

2172
01:19:59,361 --> 01:20:03,431

PRESIDENT  ESSENTIALLY SAID 

2178
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:09,204
WE'VE ALL BEEN CORRUPTED BY THE 

2179
01:20:09,204 --> 01:20:09,437
SYSTEM. 

2180
01:20:09,437 --> 01:20:16,478
BEING THINGS DON'T GET DONE 

2181
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:18,313
BECAUSE THE MONEY FORCES US TO 

2182
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:19,714
NOT ACT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF 

2183
01:20:19,714 --> 01:20:20,515
OUR COUNTRY, WHICH WAS 

2184
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:21,516

2188
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:25,887
MATTER. 

2189
01:20:25,887 --> 01:20:27,555
DIDN'T BELIEVE IN THE SAME.  

2190
01:20:27,555 --> 01:20:28,523
IN CAMPAIGN-FINANCE, THEY COULD 

2191
01:20:28,523 --> 01:20:29,357
NOT HAVE BEEN STRONGER 

2192
01:20:29,357 --> 01:20:33,361
ADVERSARIES ON THAT ISSUE. 

2193
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:34,162

WE DIDN'T GO ON A DATE BUT WE 

2201
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:54,983
TALKED ABOUT EVEN POSSIBLY 

2202
01:20:54,983 --> 01:20:57,319
RUNNING TOGETHER AS A 

2203
01:20:57,319 --> 01:20:57,919
PRESIDENTIAL TICKET. 

2204
01:20:57,919 --> 01:20:58,854
REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT.

FROM JOHN KERRY. 

2210
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,728
I HAD NEVER HEARD THAT STORY.  

2211
01:21:06,728 --> 01:21:09,531
I DIDN'T KNOW THEY TALKED ABOUT 

2212
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:10,131
IT.  

2213
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:18,506

AND EVERYONE WHO HAS LIFE AND 

2348
01:26:54,142 --> 01:26:57,578
HAS COMMITTED HIMSELF TO ME IN 

2349
01:26:57,578 --> 01:27:06,521
FAITH SHALL NOT DIE FOREVER.  

2350
01:27:06,521 --> 01:27:16,898
HAS FOR ME, -- AS FOR ME, I 

2351
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:18,099
KNOW THAT MY REDEEMER LIVES AND 

2352
01:27:18,099 --> 01:27:19,400
THAT AT THE LAST HE WILL STAND 

2353
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:25,373
UPON THE EARTH AND AFTER MY 

2354
01:27:25,373 --> 01:27:26,574
AWAKING HE WILL RAISE ME UP AND 

2355
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:31,546
IN MY BODY I SHALL SEE GOD.  

2356
01:27:31,546 --> 01:27:35,550
I MYSELF SHALL SEE AND BEHOLD 

2357
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:42,623
HIM WHO IS MY FRIEND AND NOT A 

2358
01:27:42,623 --> 01:27:43,391
STRANGER.  

2359
01:27:43,391 --> 01:27:47,595
FOR NONE OF US HAS LIFE IN 

2360
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:47,895
HIMSELF.  

2361
01:27:47,895 --> 01:27:48,996
AND NONE BECOMES HIS OWN MASTER 

2362
01:27:48,996 --> 01:27:52,800
WHEN HE DIES.  

2363
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,603
FOR IF WE HAVE LIFE, WE ARE 

2364
01:27:55,603 --> 01:28:00,475
ALIVE IN THE LORD, AND IF WE 

2365
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:09,150
DIE, WE DIE IN THE LORD.

2366
01:28:13,588 --> 01:28:16,791
SO THEN WHETHER WE LIVE OR DIE, 

2367
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:24,198
WE ARE THE LORD'S POSSESSION.  

2368
01:28:24,198 --> 01:28:25,600
HAPPY FROM NOW ON ARE THOSE WHO 

2369
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:28,403
DIE IN THE LORD.  

2370
01:28:28,403 --> 01:28:33,441
SO IT IS SAYS THE SPIRIT FOR 

2371
01:28:33,441 --> 01:28:41,049

AND WORTH FIGHTING FOR AND I 

2420
01:37:00,481 --> 01:37:04,451
HATE VERY MUCH TO LEAVE IT. 

2421
01:37:04,451 --> 01:37:11,659
WHEN ERNEST HEMINGWAY'S LIES 

2422
01:37:11,659 --> 01:37:12,626
WOUNDED WAITING FOR HIS LAST 

2423

FIGHT THESE ARE AMONG HIS FINAL 

2424
01:37:16,530 --> 01:37:16,864
THOUGHTS. 

2425
01:37:16,864 --> 01:37:18,065
MY FATHER HAD EVERY REASON TO 

2426
01:37:18,065 --> 01:37:19,366
THINK THE WORLD WAS AN AWFUL 

2427
01:37:19,366 --> 01:37:19,599
PLACE. 

2428
01:37:19,599 --> 01:37:20,768
MY FATHER HAD EVERY REASON TO 

2429
01:37:20,768 --> 01:37:23,037
THINK THE WORLD WAS NOT WORTH 

2430
01:37:23,037 --> 01:37:23,370
FIGHTING FOR. 

2431
01:37:23,370 --> 01:37:26,340
MY FATHER HAD EVERY REASON TO 

2432
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:29,243
THINK THE WORLD WAS WORTH 

2433
01:37:29,243 --> 01:37:29,510
LEAVING. 

2434
01:37:29,510 --> 01:37:31,612
HE DID NOT THINK ANY OF THOSE 

2435
01:37:31,612 --> 01:37:32,012
THINGS. 

2436
01:37:32,012 --> 01:37:34,014
LIKE THE HERO OF HIS FAVORITE 

2437
01:37:34,014 --> 01:37:37,418
BOOK, JOHN McCAIN TOOK THE 

2438
01:37:37,418 --> 01:37:37,818
OPPOSITE VIEW. 

2439
01:37:37,818 --> 01:37:39,486
YOU HAD TO HAVE A LOT OF FLOCK 

2440
01:37:39,486 --> 01:37:41,855
TO HAVE HAD SUCH A GOOD LIFE.  

2441
01:37:41,855 --> 01:37:43,057
I AM HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY 

2442
01:37:43,057 --> 01:37:47,361
SAYING THE WORDS: I HAVE NEVER 

2443
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:48,462
WANTED TO SAY, GIVING THE 

2444
01:37:48,462 --> 01:37:49,463
SPEECH I HAVE NEVER WANTED TO 

2445
01:37:49,463 --> 01:37:49,696
GIVE. 

2446
01:37:49,696 --> 01:37:51,265
FEELING THE LOSS I HAVE NEVER 

2447
01:37:51,265 --> 01:37:53,167
WANTED TO FEEL.  

2448
01:37:53,167 --> 01:38:02,710
MY FATHER IS GONE.

2449
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:03,811
JOHN SIDNEY McCAIN III WAS MANY 

2450
01:38:03,811 --> 01:38:04,244
THINGS. 

2451
01:38:04,244 --> 01:38:05,446
HE WAS A SAILOR, HE WAS AND 

2452
01:38:05,446 --> 01:38:07,014
AVIATOR,  HE WAS A HUSBAND, HE 

2453
01:38:07,014 --> 01:38:08,816
WAS A WARRIOR, HE WAS A 

2454
01:38:08,816 --> 01:38:09,116
PRISONER.  

2455
01:38:09,116 --> 01:38:12,853
HE WAS A HERO, HE WAS A 

2456
01:38:12,853 --> 01:38:17,958
CONGRESSMAN, HE WAS A SENATOR, 

2457
01:38:17,958 --> 01:38:18,859
HE WAS A NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT 

2458
01:38:18,859 --> 01:38:19,660
OF THE UNITED STATES. 

2459
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:23,063
THESE ARE ALL THE TITLES AND 

2460
01:38:23,063 --> 01:38:24,465
THE ROLES OF A LIFE THAT HAS 

2461
01:38:24,465 --> 01:38:25,065
BEEN WELL LIVED. 

2462
01:38:25,065 --> 01:38:26,367
THEY ARE NOT THE GREATEST OF 

2463
01:38:26,367 --> 01:38:26,667
HIS TITLES. 

2464
01:38:26,667 --> 01:38:27,868
NOR THE MOST IMPORTANT OF HIS 

2465
01:38:27,868 --> 01:38:28,101
ROLES. 

2466
01:38:28,101 --> 01:38:32,439
HE WAS A GREAT MAN. 

2467
01:38:32,439 --> 01:38:33,741
WE GATHER HERE TO MOURN THE 

2468
01:38:33,741 --> 01:38:34,641
PASSING OF AMERICAN GREATNESS.  

2469
01:38:34,641 --> 01:38:40,214
THE REAL THING.  

2470
01:38:40,214 --> 01:38:41,448
NOT CHEAP RHETORIC FROM MEN WHO 

2471
01:38:41,448 --> 01:38:42,449
WILL NEVER COME NEAR THE 

2472
01:38:42,449 --> 01:38:46,120
SACRIFICE HE GAVE SO WILLINGLY. 

2473
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:46,886
NOR THE OPPORTUNISTIC 

2474
01:38:46,886 --> 01:38:47,955
APPROPRIATION OF THOSE WHO LIVE 

2475
01:38:47,955 --> 01:38:49,056
LIVES OF COMFORT AND PRIVILEGE 

2476
01:38:49,056 --> 01:38:50,657
WILL HE SUFFERED AND SERVED. 

2477
01:38:50,657 --> 01:38:56,796
HE WAS A GREAT FIRE WHO BURNED 

2478
01:38:56,796 --> 01:39:02,169
BRIGHT.  

2479
01:39:02,169 --> 01:39:03,737
IN THE PAST FEW DAYS, MY FAMILY 

2480
01:39:03,737 --> 01:39:05,039
AND I HAVE HEARD FROM SO MANY 

2481
01:39:05,039 --> 01:39:06,040
OF THOSE AMERICANS WHO STOOD IN 

2482
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:07,241
THE WARMTH AND LIGHT OF HIS 

2483
01:39:07,241 --> 01:39:08,241
FIRE AND FOUND IT ILLUMINATED 

2484
01:39:08,241 --> 01:39:09,243
WHAT IS BEST ABOUT THEM. 

2485
01:39:09,243 --> 01:39:10,444
WE ARE GRATEFUL TO THEM BECAUSE 

2486
01:39:10,444 --> 01:39:15,215
THEY ARE GRATEFUL TO HIM. 

2487
01:39:15,215 --> 01:39:16,417
IF YOU HAVE RESENTED THAT FIRE, 

2488
01:39:16,417 --> 01:39:17,618
FOR THAT LIGHT IT CAST UPON 

2489
01:39:17,618 --> 01:39:18,619
THEM, FOR THE TRUTH IT REVEALED 

2490
01:39:18,619 --> 01:39:21,688
ABOUT THEIR CHARACTER, BUT MY 

2491
01:39:21,688 --> 01:39:24,058
FATHER NEVER CARED WHAT THEY 

2492
01:39:24,058 --> 01:39:25,259
THOUGHT AND EVEN THAT SMALL 

2493
01:39:25,259 --> 01:39:28,862
NUMBER STILL HAVE THE 

2494
01:39:28,862 --> 01:39:29,863
OPPORTUNITY AS LONG AS THEY 

2495
01:39:29,863 --> 01:39:31,265
DRAW BREATH TO LIVE UP THE TO 

2496
01:39:31,265 --> 01:39:32,266
THE EXAMPLE OF JOHN McCAIN. 

2497
01:39:32,266 --> 01:39:33,667
MY FATHER WAS A GREAT MAN. 

2498
01:39:33,667 --> 01:39:35,869
HE WAS A GREAT WARRIOR. 

2499
01:39:35,869 --> 01:39:43,110
HE WAS A GREAT AMERICAN.  I 

2500
01:39:43,110 --> 01:39:44,445
ADMIRED HIM FOR ALL OF THESE 

2501
01:39:44,445 --> 01:39:45,446
THINGS BUT I LOVE HIM BECAUSE 

2502
01:39:45,446 --> 01:39:50,250
HE WAS A GREAT FATHER.  

2503
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:51,518
MY FATHER KNEW WHAT IT WAS LIKE 

2504
01:39:51,518 --> 01:39:53,253
TO GROW UP IN THE SHADOW OF 

2505
01:39:53,253 --> 01:39:53,654
GREATNESS. 

2506
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:54,855
HE DID JUST AS HIS FATHER HAD 

2507
01:39:54,855 --> 01:39:57,858
DONE BEFORE HIM. 

2508
01:39:57,858 --> 01:39:59,059
HE WAS THE SON OF A GREAT 

2509
01:39:59,059 --> 01:40:00,461
ADMIRAL WHO WAS ALSO THE SON OF 

2510
01:40:00,461 --> 01:40:01,462
THE GREAT ART MERRILL -- 

2511
01:40:01,462 --> 01:40:08,669
ADMIRAL AND IT WHEN KING -- IT 

2512
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:11,839
BECAME TIME HE HAD NO CHOICE 

2513
01:40:11,839 --> 01:40:13,240
BUT TO WALK IN THE EXACT PATH. 

2514
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:14,608
HE HAD TO BECOME A SAILOR, GO 

2515
01:40:14,608 --> 01:40:16,210
TO WAR, HAD TO HAVE HIS SHOT AT 

2516
01:40:16,210 --> 01:40:17,044
BECOMING A GREAT ADMIRAL AS 

2517
01:40:17,044 --> 01:40:18,612
THEY ALSO HAD DONE. 

2518
01:40:18,612 --> 01:40:20,013
THE PATH OF HIS FATHER AND 

2519
01:40:20,013 --> 01:40:20,814
GRANDFATHER LET MY FATHER 

2520
01:40:20,814 --> 01:40:26,453
DIRECTLY TO THE HARROWING HELL 

2521
01:40:26,453 --> 01:40:27,354
OF THE HANOI HILTON. 

2522
01:40:27,354 --> 01:40:30,257
THIS IS A PUBLIC LEGEND THAT IS 

2523
01:40:30,257 --> 01:40:30,858
JOHN McCAIN. 

2524
01:40:30,858 --> 01:40:31,658
THIS IS WHERE ALL THE 

2525
01:40:31,658 --> 01:40:32,626
BIOGRAPHIES IN THE CAMPAIGN 

2526
01:40:32,626 --> 01:40:33,961
LITERATURE AND PUBLIC 

2527
01:40:33,961 --> 01:40:34,962
REMEMBRANCES SAY HE SHOWED HIS 

2528
01:40:34,962 --> 01:40:38,265
CHARACTER, HIS PATRIOTISM, HIS 

2529
01:40:38,265 --> 01:40:39,266
FAITH, AND HIS ENDURANCE IN THE 

2530
01:40:39,266 --> 01:40:41,668
WORST OF POSSIBLE 

2531
01:40:41,668 --> 01:40:42,035
CIRCUMSTANCES. 

2532
01:40:42,035 --> 01:40:43,070
THIS IS WHERE WE LEARNED WHO 

2533
01:40:43,070 --> 01:40:44,238
JOHN McCAIN TRULY WAS.  

2534
01:40:44,238 --> 01:40:46,240
AND ALL OF THAT IS VERY TRUE 

2535
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:49,076
EXCEPT FOR THE LAST PART.  

2536
01:40:49,076 --> 01:40:50,244
TODAY WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU 

2537
01:40:50,244 --> 01:40:52,813
WHERE I FOUND OUT WHO JOHN 

2538
01:40:52,813 --> 01:40:55,249
McCAIN TRULY WAS. 

2539
01:40:55,249 --> 01:41:01,455
IT WASN'T IN THE HANOI HILTON.  

2540
01:41:01,455 --> 01:41:02,756
IT WASN'T IN THE COCKPIT OF A 

2541
01:41:02,756 --> 01:41:03,657
FAST AND LEAVE THE FIGHTER 

2542
01:41:03,657 --> 01:41:03,957
JETS. 

2543
01:41:03,957 --> 01:41:05,292
IT WASN'T ON THE HIGH SEAS OR 

2544
01:41:05,292 --> 01:41:09,963
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. 

2545
01:41:09,963 --> 01:41:11,265
JOHN McCAIN WAS IN ALL OF THOSE 

2546
01:41:11,265 --> 01:41:12,766
PLACES BUT THE BEST OF HIM WAS 

2547
01:41:12,766 --> 01:41:13,133
SOMEWHERE ELSE. 

2548
01:41:13,133 --> 01:41:16,470
THE BEST OF JOHN McCAIN, THE 

2549
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:17,638
GREATEST OF HIS TITLES, AND THE 

2550
01:41:17,638 --> 01:41:18,939
MOST IMPORTANT OF HIS ROLES WAS 

2551
01:41:18,939 --> 01:41:19,506
AS A FATHER. 

2552
01:41:19,506 --> 01:41:21,842
IMAGINE THE WARRIOR THE NIGHT 

2553
01:41:21,842 --> 01:41:29,816
OF THE SKIES -- KNIGHT OF THE 

2554
01:41:29,816 --> 01:41:32,219
SKIES CARRYING HIS LITTLE GIRL 

2555
01:41:32,219 --> 01:41:38,358
TO BED, OVER IN THE SOUTH CHINA 

2556
01:41:38,358 --> 01:41:42,663
SEAS, KISSING THE HURT WHEN I 

2557
01:41:42,663 --> 01:41:44,064
FELL AND SKINNED MY KNEE AND 

2558
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:44,698
THE DISTINGUISHED STATESMAN WHO 

2559
01:41:44,698 --> 01:41:45,465
COUNSELED PRESIDENT IN THE 

2560
01:41:45,465 --> 01:41:46,266
POWERFUL SINGING WITH HIS 

2561
01:41:46,266 --> 01:41:48,602
LITTLE GIRL IN OAK CREEK DURING 

2562
01:41:48,602 --> 01:41:50,037
A RAINSTORM TO "SINGING IN THE 

2563
01:41:50,037 --> 01:41:52,573
RAIN."  

2564
01:41:52,573 --> 01:41:59,145
IMAGINE A SENATOR, FIERCE 

2565
01:41:59,145 --> 01:42:00,714
CONSCIENCE OF THE NATION'S BEST 

2566
01:42:00,714 --> 01:42:01,615
SELF TAKING HIS DAUGHTER OUT OF 

2567
01:42:01,615 --> 01:42:02,816
SCHOOL BECAUSE HE BELIEVED I 

2568
01:42:02,816 --> 01:42:03,617
WOULD LEARN MORE ABOUT AMERICA 

2569
01:42:03,617 --> 01:42:06,453
AT THE TOWN HALLS HE HELD 

2570
01:42:06,453 --> 01:42:07,054
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 

2571
01:42:07,054 --> 01:42:08,055
IMAGINE THE ELDERLY VETERAN OF 

2572
01:42:08,055 --> 01:42:09,556
WAR AND GOVERNMENT WHOSE WISDOM 

2573
01:42:09,556 --> 01:42:10,757
AND COURAGE WERE SOUGHT BY THE 

2574
01:42:10,757 --> 01:42:11,658
MOST DISTINGUISHED MEN OF OUR 

2575
01:42:11,658 --> 01:42:15,262
TIME WITH HIS EYES SHINING AS 

2576
01:42:15,262 --> 01:42:16,263
HAPPINESS AS HE GAVE HIS 

2577
01:42:16,263 --> 01:42:21,268
BLESSING FOR HIS GROWN 

2578
01:42:21,268 --> 01:42:21,735
DAUGHTER'S MARRIAGE. 

2579
01:42:21,735 --> 01:42:22,970
YOU ALL HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT.  

2580
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:24,438
I DON'T HAVE TO BECAUSE I LIVED 

2581
01:42:24,438 --> 01:42:24,838
IT ALL.  

2582
01:42:24,838 --> 01:42:26,140
I KNOW WHO HE WAS.  

2583
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:27,040
I KNOW WHAT DEFINED HIM. 

2584
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:29,443
I GOT TO SEE IT EVERY SINGLE 

2585
01:42:29,443 --> 01:42:33,447
DAY OF MY BLESSED LIFE.  

2586
01:42:33,447 --> 01:42:37,217
JOHN McCAIN WAS NOT DEFINED BY 

2587
01:42:37,217 --> 01:42:38,452
PRISON, BY THE NAVY, BY THE 

2588
01:42:38,452 --> 01:42:39,520
SENATE, BY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY 

2589
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:42,456
OR BY ANY SINGLE ONE OF THE 

2590
01:42:42,456 --> 01:42:43,056
DEEDS AND IS ABSOLUTELY 

2591
01:42:43,056 --> 01:42:44,258
EXTRAORDINARY LIFE. 

2592
01:42:44,258 --> 01:42:47,261
JOHN McCAIN WAS DEFINED BY 

2593
01:42:47,261 --> 01:42:47,661
LOVE.  

2594
01:42:47,661 --> 01:42:55,469
SEVERAL OF YOU OUT THERE PEWS 

2595
01:42:55,469 --> 01:42:56,470
CROSSED WORKED WITH HIM OR 

2596
01:42:56,470 --> 01:42:57,437
FOUND YOURSELF ON THE RECEIVING 

2597
01:42:57,437 --> 01:43:03,243
END OF HIS TEMPER OR YOU ARE 

2598
01:43:03,243 --> 01:43:04,477
DOING YOUR BEST TO STAY STONED 

2599
01:43:04,477 --> 01:43:04,811
FACE.  

2600
01:43:04,811 --> 01:43:05,112
DON'T. 

2601
01:43:05,112 --> 01:43:09,816
YOU KNOW IF JOHN McCAIN WERE IN 

2602
01:43:09,816 --> 01:43:11,018
YOUR SHOES HE WOULD BE USING 

2603
01:43:11,018 --> 01:43:12,219
SOME SALTY WORD HE LEARNED IN 

2604
01:43:12,219 --> 01:43:13,754
THE NAVY WHILE MY MOTHER JABBED 

2605
01:43:13,754 --> 01:43:17,057
HIM IN THE ARM AND 

2606
01:43:17,057 --> 01:43:17,424
EMBARRASSMENT. 

2607
01:43:17,424 --> 01:43:18,559
HE WOULD LOOK BACK AT HER AND 

2608
01:43:18,559 --> 01:43:19,860
MAYBE STOP TALKING BUT HE WOULD 

2609
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:20,227
KEEP GRINNING. 

2610
01:43:20,227 --> 01:43:21,461
SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD 

2611
01:43:21,461 --> 01:43:22,162
DO THAT.  

2612
01:43:22,162 --> 01:43:24,665
ON THEIR FIRST DATE, WHEN HE 

2613
01:43:24,665 --> 01:43:26,567
STILL DID NOT KNOW WHAT SORT OF 

2614
01:43:26,567 --> 01:43:32,439
WOMAN SHE WAS, HE RECITED A 

2615
01:43:32,439 --> 01:43:35,042
POEM CALLED: THE CREMATION OF 

2616
01:43:35,042 --> 01:43:36,109
SAM McGEE ABOUT AN ALASKAN 

2617
01:43:36,109 --> 01:43:36,876
PROSPECTOR WHO WELCOMED HIS 

2618
01:43:36,876 --> 01:43:38,145
CREMATION IS THE ONLY WAY TO 

2619
01:43:38,145 --> 01:43:45,018
GET WARM IN THE ICY AREA.  

2620
01:43:45,018 --> 01:43:46,219
THERE ARE STRANGE THINGS DONE 

2621
01:43:46,219 --> 01:43:47,454
IN THE MIDNIGHT SUN BY THE MEN 

2622
01:43:47,454 --> 01:43:48,522
WHO MOIL FOR GOLD.  

2623
01:43:48,522 --> 01:43:49,456
ARCTIC TRAILS OF SECRET TALES 

2624
01:43:49,456 --> 01:43:50,657
THAT WOULD MAKE YOUR BLOOD RUN 

2625
01:43:50,657 --> 01:43:51,058
COLD. 

2626
01:43:51,058 --> 01:43:57,297
HE LEARNED IT IN HANOI. 

2627
01:43:57,297 --> 01:43:58,665
A PRISONER IN THE NEXT CELL HAD 

2628
01:43:58,665 --> 01:44:00,667
WRITTEN IT OUT. 

2629
01:44:00,667 --> 01:44:06,440
IF SHE COULD APPRECIATE THE 

2630
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:09,443
DARK HUMOR THAT HAD SEEN HIM 

2631
01:44:09,443 --> 01:44:10,644
THROUGH SO MANY YEARS OF 

2632
01:44:10,644 --> 01:44:11,244
IMPRISONMENT, SHE JUST MIGHT 

2633
01:44:11,244 --> 01:44:12,446
SIT THROUGH A LIFETIME WITH 

2634
01:44:12,446 --> 01:44:13,447
HIM, AS WELL, AND SHE DID. 

2635
01:44:13,447 --> 01:44:14,614
JOHN McCAIN WAS DEFINED BY 

2636
01:44:14,614 --> 01:44:14,847
LOVE.  

2637
01:44:14,847 --> 01:44:16,616
THIS LOVE OF MY FATHER FROM MY 

2638
01:44:16,616 --> 01:44:18,819
MOTHER WAS THE MOST FIERCE AND 

2639
01:44:18,819 --> 01:44:22,856
LASTING OF THEM ALL, MOM.  

2640
01:44:22,856 --> 01:44:24,257
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT LOVE MEANT 

2641
01:44:24,257 --> 01:44:27,461
TO JOHN McCAIN. 

2642
01:44:27,461 --> 01:44:27,761
AND ME. 

2643
01:44:27,761 --> 01:44:33,066
HIS LOVE WAS A LOVE OF A 

2644
01:44:33,066 --> 01:44:33,299
FATHER. 

2645
01:44:33,299 --> 01:44:34,668
AS MUCH AS HE COMFORTS, HE WAS 

2646
01:44:34,668 --> 01:44:36,670
AND JUSTLY PRESENT FOR US AND 

2647
01:44:36,670 --> 01:44:37,838
WE DID NOT ALWAYS UNDERSTAND IT 

2648
01:44:37,838 --> 01:44:40,240
BUT HE WAS ALWAYS TEACHING.  

2649
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:42,442
HE DIDN'T EXPECT US TO BE LIKE 

2650
01:44:42,442 --> 01:44:42,642
HIM. 

2651
01:44:42,642 --> 01:44:51,418
HIS AMBITIONS FOR US WAS TO BE 

2652
01:44:51,418 --> 01:44:52,319
BETTER THAN HIM. 

2653
01:44:52,319 --> 01:44:53,019
ARMED WITH HIS WISDOM AND 

2654
01:44:53,019 --> 01:44:54,654
INFORMED BY HIS EXPERIENCES 

2655
01:44:54,654 --> 01:44:56,490
LONG BEFORE WE WERE EVEN OLD 

2656
01:44:56,490 --> 01:44:59,059
ENOUGH TO HAVEASSEMBLED OUR 

2657
01:44:59,059 --> 01:44:59,259
OWN. 

2658
01:44:59,259 --> 01:45:00,660
IS A GIRL, I DID NOT FULLY 

2659
01:45:00,660 --> 01:45:01,561
APPRECIATE WHAT I FULLY 

2660
01:45:01,561 --> 01:45:04,531
APPRECIATE NOW.  

2661
01:45:04,531 --> 01:45:06,767
HOW HE SUFFERED AND HOW HE WORE 

2662
01:45:06,767 --> 01:45:07,868
IT WITH HIS STOIC SILENCE THAT 

2663
01:45:07,868 --> 01:45:10,237
WAS ONCE THE MARK OF IN 

2664
01:45:10,237 --> 01:45:10,837
AMERICAN MAN.  

2665
01:45:10,837 --> 01:45:12,139
I CAME TO APPRECIATE IT FIRST 

2666
01:45:12,139 --> 01:45:13,240
WHEN HE DEMANDED IT OF ME. 

2667
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:16,476
I WAS A SMALL GIRL THROWN FROM 

2668
01:45:16,476 --> 01:45:18,245
A HORSE AND CRYING FROM A 

2669
01:45:18,245 --> 01:45:18,845
BUSTED COLLARBONE. 

2670
01:45:18,845 --> 01:45:22,916
MY DAD PICKED ME UP TOOK ME TO 

2671
01:45:22,916 --> 01:45:24,318
THE DOCTOR AND GOT ME ALL FIXED 

2672
01:45:24,318 --> 01:45:24,484
UP. 

2673
01:45:24,484 --> 01:45:25,819
HE IMMEDIATELY TOOK ME BACK 

2674
01:45:25,819 --> 01:45:27,354
HOME AND MADE ME GET BACK ON 

2675
01:45:27,354 --> 01:45:29,055
THAT VERY SAME HORSE. 

2676
01:45:29,055 --> 01:45:31,458
I WAS FURIOUS AT HIM AS A CHILD 

2677
01:45:31,458 --> 01:45:35,462
BT HOW I LOVE HIM FOR IT NOW.  

2678
01:45:35,462 --> 01:45:38,365
MY FATHER KNEW PAIN AND 

2679
01:45:38,365 --> 01:45:39,065
SUFFERING WITH ANKLE INTIMACY 

2680
01:45:39,065 --> 01:45:40,267
AND IMMEDIACY THAT MOST OF US 

2681
01:45:40,267 --> 01:45:45,605
ARE BLESSED NEVER TO HAVE 

2682
01:45:45,605 --> 01:45:45,872
ENDURED. 

2683
01:45:45,872 --> 01:45:46,606
HE WAS SHOT DOWN, CRIPPLED, 

2684
01:45:46,606 --> 01:45:47,808
BEATEN, STARVED, TORTURED, AND 

2685
01:45:47,808 --> 01:45:48,241
HUMILIATED.  

2686
01:45:48,241 --> 01:45:52,446
THAT PAIN NEVER LEFT HIM. 

2687
01:45:52,446 --> 01:45:53,413
THE CRUELTY OF HIS COMMUNIST 

2688
01:45:53,413 --> 01:45:54,614
CAPTORS IN SHORT HE WOULD NEVER 

2689
01:45:54,614 --> 01:45:55,916
RAISE HIS ARMS ABOVE HIS HEAD 

2690
01:45:55,916 --> 01:45:57,217
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.  

2691
01:45:57,217 --> 01:46:01,855
YET HE SURVIVED, YET HE 

2692
01:46:01,855 --> 01:46:03,957
ENDURED, YET HE TRIUMPHED. 

2693
01:46:03,957 --> 01:46:05,258
THERE WA THIS MAN WHO HAD BEEN 

2694
01:46:05,258 --> 01:46:09,463
THROUGH ALL OF THAT WITH A 

2695
01:46:09,463 --> 01:46:10,464
LITTLE GIRL WHO SIMPLY DIDN'T 

2696
01:46:10,464 --> 01:46:17,637
WANT TO GET BACK ON HER HORSE. 

2697
01:46:17,637 --> 01:46:18,939
HE COULD HAVE SAT ME DOWN AND 

2698
01:46:18,939 --> 01:46:20,440
TOLD ME ALL OF THAT AND MADE ME 

2699
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:21,441
FEEL SMALL BECAUSE MY COMPLAINT 

2700
01:46:21,441 --> 01:46:22,709
AND FEAR WAS NOTHING NEXT TO 

2701
01:46:22,709 --> 01:46:23,443
HIS PAIN AND MEMORY. 

2702
01:46:23,443 --> 01:46:24,610
INSTEAD HE MADE ME FEEL LOVED, 

2703
01:46:24,610 --> 01:46:30,550
HE SAID, MEGAN, AND IS QUITE'S 

2704
01:46:30,550 --> 01:46:32,419
VOICE -- WHITE VOICE THAT SPOKE 

2705
01:46:32,419 --> 01:46:33,653
WITH AUTHORITY, GET BACK ON THE 

2706
01:46:33,653 --> 01:46:38,458
HORSE. 

2707
01:46:38,458 --> 01:46:39,860
I DID AND BECAUSE I WAS A 

2708
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:40,961
LITTLE GIRL I RESENTED IT. 

2709
01:46:40,961 --> 01:46:42,462
NOW THAT I AM A WOMAN, I LOOKED 

2710
01:46:42,462 --> 01:46:43,663
BACK ACROSS THAT TIME AND SEE 

2711
01:46:43,663 --> 01:46:44,865
THE EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE WHEN 

2712
01:46:44,865 --> 01:46:46,066
I CLIMBED BACK UP AND RODE 

2713
01:46:46,066 --> 01:46:47,968
AGAIN AND I SEE THE PRIDE AS HE 

2714
01:46:47,968 --> 01:46:53,707
SAYS, NOTHING IS GOING TO BREAK 

2715
01:46:53,707 --> 01:47:02,048
YOU.  

2716
01:47:02,048 --> 01:47:03,250
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, 

2717
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:04,651
WHENEVER I FALL DOWN I GET BACK 

2718
01:47:04,651 --> 01:47:04,851
UP. 

2719
01:47:04,851 --> 01:47:06,453
WHENEVER I AM HURT I DRIVE ON 

2720
01:47:06,453 --> 01:47:07,888
AND WHEN I AM BROUGHT LOW, I 

2721
01:47:07,888 --> 01:47:09,289
RISE BUT THAT IS NOT BECAUSE I 

2722
01:47:09,289 --> 01:47:10,490
AM UNIQUELY VIRTUOUS OR STRONG 

2723
01:47:10,490 --> 01:47:11,258
OR RESILIENT.  

2724
01:47:11,258 --> 01:47:13,293
IT'S SIMPLY BECAUSE MY FATHER,  

2725
01:47:13,293 --> 01:47:17,097
JOHN McCAIN,  WAS. 

2726
01:47:17,097 --> 01:47:29,910
WHEN MY FATHER GOT SICK, WHEN I 

2727
01:47:29,910 --> 01:47:31,077
ASKED HIM WHAT HE WANTED ME TO 

2728
01:47:31,077 --> 01:47:32,279
DO WITH THIS EULOGY, HE SAID, 

2729
01:47:32,279 --> 01:47:33,880
SHOW THEM HOW TOUGH YOU ARE.  

2730
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:39,753
THAT IS WHAT LOVE MEANT TO JOHN 

2731
01:47:39,753 --> 01:47:40,187
McCAIN.  

2732
01:47:40,187 --> 01:47:41,421
LOVE FOR MY FATHER ALSO MEANT 

2733
01:47:41,421 --> 01:47:42,522
CARING FOR THE NATION ENTRUSTED 

2734
01:47:42,522 --> 01:47:44,524
TO HIM. 

2735
01:47:44,524 --> 01:47:45,892
MY FATHER, THE TRUE SON OF HIS 

2736
01:47:45,892 --> 01:47:46,893
FATHER AND GRANDFATHER WAS BORN 

2737
01:47:46,893 --> 01:47:48,728
INTO AN ENDURING SENSE OF THE 

2738
01:47:48,728 --> 01:47:49,495
CHARACTER OF AMERICAN GREATNESS 

2739
01:47:49,495 --> 01:47:50,730
AND WAS CONVINCED OF THE NEED 

2740
01:47:50,730 --> 01:47:56,936
TO DEFEND IT WITH FEROCITY AND 

2741
01:47:56,936 --> 01:47:57,270
FAITH.

2742
01:47:57,270 --> 01:47:58,471
JOHN McCAIN WAS BORN IN A 

2743
01:47:58,471 --> 01:47:59,272
DISTANT AND NOW VANQUISHED 

2744
01:47:59,272 --> 01:48:01,041
OUTPOST OF AMERICAN POWER  AND 

2745
01:48:01,041 --> 01:48:04,077
HE UNDERSTOOD AMERICA AS A 

2746
01:48:04,077 --> 01:48:09,382
SACRED TRUST AND UNDERSTOOD OUR 

2747
01:48:09,382 --> 01:48:10,015
PUBLIC DEMANDS RESPONSIBILITIES 

2748
01:48:10,015 --> 01:48:10,850
EVEN BEFORE IT DEFENDS ITS 

2749
01:48:10,850 --> 01:48:11,083
RIGHTS. 

2750
01:48:11,083 --> 01:48:16,890
HE KNEW NAVIGATING THE LINE 

2751
01:48:16,890 --> 01:48:18,291
BETWEEN GOOD AND EAGLE -- EVIL 

2752
01:48:18,291 --> 01:48:19,125
WAS OFTEN DIFFICULT BUT ALWAYS 

2753
01:48:19,125 --> 01:48:19,893
SIMPLE. 

2754
01:48:19,893 --> 01:48:21,528
HE GRASPED THAT OUR PURPOSE AND 

2755
01:48:21,528 --> 01:48:22,095
MEANING WAS ROOTED IN A 

2756
01:48:22,095 --> 01:48:22,695
MISSIONARY'S RESPONSIBILITY 

2757
01:48:22,695 --> 01:48:29,402
STRETCHING BACK CENTURIES.  

2758
01:48:29,402 --> 01:48:30,470
JUST AS THE FIRST AMERICANS 

2759
01:48:30,470 --> 01:48:31,671
LOOKED UPON A NEW WORLD FULL OF 

2760
01:48:31,671 --> 01:48:33,073
POTENTIAL FOR A GRAND 

2761
01:48:33,073 --> 01:48:33,973
EXPERIMENT IN FREEDOM AND SELF-

2762
01:48:33,973 --> 01:48:38,878
GOVERNMENT, SO DO THEIR 

2763
01:48:38,878 --> 01:48:39,345
DESCENDENTS HAVE THE 

2764
01:48:39,345 --> 01:48:40,080
RESPONSIBILITY TO DEFEND THE 

2765
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:41,481
OLD WORLD FROM IT'S WORTH SELF. 

2766
01:48:41,481 --> 01:48:43,049
THE AMERICA OF JOHN McCAIN  IS 

2767
01:48:43,049 --> 01:48:44,084
THE AMERICA OF REVOLUTION. 

2768
01:48:44,084 --> 01:48:47,887
FIGHTERS WITH NO STOMACH FOR 

2769
01:48:47,887 --> 01:48:48,888
THE SUNSHINE PATRIOT MAKING THE 

2770
01:48:48,888 --> 01:48:50,190
WORLD A NEW WITH THE BELLS OF 

2771
01:48:50,190 --> 01:48:50,456
LIBERTY. 

2772
01:48:50,456 --> 01:48:51,491
THE AMERICA OF JOHN McCAIN IS 

2773
01:48:51,491 --> 01:48:55,528
THE AMERICA  OF ABRAHAM 

2774
01:48:55,528 --> 01:48:55,795
LINCOLN.  

2775
01:48:55,795 --> 01:48:56,730
FULFILLING THE PROMISE OF THE 

2776
01:48:56,730 --> 01:48:57,330
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE 

2777
01:48:57,330 --> 01:49:02,302
THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL 

2778
01:49:02,302 --> 01:49:03,503
AND SUFFERING GREATLY TO SEE IT 

2779
01:49:03,503 --> 01:49:03,770
THROUGH. 

2780
01:49:03,770 --> 01:49:04,671
THE AMERICA OF JOHN McCAIN IS 

2781
01:49:04,671 --> 01:49:06,072
THE AMERICA OF THE BOYS WHO 

2782
01:49:06,072 --> 01:49:07,273
RUSHED  THE COLORS IN EVERY WAR 

2783
01:49:07,273 --> 01:49:09,576
ACROSS THREE CENTURIES KNOWING 

2784
01:49:09,576 --> 01:49:11,077
THAT IN THEM IS THE LIFE OF THE 

2785
01:49:11,077 --> 01:49:11,478
REPUBLIC.  

2786
01:49:11,478 --> 01:49:16,950
PARTICULARLY THOSE BY THEIR 

2787
01:49:16,950 --> 01:49:18,685
DARING AS RONALD REAGAN SAID, 

2788
01:49:18,685 --> 01:49:19,686
GAVE UP THEIR CHANCE AT BEING 

2789
01:49:19,686 --> 01:49:20,520
HUSBANDS AND FATHERS AND 

2790
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:25,625
GRANDFATHRS AND TO BE REVERED 

2791
01:49:25,625 --> 01:49:26,226
OLD MEN. 

2792
01:49:26,226 --> 01:49:27,293
THE AMERICA OF JOHN McCAIN IS, 

2793
01:49:27,293 --> 01:49:28,628
YES, THE AMERICA OF VIETNAM , 

2794

MOST FOR LONG CAUSE IN GRIM 

2796
01:49:37,671 --> 01:49:38,672
CIRCUMSTANCES AND EVEN IN THE 

2797
01:49:38,672 --> 01:49:39,973
MOST DISTANT AND HOSTILE CORNER 

2798
01:49:39,973 --> 01:49:40,674
OF THE WORLD.  

2799
01:49:40,674 --> 01:49:42,175
STANDING IN DEFEAT FOR THE LIFE 

2800
01:49:42,175 --> 01:49:42,876
AND LIBERTIES OF OTHER PEOPLES 

2801
01:49:42,876 --> 01:49:44,477
IN OTHER LANDS. 

2802
01:49:44,477 --> 01:49:45,679
THE AMERICA OF JOHN McCAIN IS 

2803
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:48,381
GENEROUS AND WELCOMING AND 

2804
01:49:48,381 --> 01:49:48,682
BOLD.  

2805
01:49:48,682 --> 01:49:50,283
SHE IS RESOURCEFUL AND 

2806

CONFIDENT AND SECURE. 

2807
01:49:50,750 --> 01:49:56,222
SHE MEETS HER RESPONSIBILITIES. 

2808
01:49:56,222 --> 01:49:57,290
SHE SPEAKS QUIETLY BECAUSE SHE 

2809
01:49:57,290 --> 01:49:59,492
IS STRONG. 

2810
01:49:59,492 --> 01:50:00,560
AMERICA DOES NOT VOTE BECAUSE 

2811
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:01,494
SHE HAS NO NEED TO. 

2812
01:50:01,494 --> 01:50:04,197
THE AMERICA OF JOHN McCAIN  HAS 

2813
01:50:04,197 --> 01:50:05,699
NO NEED TO BE MADE GREAT AGAIN 

2814
01:50:05,699 --> 01:50:06,499
BECAUSE AMERICA WAS ALWAYS 

2815
01:50:06,499 --> 01:50:07,100
GREAT.  

2816
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:11,871
>> [APPLAUSE] 

2817
01:50:11,871 --> 01:50:28,888
>> THAT FERVENT FAITH, PROVEN 

2818
01:50:28,888 --> 01:50:36,329
DEVOTION, ABIDING LOVE IS WHAT 

2819
01:50:36,329 --> 01:50:37,530
DROVE MY FATHER FROM THE FIERY 

2820
01:50:37,530 --> 01:50:38,798
SKIES ABOVE THE RED RIVER DELTA 

2821
01:50:38,798 --> 01:50:40,100
TO THE BRINK OF THE PRESIDENCY 

2822
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:40,333
ITSELF. 

2823
01:50:40,333 --> 01:50:43,870
LOVE TO FIND MY FATHER.  

2824
01:50:43,870 --> 01:50:45,271
AS A YOUNG MAN HE WONDERED IF 

2825
01:50:45,271 --> 01:50:46,272
HE WOULD MEASURE UP TO HIS 

2826
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:46,772
DISTINGUISHED LINEAGE. 

2827
01:50:46,772 --> 01:50:47,640
I MISS HIM SO BADLY. 

2828
01:50:47,640 --> 01:50:51,678
úI WANT TO 

2829
01:50:51,678 --> 01:50:53,079
BUT I TAKE SMALL COMFORT IN 

2830
01:50:53,079 --> 01:50:53,279
THIS. 

2831
01:50:53,279 --> 01:50:54,080
SOMEWHERE IN THE GREAT BEYOND 

2832
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:58,685
WHERE THE WARRIORS GO, THERE 

2833
01:50:58,685 --> 01:50:59,886

WHAT LOVE MUST BE. 

2844
01:51:22,409 --> 01:51:25,477
AN ANCIENT GREEK HISTORIAN 

2845
01:51:25,477 --> 01:51:26,913
WROTE THE IMAGE OF GREAT MEN IS 

2846
01:51:26,913 --> 01:51:28,915
WOVEN INTO THE STUFF OF OTHER 

2847

MEN'S LIVES. 

2848
01:51:29,382 --> 01:51:37,323
TO HAVE YOUR GREATNESS WOVEN

01:51:37,323 --> 01:51:38,725
INTO MY LIFE, IT IS WOVEN INTO 

2850

SISTER'S LIFE AND WOVEN INTO MY 

2852

EVEN WITH LINDSEY GRAHAM ALONG, 

3039
02:03:05,544 --> 02:03:06,645
THE PURPOSE WAS NOT TO HAVE

02:03:48,587 --> 02:03:49,588
PEACE WHEREVER THEY WERE AND 

3060
02:03:49,588 --> 02:03:50,789
THEY, IN TURN, WELCOMED HIM IN 

3061
02:03:50,789 --> 02:03:59,198
NOT JUST RESPECT BUT AWE AS THE 

3062
02:03:59,198 --> 02:04:00,599
HERO JOHN McCAIN WAS, IS, AND 

3063
02:04:00,599 --> 02:04:07,640
ALWAYS WILL BE. 

3064
02:04:07,640 --> 02:04:08,541
IN SHARED EXPERIENCES AND LONG 

3065
02:04:08,541 --> 02:04:09,375
CONVERSATIONS, ON THESE TRIPS, 

3066
02:04:09,375 --> 02:04:11,043
WE GOT TO KNOW AND TRUST EACH 

3067
02:04:11,043 --> 02:04:12,344
OTHER AS FRIENDS IN A WAY THAT 

3068
02:04:12,344 --> 02:04:14,547
DOESN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE IT CAN'T 

3069
02:04:14,547 --> 02:04:17,950
HAPPEN MUCH ANYMORE IN THE 

3070
02:04:17,950 --> 02:04:21,987
FRENETIC WASHINGTON LIFE OF 

3071
02:04:21,987 --> 02:04:22,287
SENATORS.  

3072
02:04:22,287 --> 02:04:24,189
OUR FRIENDSHIP TAUGHT ME MANY 

3073
02:04:24,189 --> 02:04:27,393
THINGS INCLUDING I MUST ADD, 

3074
02:04:27,393 --> 02:04:28,393
SOME JOKES THAT I OTHERWISE 

3075
02:04:28,393 --> 02:04:31,096
NEVER WOULD HAVE KNOWN. 

3076
02:04:31,096 --> 02:04:32,865
>> [LAUGHTER] 

3077
02:04:32,865 --> 02:04:37,169
>> JOHN LOVED TO LAUGH AND MAKE 

3078
02:04:37,169 --> 02:04:37,770
OTHERS LAUGH.  

3079
02:04:37,770 --> 02:04:39,138
WHEN HE FOUND A JOKE THAT 

3080
02:04:39,138 --> 02:04:40,639
PEOPLE LIKED, HE TOLD IT OVER 

3081
02:04:40,639 --> 02:04:44,743
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  

3082
02:04:44,743 --> 02:04:46,145
ONE OF MY FAVORITES WAS ABOUT 

3083
02:04:46,145 --> 02:04:48,347
THE TWO INMATES GOING THROUGH 

3084
02:04:48,347 --> 02:04:54,386
THE FOOD LINE FOR DINNER AT THE 

3085
02:04:54,386 --> 02:04:54,987
STATE PENITENTIARY.  

3086
02:04:54,987 --> 02:04:56,388
ONE SAYS TO THE OTHER, THE FOOD 

3087
02:04:56,388 --> 02:04:57,189
IS TERRIBLE HERE.  

3088
02:04:57,189 --> 02:04:59,792
THE OTHER SAYS, IT WAS A LOT 

3089
02:04:59,792 --> 02:05:02,962
BETTER WHEN I WAS GOVERNOR.  

3090
02:05:02,962 --> 02:05:07,099
>> [LAUGHTER] 

3091
02:05:07,099 --> 02:05:12,438
>> [LAUGHTER] 

3092
02:05:12,438 --> 02:05:12,704
>> YEAH. 

3093
02:05:12,704 --> 02:05:14,139
I HEARD THAT ONE OFTEN AND I 

3094
02:05:14,139 --> 02:05:16,542
LAUGHED EVERY TIME BECAUSE JOHN 

3095
02:05:16,542 --> 02:05:22,348
LAUGHED SO HARD EVERY TIME HE 

3096
02:05:22,348 --> 02:05:22,948
TOLD IT. 

3097
02:05:22,948 --> 02:05:23,749
THE RANGE OF HIS MIND, 

3098
02:05:23,749 --> 02:05:25,351
INTEREST, AND EXPERIENCE WAS 

3099
02:05:25,351 --> 02:05:32,391
IMPRESSIVE AND OFTEN SURPRISING.

3100
02:05:32,391 --> 02:05:33,192
YOU COULDN'T CHARACTERIZE THIS 

3101
02:05:33,192 --> 02:05:33,492
MAN. 

3102
02:05:33,492 --> 02:05:34,393
HE LOVED TO READ HISTORY, 

3103
02:05:34,393 --> 02:05:35,594
FICTION, AND TO TALK ABOUT IT, 

3104
02:05:35,594 --> 02:05:36,161
ARGUE ABOUT IT. 

3105
02:05:36,161 --> 02:05:37,196
HE HAD A PERVASIVE CURIOSITY 

3106
02:05:37,196 --> 02:05:39,765
ABOUT EVERYTHING IN LIFE.  

3107
02:05:39,765 --> 02:05:47,139
HE LOVED THE OUTDOORS AND ALL 

3108
02:05:47,139 --> 02:05:48,240
OF GOD'S CREATURES, LARGE AND 

3109
02:05:48,240 --> 02:05:48,941
SMALL WHO LIVED THERE. 

3110
02:05:48,941 --> 02:05:50,042
MOST PEOPLE WOULD BE SURPRISED 

3111
02:05:50,042 --> 02:05:53,045
BY HOW MUCH PLEASURE THIS 

3112
02:05:53,045 --> 02:05:53,746
COMBATIVE SENATOR GOT FROM 

3113
02:05:53,746 --> 02:05:54,947
WATCHING THE HUMMINGBIRDS AT 

3114
02:05:54,947 --> 02:06:02,087
THE McCAIN FAMILY HOME OUTSIDE 

3115
02:06:02,087 --> 02:06:02,487
SEDONA, ARIZONA. 

3116
02:06:02,487 --> 02:06:03,589
HIS GREAT STRENGTH, OF COURSE, 

3117
02:06:03,589 --> 02:06:06,292
WAS HIS CHARACTER. 

3118
02:06:06,292 --> 02:06:10,362
HE WAS HONEST, FAIR, AND A 

3119
02:06:10,362 --> 02:06:10,763
CIVILIZED.  

3120
02:06:10,763 --> 02:06:14,867
IN ALL THE TIMES WE WERE 

3121
02:06:14,867 --> 02:06:15,968
TOGETHER, I NEVER HEARD HIM SAY 

3122
02:06:15,968 --> 02:06:18,337
A BIGOTED WORD ABOUT ANYONE. 

3123
02:06:18,337 --> 02:06:21,340
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAW THIS 

3124
02:06:21,340 --> 02:06:23,942
GREAT QUALITY MOST CLEARLY 

3125
02:06:23,942 --> 02:06:25,544
DURING THE 2000 CAMPAIGN WHEN 

3126
02:06:25,544 --> 02:06:31,950
THAT WOMAN MADE AN OFFENSIVE 

3127
02:06:31,950 --> 02:06:33,152
STATEMENT AGAINST THEN SENATOR 

3128
02:06:33,152 --> 02:06:33,952
BARACK OBAMA.  

3129
02:06:33,952 --> 02:06:35,087
TO ME WHAT WAS MOST IMPRESSIVE 

3130
02:06:35,087 --> 02:06:35,988
ABOUT JOHN'S REACTION WAS THAT 

3131
02:06:35,988 --> 02:06:37,189
IT WAS PURE REFLEX. 

3132
02:06:37,189 --> 02:06:40,592
IT WAS WHO JOHN WAS. 

3133
02:06:40,592 --> 02:06:41,660
HE DIDN'T NEED TO CONSULT 

3134
02:06:41,660 --> 02:06:43,195
ANYONE AND IMMEDIATELY DEFENDED 

3135
02:06:43,195 --> 02:06:47,266
HIS OPPONENT'S NAME AND HONOR 

3136
02:06:47,266 --> 02:06:48,600
AND THEREBY ELEVATED FOR THAT 

3137
02:06:48,600 --> 02:06:50,169
MOMENT, OUR POLITICS AND MADE 

3138
02:06:50,169 --> 02:06:53,939
US A MORE PERFECT UNION.  

3139
02:06:53,939 --> 02:06:55,040
PERSONALLY I COULD TELL YOU 

3140
02:06:55,040 --> 02:06:56,742
THAT JOHN WAS A REAL FRIEND AND 

3141
02:06:56,742 --> 02:07:02,548
ACCOMMODATING WHAT TO HIM -- 

3142
02:07:02,548 --> 02:07:03,949
WHAT TO HIM WHERE MY UNUSUAL 

3143
02:07:03,949 --> 02:07:07,352
PRACTICES AS A RELIGIOUSLY 

3144
02:07:07,352 --> 02:07:08,387
OBSERVANT JEW WHETHER WORKING 

3145
02:07:08,387 --> 02:07:09,655
WITH ME ON A SATURDAY TO AN 

3146
02:07:09,655 --> 02:07:12,624
IMPORTANT MEETING OR TURNING 

3147
02:07:12,624 --> 02:07:17,162
DOWN A POPULAR FRIDAY NIGHT 

3148
02:07:17,162 --> 02:07:17,963
DINNER INVITATION AT THE MUNICH 

3149
02:07:17,963 --> 02:07:18,964
SECURITY CONFERENCE WE WENT TO 

3150
02:07:18,964 --> 02:07:20,165
EVERY YEAR BECAUSE IT WAS TOO 

3151
02:07:20,165 --> 02:07:21,767
FAR TO WALK, WE WOULD STAY IN 

3152
02:07:21,767 --> 02:07:22,868
THE HOTEL AND HAVE WHAT JOHN 

3153
02:07:22,868 --> 02:07:26,538
LEARNED TO CALL OUR SO LOAN 

3154
02:07:26,538 --> 02:07:26,805
DINNERS. 

3155
02:07:26,805 --> 02:07:32,044
PEACEFUL SABBATH DINNERS. 

3156
02:07:32,044 --> 02:07:34,947
JOHN NATURALLY IN DOING THESE 

3157
02:07:34,947 --> 02:07:35,581
WONDERFUL ACTS OF FRIENDSHIP 

3158
02:07:35,581 --> 02:07:41,053
<font color="#00FFFF"><u>RUMBLED ALL THE WAY ABOUT WHAT </u></font>

3159
02:07:41,053 --> 02:07:41,987
I WAS PUTTING HIM THROUGH. 

3160
02:07:41,987 --> 02:07:43,489
RIGHT NOW I THINK HE'S PROBABLY 

3161
02:07:43,489 --> 02:07:44,757
DERIVING SOME PLEASURE FROM THE 

3162
02:07:44,757 --> 02:07:46,091
FACT IT TURNED OUT HIS FUNERAL 

3163
02:07:46,091 --> 02:07:49,061
WAS HELD ON A SATURDAY AND I 

3164
02:07:49,061 --> 02:07:50,596
HAD TO WALK TO GET HERE. 

3165
02:07:50,596 --> 02:07:50,929
>> [LAUGHTER] 

3166
02:07:50,929 --> 02:07:55,968
>> I'M SURE HE WOULD TELL ME 

3167
02:07:55,968 --> 02:08:02,941
THAT WAS DIVINE JUSTICE.  

3168
02:08:02,941 --> 02:08:04,143
HE ULTIMATELY, AS HE DID WITH 

3169
02:08:04,143 --> 02:08:07,079
SO MUCH OF HIS LIFE, TURNED 

3170
02:08:07,079 --> 02:08:09,948
THESE INTERFAITH EXPERIENCES 

3171
02:08:09,948 --> 02:08:14,586
INTO A TRULY HILARIOUS COMEDY 

3172
02:08:14,586 --> 02:08:14,853
ROUTINE. 

3173
02:08:14,853 --> 02:08:15,988
IT BEGAN WITH A SOLEMN 

3174
02:08:15,988 --> 02:08:19,191
PRONOUNCEMENT BY JOHN THAT HE 

3175
02:08:19,191 --> 02:08:24,630
WAS CONVERTING TO JUDAISM. 

3176
02:08:24,630 --> 02:08:27,766
THEN HE EXPLAINED MUCH LESS 

3177
02:08:27,766 --> 02:08:28,967
SOLEMNLY, I DO THIS NOT BECAUSE 

3178
02:08:28,967 --> 02:08:29,968
OF ANY PARTICULAR LIKING FOR 

3179
02:08:29,968 --> 02:08:30,769
THE RELIGION.  

3180
02:08:30,769 --> 02:08:33,138
IT'S JUST THAT FOR SO MANY 

3181
02:08:33,138 --> 02:08:34,840
YEARS I'VE HAD TO GO ALONG WITH 

3182
02:08:34,840 --> 02:08:38,143
ALL OF JOE'S RELIGIOUS NONSENSE 

3183
02:08:38,143 --> 02:08:39,545
THAT I MIGHT AS WELL CONVERT 

3184
02:08:39,545 --> 02:08:40,446
AND GET THE BENEFITS. 

3185
02:08:40,446 --> 02:08:40,779
>> [LAUGHTER] 

3186
02:08:40,779 --> 02:08:42,047
>> ONE OF HIS FAVORITE TARGETS 

3187
02:08:42,047 --> 02:08:45,951
WAS THE SABBATH ELEVATORS IN 

3188
02:08:45,951 --> 02:08:46,952
ISRAELI HOTELS WHICH ARE 

3189
02:08:46,952 --> 02:08:48,987
PREPROGRAMMED TO STOP AT EVERY 

3190
02:08:48,987 --> 02:08:49,220
FLOOR. 

3191
02:08:49,220 --> 02:08:50,389
JOHN HAD MANY VIRTUES BUT 

3192
02:08:50,389 --> 02:08:56,761
PATIENTS WAS NOT ONE OF THEM -- 

3193
02:08:56,761 --> 02:09:03,368
PATIENCE WAS NOT ONE OF THEM. 

3194
02:09:03,368 --> 02:09:04,603
THEREFORE THOSE RIDES ON THE 

3195
02:09:04,603 --> 02:09:05,336
ELEVATORS WERE NOT THE HAPPIEST 

3196
02:09:05,336 --> 02:09:06,438
TIMES SPENT TOGETHER.  

3197
02:09:06,438 --> 02:09:09,541
I SAY THIS BOTH TO SAY IN 

3198
02:09:09,541 --> 02:09:14,847
STORIES, HOW FULL AND GENUINE 

3199
02:09:14,847 --> 02:09:15,647
WAS HIS ACCEPTANCE OF MY 

3200
02:09:15,647 --> 02:09:20,486
RELIGIOUS PRACTICES, WHICH WERE 

3201
02:09:20,486 --> 02:09:21,386
DIFFERENT FROM WHAT HE KNEW, 

3202
02:09:21,386 --> 02:09:22,588
BUT ALSO TO MAKE A LARGER 

3203
02:09:22,588 --> 02:09:23,889
POINTS BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU, 

3204
02:09:23,889 --> 02:09:25,958
EVERYTHING WE DID TOGETHER IN 

3205
02:09:25,958 --> 02:09:27,392
THE WORLD, WASHINGTON, AND 

3206
02:09:27,392 --> 02:09:31,363
ACROSS AMERICA, HE SHOWED THE 

3207
02:09:31,363 --> 02:09:37,769
SAME ACCEPTANCE, RESPECT, 

3208
02:09:37,769 --> 02:09:38,737
CURIOSITY ABOUT EVERYBODY'S 

3209
02:09:38,737 --> 02:09:39,538
RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES AND ABOUT 

3210
02:09:39,538 --> 02:09:41,139
EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT THEM THAT 

3211
02:09:41,139 --> 02:09:45,043
WAS DIFFERENT FROM HIMSELF AND 

3212
02:09:45,043 --> 02:09:47,346
HIS OWN EXPERIENCES.  

3213
02:09:47,346 --> 02:09:57,589
I'VE SAID THAT PATIENCE WAS ONE 

3214
02:09:57,589 --> 02:09:58,190
VIRTUE JOHN DIDN'T HAVE. 

3215
02:09:58,190 --> 02:09:59,291
FORGIVENESS WAS A GREAT VIRTUE 

3216
02:09:59,291 --> 02:10:00,592
HE DID HAVE AND HERE'S A STORY. 

3217
02:10:00,592 --> 02:10:05,964
ON A TRIP TO HANOI AS WE WERE 

3218
02:10:05,964 --> 02:10:06,965
TOURING THE HANOI HILTON, A 

3219
02:10:06,965 --> 02:10:07,599
CROWD OF VIETNAMESE COLLEGE 

3220
02:10:07,599 --> 02:10:08,367
STUDENTS RECOGNIZED JOHN AND 

3221
02:10:08,367 --> 02:10:19,544
THEY BEGAN TO CHANT WILDLY. 

3222
02:10:19,544 --> 02:10:20,145
McCAIN, McCAIN.  

3223
02:10:20,145 --> 02:10:21,346
THEY WANTED TO TAKE HIS PICTURE 

3224
02:10:21,346 --> 02:10:25,050
AND SIGN AUTOGRAPHS.  

3225
02:10:25,050 --> 02:10:26,551
I ASKED HIM WHY HE GOT SUCH A 

3226
02:10:26,551 --> 02:10:31,490
ROCK STAR RECEPTION IN HANOI 

3227
02:10:31,490 --> 02:10:32,691
AND WITH CLASSIC DIRECTNESS HE 

3228
02:10:32,691 --> 02:10:33,592
SAID, FIRST OF ALL IT'S BECAUSE 

3229
02:10:33,592 --> 02:10:35,961
THEY'VE BEEN TAUGHT THAT I WAS 

3230
02:10:35,961 --> 02:10:37,229
TREATED A LOT BETTER HERE THAN 

3231
02:10:37,229 --> 02:10:42,868
I REALLY WAS.  

3232
02:10:42,868 --> 02:10:43,836
AND THE SECOND IT'S BECAUSE OF 

3233
02:10:43,836 --> 02:10:44,603
THE NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS 

3234
02:10:44,603 --> 02:10:47,139
BETWEEN THE U.S. AND VIETNAM.  

3235
02:10:47,139 --> 02:10:48,740
THAT WAS A CLASSIC McCAIN 

3236
02:10:48,740 --> 02:10:49,107
UNDERSTATEMENT. 

3237
02:10:49,107 --> 02:10:52,044
ALONG WITH PRESIDENT CLINTON 

3238
02:10:52,044 --> 02:10:53,145
AND JOHN KERRY, JOHN McCAIN WAS 

3239
02:10:53,145 --> 02:10:57,950
THE LEADER IN CONGRESS IN 

3240
02:10:57,950 --> 02:10:58,550
BRINGING ABOUT THE 

3241
02:10:58,550 --> 02:10:59,251
NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS 

3242
02:10:59,251 --> 02:11:01,353
BETWEEN THE USA AND VIETNAM.  

3243
02:11:01,353 --> 02:11:04,389
AN EXTRAORDINARY ACT OF 

3244
02:11:04,389 --> 02:11:05,090
PERSONAL FORGIVENESS.  

3245
02:11:05,090 --> 02:11:05,891
WHEN YOU CONSIDER WHAT THE 

3246
02:11:05,891 --> 02:11:08,593
VIETNAMESE DID TO HIM, DURING 

3247
02:11:08,593 --> 02:11:09,995
HIS 5 1/2 YEARS AS A PRISONER 

3248
02:11:09,995 --> 02:11:10,495
OF WAR. 

3249
02:11:10,495 --> 02:11:13,165
AFTER HIS INJURIES IN VIETNAM, 

3250
02:11:13,165 --> 02:11:16,168
HE COULD NOT PURSUE HIS 

3251
02:11:16,168 --> 02:11:19,738
AMBITIONS IN THE NAVY. 

3252
02:11:19,738 --> 02:11:20,739
HE TURNED TO GOVERNMENT SERVICE 

3253
02:11:20,739 --> 02:11:25,744
AS IS GREATER AMERICAN CAUSE. 

3254
02:11:25,744 --> 02:11:27,145
OF COURSE, I DIDN'T KNOW JOHN 

3255
02:11:27,145 --> 02:11:29,348
IN HIS YOUTH BUT I DON'T THINK 

3256
02:11:29,348 --> 02:11:30,549
HE WAS BORN WITH THE NATURAL 

3257
02:11:30,549 --> 02:11:34,987
SKILLS OF A LEGISLATURE AND YET 

3258
02:11:34,987 --> 02:11:36,088
HE LEARNED THEM AND BECAME A 

3259
02:11:36,088 --> 02:11:36,421
GREAT ONE. 

3260
02:11:36,421 --> 02:11:38,957
HE KNEW WHEN TO BE IRASCIBLE 

3261
02:11:38,957 --> 02:11:41,860
AND IMMOVABLE AND WHEN TO 

3262
02:11:41,860 --> 02:11:43,762
NEGOTIATE AND COMPROMISE TO GET 

3263
02:11:43,762 --> 02:11:45,964
SOMETHING DONE.  

3264
02:11:45,964 --> 02:11:46,865
HE REGULARLY REACHED ACROSS 

3265
02:11:46,865 --> 02:11:50,168
PARTY LINES BECAUSE HE KNEW 

3266
02:11:50,168 --> 02:11:51,737
THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO SOLVE 

3267
02:11:51,737 --> 02:11:54,740
PROBLEMS AND SEIZE 

3268
02:11:54,740 --> 02:11:56,341
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PEOPLE OF 

3269
02:11:56,341 --> 02:11:59,544
OUR COUNTRY AND HIS STATE. 

3270
02:11:59,544 --> 02:12:01,146
AS A RESULT, HIS LEGISLATIVE 

3271
02:12:01,146 --> 02:12:05,951
RECORD IS EXTREMELY IMPRESSIVE. 

3272
02:12:05,951 --> 02:12:10,756
HE ALSO FOUGHT AND LOST SOME 

3273
02:12:10,756 --> 02:12:11,390
BIG BATTLES.  

3274
02:12:11,390 --> 02:12:12,591
TO STOP CLIMATE CHANGE, CLOSE 

3275
02:12:12,591 --> 02:12:14,259
THE GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE, BROADLY 

3276
02:12:14,259 --> 02:12:17,763
REFORM OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS.  

3277
02:12:17,763 --> 02:12:19,164
THAT NEVER SEEMED TO GET HIM 

3278
02:12:19,164 --> 02:12:24,369
DOWN OR DIMINISH HIS ARDOR FOR 

3279
02:12:24,369 --> 02:12:24,970
THE NEXT BATTLE.  

3280
02:12:24,970 --> 02:12:29,341
HE LOVED TO WIN ALSO LOVED A 

3281
02:12:29,341 --> 02:12:30,742
GOOD FIGHT FOR A JUST CAUSE 

3282
02:12:30,742 --> 02:12:35,347
EVEN IF IT DIDN'T SUCCEED.  

3283
02:12:35,347 --> 02:12:36,348
OVERALL, HE WANTED MANY MORE 

3284
02:12:36,348 --> 02:12:37,949
THAN HE LOST AND ALL OF HIS BIG 

3285
02:12:37,949 --> 02:12:38,750
WINS WERE ACHIEVED WITH 

3286
02:12:38,750 --> 02:12:40,552
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. 

3287
02:12:40,552 --> 02:12:42,387
IN 2000 AIDS WHEN JOHN WAS THE 

3288
02:12:42,387 --> 02:12:45,590
REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR 

3289
02:12:45,590 --> 02:12:48,393
PRESIDENT, HE HAD THIS FAR OUT 

3290
02:12:48,393 --> 02:12:49,761
IDEA OF ASKING A DEMOCRAT TO BE 

3291
02:12:49,761 --> 02:12:50,796
HIS RUNNING MATE. 

3292
02:12:50,796 --> 02:12:52,397
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? 

3293
02:12:52,397 --> 02:12:57,569
LET ME EXPLAIN IT.  

3294
02:12:57,569 --> 02:12:59,037
WHEN HE FIRST TALKED TO ME 

3295
02:12:59,037 --> 02:12:59,938
ABOUT IT, I SAID, I'M REALLY 

3296
02:12:59,938 --> 02:13:01,339
HONORED BUT I DON'T SEE HOW YOU 

3297
02:13:01,339 --> 02:13:04,142
CAN DO IT.  

3298
02:13:04,142 --> 02:13:05,243
EVEN THOUGH I WON MY LAST 

3299
02:13:05,243 --> 02:13:06,945
ELECTION AS AN INDEPENDENT, I'M 

3300
02:13:06,945 --> 02:13:08,546
STILL A REGISTERED DEMOCRAT. 

3301
02:13:08,546 --> 02:13:15,987
HIS RESPONSE WAS DIRECT AND, 

3302
02:13:15,987 --> 02:13:20,592
REALLY, ENNOBLING. THAT'S THE 

3303
02:13:20,592 --> 02:13:21,760
POINT, JOE, HE SAID WITH A 

3304
02:13:21,760 --> 02:13:22,193
CERTAIN IMPATIENCE. 

3305
02:13:22,193 --> 02:13:22,961
YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT. 

3306
02:13:22,961 --> 02:13:24,796
I'M A REPUBLICAN. 

3307
02:13:24,796 --> 02:13:25,964
WE COULD GIVE OUR COUNTRY THE 

3308
02:13:25,964 --> 02:13:26,865
BIPARTISAN LEADERSHIP IT NEEDS 

3309
02:13:26,865 --> 02:13:30,769
IT FOR A CHANGE.  

3310
02:13:30,769 --> 02:13:31,569
WHEN JOHN RETURNED TO THE 

3311
02:13:31,569 --> 02:13:35,340
SENATE AFTER HIS SURGERY LAST 

3312
02:13:35,340 --> 02:13:36,641
SUMMER AND VOTED AGAINST THE 

3313
02:13:36,641 --> 02:13:37,241
REPUBLICAN HEALTH CARE BILL, 

3314
02:13:37,241 --> 02:13:38,143
SOME PEOPLE ACCUSED HIM OF 

3315
02:13:38,143 --> 02:13:39,744
BEING DISLOYAL TO HIS PARTY AND 

3316
02:13:39,744 --> 02:13:40,144
THE PRESIDENT. 

3317
02:13:40,144 --> 02:13:42,347
BUT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE.  

3318
02:13:42,347 --> 02:13:47,352
IF YOU LISTEN TO THE SPEECH HE 

3319
02:13:47,352 --> 02:13:48,887
GAVE THAT DAY YOU WILL KNOW IT 

3320
02:13:48,887 --> 02:13:49,988
WAS NOT THE CASE AND THAT 

3321
02:13:49,988 --> 02:13:51,289
SPEECH MADE CLEAR HIS VOTE WAS 

3322
02:13:51,289 --> 02:13:52,190
NOT REALLY AGAINST THAT BILL 

3323
02:13:52,190 --> 02:13:57,395
BUT AGAINST THE MINDLESS 

3324
02:13:57,395 --> 02:13:58,263
PARTISANSHIP THAT HAS TAKEN 

3325
02:13:58,263 --> 02:14:00,165
CONTROL OF BOTH OF OUR 

3326
02:14:00,165 --> 02:14:01,133
POLITICAL PARTIES AND OUR 

3327
02:14:01,133 --> 02:14:03,568
GOVERNMENT AND PRODUCED TOTALLY 

3328
02:14:03,568 --> 02:14:06,138
ONE-SIDED RESPONSES TO 

3329
02:14:06,138 --> 02:14:09,641
COMPLICATED NATIONAL PROBLEMS 

3330
02:14:09,641 --> 02:14:10,041
LIKE HEALTHCARE.  

3331
02:14:10,041 --> 02:14:11,543
AND OF COURSE HE WAS RIGHT.  

3332
02:14:11,543 --> 02:14:16,548
HIS REMARKS LAST JULY ALSO 

3333
02:14:16,548 --> 02:14:17,549
SPOKE ELOQUENTLY OF OUR 

3334
02:14:17,549 --> 02:14:23,388
POSITION IN THE WORLD OF 

3335
02:14:23,388 --> 02:14:23,855
AMERICA'S CONTINUING 

3336
02:14:23,855 --> 02:14:24,455
RESPONSIBILITY FOR PRINCIPAL 

3337
02:14:24,455 --> 02:14:25,390
LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD AND IT 

3338
02:14:25,390 --> 02:14:26,758
WAS AS IF HE THOUGHT THAT MIGHT 

3339
02:14:26,758 --> 02:14:28,593
BE ONE OF HIS LAST BEST 

3340
02:14:28,593 --> 02:14:29,160
OPPORTUNITIES TO MOVE HIS 

3341
02:14:29,160 --> 02:14:36,368
COLLEAGUES AND HIS COUNTRY.  

3342
02:14:36,368 --> 02:14:37,569
IT'S A SPEECH WORTH READING BUT 

3343
02:14:37,569 --> 02:14:38,737
I JUST WANT TO QUOTE ONE 

3344
02:14:38,737 --> 02:14:39,137
SENTENCE.  

3345
02:14:39,137 --> 02:14:40,338
WHAT GREATER CAUSE COULD WE 

3346
02:14:40,338 --> 02:14:42,941
HOPE TO SERVE THAN HELPING KEEP 

3347
02:14:42,941 --> 02:14:44,943
AMERICA STRONG, INSPIRING 

3348
02:14:44,943 --> 02:14:50,348
BEACON OF LIBERTY AND DIGNITY 

3349
02:14:50,348 --> 02:14:51,550
AND DEFENDER OF THE DIGNITY OF 

3350
02:14:51,550 --> 02:14:54,986
ALL HUMAN BEINGS.  

3351
02:14:54,986 --> 02:14:57,588
THAT, IN SHORT, WAS THE McCAIN 

3352
02:14:57,588 --> 02:15:01,193
AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY.  

3353
02:15:01,193 --> 02:15:07,566
MORAL, ENGAGED, AND A STRONG.  

3354
02:15:07,566 --> 02:15:11,636
THESE WORDS WERE NOT JUST 

3355
02:15:11,636 --> 02:15:12,103
RHETORIC FOR JOHN. 

3356
02:15:12,103 --> 02:15:13,438
HE ACTED ON THEM, LIVED TO THEM 

3357
02:15:13,438 --> 02:15:14,739
AND IN OUR TRAVELS AROUND THE 

3358
02:15:14,739 --> 02:15:19,144
WORLD, HE ALWAYS REASSURED OUR 

3359
02:15:19,144 --> 02:15:19,945
ALLIES AND UNSETTLED OUR 

3360
02:15:19,945 --> 02:15:20,212
ENEMIES. 

3361
02:15:20,212 --> 02:15:21,746
STANDING FOR AMERICA'S BEST 

3362
02:15:21,746 --> 02:15:22,047
VALUES. 

3363
02:15:22,047 --> 02:15:22,547
ATTACKING TOTALITARIAN 

3364
02:15:22,547 --> 02:15:25,450
GOVERNMENTS WEATHER IN MOSCOW, 

3365
02:15:25,450 --> 02:15:28,586
TEHRAN, PYONGYANG OR ANYWHERE 

3366
02:15:28,586 --> 02:15:28,987
ELSE. 

3367
02:15:28,987 --> 02:15:30,288
IF WE WERE GOING TO A COUNTRY 

3368
02:15:30,288 --> 02:15:32,390
THAT WAS NOT FULLY FREE, JOHN 

3369
02:15:32,390 --> 02:15:33,859
INSISTED THAT WE MEET WITH THE 

3370
02:15:33,859 --> 02:15:35,961
LOCAL HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS AS 

3371
02:15:35,961 --> 02:15:38,964
WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT.  

3372
02:15:38,964 --> 02:15:43,235
I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT DAY 

3373
02:15:43,235 --> 02:15:46,538
DURING THE MILITARY 

3374
02:15:46,538 --> 02:15:49,941
DICTATORSHIP WE MET THREE MEN 

3375
02:15:49,941 --> 02:15:54,646
WHO HAD JUST BEEN RELEASED FROM 

3376
02:15:54,646 --> 02:15:55,347
POLITICAL PRISON AND SHOWED 

3377
02:15:55,347 --> 02:15:56,948
TERRIBLE SIGNS OF PHYSICAL AND 

3378
02:15:56,948 --> 02:16:00,452
PSYCHOLOGICAL ABUSE. 

3379
02:16:00,452 --> 02:16:03,288
THEY TOLD US THAT THEY WOULD 

3380
02:16:03,288 --> 02:16:04,623
NEVER HAVE SURVIVED IF THEY HAD 

3381
02:16:04,623 --> 02:16:10,262
NOT HEARD IN JAIL THAT THE 

3382
02:16:10,262 --> 02:16:11,196
GREAT AMERICAN SENATOR JOHN 

3383
02:16:11,196 --> 02:16:14,966
McCAIN HAS SUPPORTED THEIR 

3384
02:16:14,966 --> 02:16:16,268
CAUSE, READ THEIR NAMES ON THE 

3385
02:16:16,268 --> 02:16:19,037
U.S. SENATE FLOOR AND DEMANDED 

3386
02:16:19,037 --> 02:16:19,771
THEIR RELEASE.  

3387
02:16:19,771 --> 02:16:23,141
ON ANOTHER OCCASION, WE VISITED 

3388
02:16:23,141 --> 02:16:25,343
A REFUGEE CAMP FOR SYRIANS WHO 

3389
02:16:25,343 --> 02:16:26,544
HAD BEEN FORCED AT OF THEIR 

3390
02:16:26,544 --> 02:16:29,347
COUNTRY INTO TURKEY BY THE 

3391
02:16:29,347 --> 02:16:31,082
BRUTAL AGGRESSION OF THE 

3392
02:16:31,082 --> 02:16:35,387
IRANIANS AND RUSSIANS.  

3393
02:16:35,387 --> 02:16:36,588
WE WERE THE FIRST MEMBERS OF 

3394
02:16:36,588 --> 02:16:37,755
CONGRESS TO VISIT THAT CAMP AND 

3395
02:16:37,755 --> 02:16:38,757
THERE WAS SOME CONCERN ABOUT 

3396
02:16:38,757 --> 02:16:43,495
THE RECEPTION WE WOULD RECEIVE. 

3397
02:16:43,495 --> 02:16:45,397
EARLIER IN THE DAY, IN FACT, AN 

3398
02:16:45,397 --> 02:16:48,767
OFFICIAL OF THE U.N. HAD BEEN 

3399
02:16:48,767 --> 02:16:50,067
THERE AND HAS SHOES THROWN AT 

3400
02:16:50,067 --> 02:16:50,268
THEM. 

3401
02:16:50,268 --> 02:16:51,369
WHEN WE ARRIVED, A LARGE CROWD 

3402
02:16:51,369 --> 02:16:56,941
OF SYRIAN REFUGEES WAS 

3403
02:16:56,941 --> 02:16:58,977
CHANTING. 

3404
02:16:58,977 --> 02:17:03,147
BUT RATHER THAN BOOING AND 

3405
02:17:03,147 --> 02:17:04,349
THROWING SHOES, THEY WERE 

3406
02:17:04,349 --> 02:17:06,751
CHEERING AND CHEERING AND 

3407
02:17:06,751 --> 02:17:09,888
CHANTING WORDS OF WELCOME AND 

3408
02:17:09,888 --> 02:17:12,991
THANKS AND THE TWO WORDS THEY 

3409
02:17:12,991 --> 02:17:18,663
CHANTED MOST WERE, JOHN McCAIN. 

3410
02:17:18,663 --> 02:17:20,965
WHAT IS MOST REMARKABLE ABOUT 

3411
02:17:20,965 --> 02:17:28,440
THESE TWO STORIES IS HOW 

3412
02:17:28,440 --> 02:17:33,611
UNREMARKABLE HOW THEY ARE 

3413
02:17:33,611 --> 02:17:39,751
BECAUSE THE NAME JOHN McCAIN 

3414
02:17:39,751 --> 02:17:41,152
BASED ON THE ACTIONS OF THE MAN 

3415
02:17:41,152 --> 02:17:42,654
JOHN McCAIN HAD BECOME A SOURCE 

3416
02:17:42,654 --> 02:17:43,788
OF HOPE AND INSPIRATION  FOR 

3417
02:17:43,788 --> 02:17:47,759
OPPRESSED PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE 

3418
02:17:47,759 --> 02:17:48,192
WORLD.  

3419
02:17:48,192 --> 02:17:49,593
AS IT WAS A SOURCE OF SECURITY 

3420
02:17:49,593 --> 02:17:55,367
FOR ALLIED COUNTRIES THAT SHARE 

3421
02:17:55,367 --> 02:17:56,968
OUR VALUES. 

3422
02:17:56,968 --> 02:17:58,169
ONE OF HIS FAVORITE CITIES IN 

3423
02:17:58,169 --> 02:17:59,337
THE WORLD WAS JERUSALEM. 

3424
02:17:59,337 --> 02:18:03,842
ONE OF HIS FAVORITE THINGS TO 

3425
02:18:03,842 --> 02:18:05,243
DO WAS TO STAND ON THE BALCONY 

3426
02:18:05,243 --> 02:18:06,343
WITH LINDSEY GRAHAM AND ME 

3427
02:18:06,343 --> 02:18:12,549
LOOKING OUT AT THE OLD CITY AND 

3428
02:18:12,549 --> 02:18:13,450
DISCUSSING ALL OF THE RELIGIOUS 

3429
02:18:13,450 --> 02:18:19,224
AND POLITICAL HISTORY THAT HAD 

3430
02:18:19,224 --> 02:18:19,491
HAPPENED. 

3431
02:18:19,491 --> 02:18:20,959
WHEN I FIRST TOLD JOHN THAT I 

3432
02:18:20,959 --> 02:18:22,360
HAD DECIDED NOT TO RUN FOR THE 

3433
02:18:22,360 --> 02:18:24,529
SENATE AGAIN IN 2012, HE WAS 

3434
02:18:24,529 --> 02:18:28,466
PUZZLED AND, FRANKLY, EVEN A 

3435
02:18:28,466 --> 02:18:29,166
LITTLE BIT ANGRY.  

3436
02:18:29,166 --> 02:18:34,939
THE NEXT DAY HE CALLED ME.  

3437
02:18:34,939 --> 02:18:36,141
THIS IS MY BEST RECOLLECTION OF 

3438
02:18:36,141 --> 02:18:36,574
THE CONVERSATION. 

3439
02:18:36,574 --> 02:18:38,343
I'VE BEEN THINKING, IF YOU GO 

3440
02:18:38,343 --> 02:18:40,545
OUT INTO THE PRIVATE SECTOR, 

3441
02:18:40,545 --> 02:18:42,347
YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE SOME MORE 

3442
02:18:42,347 --> 02:18:52,590
MONEY AND THEN YOU AND HADASSAH 

3443
02:18:52,590 --> 02:18:53,858
CAN AFFORD TO BUY A SECOND HOME 

3444
02:18:53,858 --> 02:18:55,160
IN JERUSALEM THAT HAS ANNEXED A 

3445
02:18:55,160 --> 02:18:55,760
HOME FOR ME. 

3446
02:18:55,760 --> 02:18:56,160
WITH A BALCONY. 

3447
02:18:56,160 --> 02:18:59,564
WE COULD LOOK OUT AND TALK 

3448
02:18:59,564 --> 02:19:02,967
ABOUT THAT CITY AND ITS 

3449
02:19:02,967 --> 02:19:03,234
HISTORY.  

3450
02:19:03,234 --> 02:19:05,036
SINCE THEN, WHEN I TALKED TO 

3451
02:19:05,036 --> 02:19:11,543
JOHN VISITED WITH HIM, HE WOULD 

3452
02:19:11,543 --> 02:19:13,044
ASK ME, JOEY, HAVE YOU MADE 

3453
02:19:13,044 --> 02:19:14,145
ENOUGH MONEY YET TO BUY THAT 

3454
02:19:14,145 --> 02:19:17,348
PLACE IN JERUSALEM? 

3455
02:19:17,348 --> 02:19:17,647
[LAUGHTER] 

3456
02:19:17,647 --> 02:19:20,151
I WOULD ANSWER NOT YET BUT I'M 

3457
02:19:20,151 --> 02:19:20,585
GETTING CLOSER.

3458
02:20:04,496 --> 02:20:08,600
. 

3459
02:20:08,600 --> 02:20:14,472
>>> AND IT IS TO THAT HEAVENLY 

3460
02:20:14,472 --> 02:20:15,273
WHERE I AM CONFIDENT THE SOUL 

3461
02:20:15,273 --> 02:20:16,640
OF JOHN SIDNEY McCAIN III IS 

3462
02:20:16,640 --> 02:20:18,776
GOING NOW.  

3463
02:20:18,776 --> 02:20:19,878
AND I WANT TO IMAGINE THAT 

3464
02:20:19,878 --> 02:20:21,446
THERE'S GOING TO BE A BEAUTIFUL 

3465
02:20:21,446 --> 02:20:25,016
HOME WAITING FOR HIM THERE.    

3466
02:20:25,016 --> 02:20:27,051
WITH A BALCONY  FROM WHICH HE 

3467
02:20:27,051 --> 02:20:30,989
CAN CONTEMPLATE  THE SHINING 

3468
02:20:30,989 --> 02:20:33,191
CITY.     

3469
02:20:33,191 --> 02:20:36,628
HOPEFULLY INSPIRE US HERE ON 

3470
02:20:36,628 --> 02:20:39,864
EARTH TO CONDUCT OURSELVES WITH 

3471
02:20:39,864 --> 02:20:43,268
JUST SOME OF THE PATRIOT TIM, 

3472
02:20:43,268 --> 02:20:44,635

CHARACTERIZE HIS MAGNIFICENT 

3474
02:20:46,604 --> 02:20:49,808
LIFE OF SERVICE TO AMERICA AND 

3475
02:20:49,808 --> 02:20:55,113
TO SO MANY  NOBLE CAUSES 

3476
02:20:55,113 --> 02:20:57,481
GREATER THAN HIMSELF. 

3477
02:20:57,481 --> 02:21:02,553
GODSPEED DEAR FELONY,MAY ANGELS 

3478
02:21:02,553 --> 02:21:04,689
SING YOU TO YOUR ETEETERNAL 

3479
02:21:04,689 --> 02:21:08,259
HOME.      

3480
02:22:40,585 --> 02:22:41,219
. 

3481
02:22:41,219 --> 02:22:43,587
>>> OUR COUNTRY HAS HAD THE 

3482
02:22:43,587 --> 02:22:49,527
GOOD FORTUNE THAT AT TIMES OF 

3483
02:22:49,527 --> 02:22:51,562
NATIONAL TRIAL A FEW GREAT 

3484
02:22:51,562 --> 02:22:52,196
PERSONALITIES HAVE EMERGED TO 

3485
02:22:52,196 --> 02:22:59,704
REMIND US  OF OUR ESSENTIAL 

3486
02:22:59,704 --> 02:23:01,573
UNITY AND INSPIRED US TO FULFILL

3487
02:23:01,573 --> 02:23:07,111
OUR SUSTAINING VALUES.     

3488
02:23:07,111 --> 02:23:09,613
JOHN McCAIN WAS ONE OF THOSE 

3489
02:23:09,613 --> 02:23:17,789
GIFTS  OF DESTINY.      

3490
02:23:17,789 --> 02:23:22,427
I MET JOHN  FOR THE FIRST TIME  

3491
02:23:22,427 --> 02:23:27,398
IN APRIL 1973.      

3492
02:23:27,398 --> 02:23:30,435
AT A WHITE HOUSE RECEPTION FOR 

3493
02:23:30,435 --> 02:23:32,303
PRISONERS  RETURNED FROM 

3494
02:23:32,303 --> 02:23:35,640
CAPTIVITY  IN VIETNAM.     

3495
02:23:35,640 --> 02:23:39,343
HE HAD BEEN MUCH ON MY MIND  

3496
02:23:39,343 --> 02:23:42,480
DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS TO END 

3497
02:23:42,480 --> 02:23:50,555
SLEET HE TELL UNANIMOUS WAR.    

3498
02:23:50,555 --> 02:23:52,457
PROUDLY ALSO BECAUSE HIS FATHER 

3499
02:23:52,457 --> 02:23:55,860
THEN COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE 

3500
02:23:55,860 --> 02:24:01,031
PACIFIC COMMAND  WHEN BRIEFING 

3501
02:24:01,031 --> 02:24:04,835
THE PRESIDENT  AND REFERENCES 

3502
02:24:04,835 --> 02:24:07,105
TO HIS SON BY SAYING ONLY  I 

3503
02:24:07,105 --> 02:24:13,144
PRAY FOR HIM.      

3504
02:24:13,144 --> 02:24:14,545
IN THE McCAIN FAMILY NATIONAL 

3505
02:24:14,545 --> 02:24:20,551
SERVICE  WAS ITS OWN REWARD.    

3506
02:24:20,551 --> 02:24:22,653
THEY DID NOT ALLOW  FOR SPECIAL 

3507
02:24:22,653 --> 02:24:26,891
TREATMENT.     

3508
02:24:26,891 --> 02:24:32,095
I THOUGHT OF THAT  WHEN HIS 

3509
02:24:32,095 --> 02:24:35,699
VIETNAMESE CAN'T TWICE DURING 

3510
02:24:35,699 --> 02:24:39,303
THE PHASE OF NEGOTIATIONS 

3511
02:24:39,303 --> 02:24:42,140
OFFERED TO RELIEVE JOHN SO THAT 

3512
02:24:42,140 --> 02:24:46,310
HE COULD RETURN WITH ME ON THE 

3513
02:24:46,310 --> 02:24:50,248
OFFICIAL PLANE THAT HAD BROUGHT 

3514
02:24:50,248 --> 02:24:52,349
ME TO HANOI AGAINST ALL MY 

3515
02:24:52,349 --> 02:24:53,785
INSTINCT, I THANKED HIM FOR THE 

3516
02:24:53,785 --> 02:24:57,054
OFFER, BUT REFUSED IT.      

3517
02:24:57,054 --> 02:25:00,224
I WONDERED WHAT JOHN WOULD SAY  

3518
02:25:00,224 --> 02:25:15,740
WHEN WE FINALLY  MET.    

3519
02:25:15,740 --> 02:25:20,745
THANK YOU FOR SAVING MY HONOR.  

3520
02:25:20,745 --> 02:25:25,582
HE DID NOT TELL ME THEN  OR 

3521
02:25:25,582 --> 02:25:28,586
EVER THAT HE HAD HAD AN 

3522
02:25:28,586 --> 02:25:31,222
OPPORTUNITY TO BE FREED  YEARS 

3523
02:25:31,222 --> 02:25:34,959
EARLIER. 

3524
02:25:34,959 --> 02:25:35,560
BUT HAD REFUSED.    

3525
02:25:35,560 --> 02:25:43,167
A DECISION FOR WHICH HE HAD TO 

3526
02:25:43,167 --> 02:25:43,767
ENDURE ADDITIONAL PERIODS OF 

3527
02:25:43,767 --> 02:25:48,639
ISOLATION  AND HARDSHIP.    

3528
02:25:48,639 --> 02:25:52,243
NOR DID HE EVER  SPEAK OF HIS 

3529
02:25:52,243 --> 02:25:55,046
CAPTIVITY AGAIN.     

3530
02:25:55,046 --> 02:25:59,784
DURING THE NEAR HALF CENTURY  

3531
02:25:59,784 --> 02:26:08,326
OF CLOSE FRIENDSHIP.      

3532
02:26:08,326 --> 02:26:13,164
JOHN'S FOCUS WAS ON CREATING A 

3533
02:26:13,164 --> 02:26:14,899
BETTER FUTURE AS A SENATOR HE 

3534
02:26:14,899 --> 02:26:19,103
SUPPORTED THE RESTORATION OF 

3535
02:26:19,103 --> 02:26:24,475
RELATIONS WITH VIETNAM, HELPED 

3536
02:26:24,475 --> 02:26:26,444
BRING IT ABOUT ON A BIPARTISAN 

3537
02:26:26,444 --> 02:26:27,912
PHASES IN THE CLINTON 

3538
02:26:27,912 --> 02:26:36,521
ADMINISTRATION AND BECAME ONE 

3539
02:26:36,521 --> 02:26:37,588
OF THE ADVOCATES OF 

3540
02:26:37,588 --> 02:26:39,523
RECONCILIATION WITH HIS -- 

3541
02:26:39,523 --> 02:26:46,731
ENEMY.     

3542
02:26:46,731 --> 02:26:52,470
HONOR WAS JOHN'S --. 

3543
02:26:52,470 --> 02:26:53,404
IT IS AN INTANGIBLEQUALITY, IT 

3544
02:26:53,404 --> 02:26:58,609
IS NOT  OBLIGATORY. 

3545
02:26:58,609 --> 02:27:05,683
IT HAS NO WRITTEN CODE. 

3546
02:27:05,683 --> 02:27:07,718
IT REFLECTS AN INWARD 

3547
02:27:07,718 --> 02:27:08,786
COMPULSION FREE OF SELF 

3548
02:27:08,786 --> 02:27:11,522
INTERESTS.     

3549
02:27:11,522 --> 02:27:17,595
IT FULFILLS  A CAUSE  NOT A 

3550
02:27:17,595 --> 02:27:21,599
PERSONAL AMBITION.     

3551
02:27:21,599 --> 02:27:25,602
IT REPRESENTS  WHAT A SOCIETY 

3552
02:27:25,602 --> 02:27:28,972
LIVES FOR  BEYOND THE 

3553
02:27:28,972 --> 02:27:33,511
NECESSITIES OF THE MOMENT.     

3554
02:27:33,511 --> 02:27:43,321
LAW MAKES LIFE POSSIBLE.      

3555
02:27:43,321 --> 02:27:44,754
HONOR AND NOBLETY. 

3556
02:27:44,754 --> 02:27:50,127
FORJOHN IT WAS A WAY OF LIFE.   

3557
02:27:50,127 --> 02:27:54,165
JOHN RETURNED TO AN AMERICA 

3558
02:27:54,165 --> 02:27:57,968
DIVIDED OVER ITS PRESIDENCY, 

3559
02:27:57,968 --> 02:28:02,940
DIVIDED OVER THE WAR, AMIDST 

3560
02:28:02,940 --> 02:28:07,144
ALL THE TURMOIL DIVIDED OVER 

3561
02:28:07,144 --> 02:28:10,915
THE BEST WAY TO PROTECT OUR 

3562
02:28:10,915 --> 02:28:16,620
COUNTRY  AND KNOW WHETHER IT 

3563
02:28:16,620 --> 02:28:18,222
SHOULD BE RESPECTED FOR ITS 

3564
02:28:18,222 --> 02:28:19,590
POWER OR ITS IDEALS.     

3565
02:28:19,590 --> 02:28:24,795
JOHN CAME BACK FROM THE WAR  

3566
02:28:24,795 --> 02:28:28,665
AND DECLARED THAT THIS IS A 

3567
02:28:28,665 --> 02:28:29,600
FALSE CHOICE. 

3568
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:34,438
AMERICA OWED IT TOITSELF  TO 

3569
02:28:34,438 --> 02:28:37,241
EMBRACE  BOTH STRENGTHS AND 

3570
02:28:37,241 --> 02:28:43,814
IDEALS.     

3571
02:28:43,814 --> 02:28:45,616
IN DECADES OF CONGRESSIONAL 

3572
02:28:45,616 --> 02:28:49,520
SERVICE ULTIMATELY AS CHAIRMAN 

3573
02:28:49,520 --> 02:28:53,624
OF THE SENATE ARMS SERVICES 

3574
02:28:53,624 --> 02:28:55,126
COMMITTEE JOHN WAS AN EXPONENT 

3575
02:28:55,126 --> 02:29:00,197
OF AN AMERICA  STRONG ENOUGH  

3576
02:29:00,197 --> 02:29:06,170
TO VINDICATE  ITS PURPOSE.      

3577
02:29:06,170 --> 02:29:10,508
BUT JOHN BELIEVED ALSO  IN A 

3578
02:29:10,508 --> 02:29:14,945
COMPASSIONATE AMERICA  GOVERNED 

3579
02:29:14,945 --> 02:29:17,047
-- GUIDED BY CORE PRINCIPLES 

3580
02:29:17,047 --> 02:29:18,215
FOR WHICH AMERICAN FOREIGN 

3581
02:29:18,215 --> 02:29:24,522
POLICY  MUST ALWAYS STAND.     

3582
02:29:24,522 --> 02:29:28,626
WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR 

3583
02:29:28,626 --> 02:29:30,961
ALL IS NOT AN EMPTY SENTIMENT 

3584
02:29:30,961 --> 02:29:34,165
HE ARGUED.    

3585
02:29:34,165 --> 02:29:39,937
IT IS -- OF OUR NATIONAL 

3586
02:29:39,937 --> 02:29:40,237
CONSCIOUS. 

3587
02:29:40,237 --> 02:29:52,216
TO JOHN AMERICAN -- HAD 

3588
02:29:52,216 --> 02:29:52,749
UNIVERSAL APPLICABILITY. 

3589
02:29:52,749 --> 02:29:56,787
I DO NOT BELIEVEHE SAID THERE 

3590
02:29:56,787 --> 02:30:01,792
IS AN EXCEPTION ANY MORE THAN 

3591
02:30:01,792 --> 02:30:06,763
THERE IS A -- EX ACCEPTS OR AN 

3592

ASIAN OR LATIN EXCEPTION.     

3593
02:30:09,600 --> 02:30:19,810
HE WON AGAINST THE TEMPTATION OF

3594
02:30:19,810 --> 02:30:23,080
WITHDRAWAL FROM --.  

3595
02:30:23,080 --> 02:30:27,752
OUR LEADERSHIP AND IDEALS ARE 

3596
02:30:27,752 --> 02:30:27,985
ABSENT. 

3597
02:30:27,985 --> 02:30:32,823
WE WOULD NOT DESERVEIT.      

3598
02:30:32,823 --> 02:30:36,627
IN THIS MANNER, JOHN McCAIN'S 

3599
02:30:36,627 --> 02:30:41,966
NAME BECAME SYNONYMOUS  WITH AN 

3600
02:30:41,966 --> 02:30:47,338
AMERICA THAT REACHED OUT  TO

02:30:47,338 --> 02:30:49,139
OBLIGUE THE POWERFUL -- AND 

3602

3603
02:30:59,150 --> 02:31:04,788
JOHN WITH WILL -- HE WAS IN THE 

3604
02:31:04,788 --> 02:31:08,692
FRONT LINES OF ALL THESE -- FOR 

3605
02:31:08,692 --> 02:31:10,527
DECENCY AND FREEDOM. 

3606
02:31:10,527 --> 02:31:14,932
HE WAS AN ENGAGEDWARRIOR.    

3607
02:31:14,932 --> 02:31:20,171
FIGHTING FOR HIS CAUSES WITH 

3608
02:31:20,171 --> 02:31:25,142
COURAGE AND WITH HUMILITY TO 

3609
02:31:25,142 --> 02:31:32,583
THE LIMIT OF THE FEASIBLE.     

3610
02:31:32,583 --> 02:31:40,524
AND SOMETIMES MIRACULOUSLY. 

3611
02:31:40,524 --> 02:31:48,666
JOHNWAS ALL ABOUT HOPE.     

3612
02:31:48,666 --> 02:31:52,203
IN A COMMENCEMENT SPEECH JOHN 

3613
02:31:52,203 --> 02:31:58,509
SUMMED UP  THE ESSENCE OF ITS 

3614
02:31:58,509 --> 02:32:02,513
ENGAGEMENT OF A LIFETIME.     

3615
02:32:02,513 --> 02:32:08,085
NO ONE OF US   IF THEY HAVE 

3616
02:32:08,085 --> 02:32:12,523
CHARACTER  LEAVES BEHIND  A 

3617
02:32:12,523 --> 02:32:20,464
WASTED LIFE.     

3618
02:32:20,464 --> 02:32:28,605
LIKE MOST PEOPLE  OF MY AGE I 

3619
02:32:28,605 --> 02:32:32,676
FEEL A LONGING FOR WHAT IS LOST 

3620
02:32:32,676 --> 02:32:42,286
AND CANNOT BE RESTORED.  

3621
02:32:42,286 --> 02:32:48,626
BUT IF -- BEAUTY OF YOUTH -- 

3622
02:32:48,626 --> 02:32:51,929
SOMETHING BETTER CAN ENDURE.    

3623
02:32:51,929 --> 02:32:55,165
AND ENDURE UNTIL OUR LAST 

3624
02:32:55,165 --> 02:33:00,104
MOMENTS.      

3625
02:33:00,104 --> 02:33:08,479
AND THAT IS  THE --   AND THE 

3626
02:33:08,479 --> 02:33:11,281
LOVING GIFT AND A MOMENT IN OUR 

3627
02:33:11,281 --> 02:33:12,049
LIVES WHEN WE SACRIFICE FOR 

3628
02:33:12,049 --> 02:33:15,986
SOMETHING  GREATER.    

3629
02:33:15,986 --> 02:33:22,793
THAN OURSELVES.      

3630
02:33:22,793 --> 02:33:24,628
HEROES, INSIDE EXPIRE US, BY 

3631
02:33:24,628 --> 02:33:28,632

THEIR SACRIFICE.     

3633
02:33:33,304 --> 02:33:39,076
AND THE ELEVATION OF THEIR 

3634
02:33:39,076 --> 02:33:41,745
VISION. THE WORLD WILL BE 

3635
02:33:41,745 --> 02:33:45,716
LONELIER WITHOUT JOHN McCAIN. 

3636
02:33:45,716 --> 02:33:53,223
FORE   HIS FAITH IN AMERICA,  

3637
02:33:53,223 --> 02:33:54,992
AND HIS INSTINCT ACTIVE SENSE 

3638
02:33:54,992 --> 02:33:59,063
OF MORAL DUTY.      

3639
02:33:59,063 --> 02:34:05,102
NONE OF US  WILL EVER FORGET  

3640
02:34:05,102 --> 02:34:08,738
HOW EVEN IN HIS PARTING JOHN 

3641

HAS RESTORED ON US A MUCH 

3642
02:34:12,275 --> 02:34:18,282
NEEDED MOMENT OF UNITY.

AND A RENEWED FAITH IN THE

AND GRATITUDE FOR JOHN McCAIN.  

3655
02:40:03,226 --> 02:40:08,398
SOME LIVES ARE SO VIVID  IT'S 

3656
02:40:08,398 --> 02:40:08,931
DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THEM 

3657
02:40:08,931 --> 02:40:11,535
ENDED.    

3658
02:40:11,535 --> 02:40:15,505
SOME VOICES ARE SO VIBRANT AND 

3659
02:40:15,505 --> 02:40:16,406
DISTINCTIVE IT'S HARD TO THINK 

3660
02:40:16,406 --> 02:40:19,242
OF THEM --   A MAN WHO SELDOM 

3661
02:40:19,242 --> 02:40:25,582
RESTED IS LAID TO REST.      

3662
02:40:25,582 --> 02:40:29,219
AND HIS ABSENCE IS TANGIBLE 

3663
02:40:29,219 --> 02:40:31,788
LIKE THE SILENCE AFTER A MIGHTY 

3664
02:40:31,788 --> 02:40:32,622
ROARING. 

3665
02:40:32,622 --> 02:40:36,293
THE THING ABOUT JOHN'SLIFE WAS 

3666
02:40:36,293 --> 02:40:36,926
THE AMAZING SWEEP OF IT, FROM A 

3667
02:40:36,926 --> 02:40:38,428
TINY PRISON CELL IN VIETNAM TO 

3668
02:40:38,428 --> 02:40:40,530
THE FLOOR OF THE UNITED STATES 

3669
02:40:40,530 --> 02:40:45,068
SENATE.    

3670
02:40:45,068 --> 02:40:46,369
FROM TROUBLE MAKING TO 

3671
02:40:46,369 --> 02:40:47,871
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. 

3672
02:40:47,871 --> 02:40:49,172
WHEREVER JOHN PASSED THROUGHOUT 

3673
02:40:49,172 --> 02:40:51,808
THE WORLD PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY 

3674
02:40:51,808 --> 02:40:52,375
KNEW THERE WAS A LEADER IN 

3675
02:40:52,375 --> 02:40:55,178
THEIR MIDST. 

3676
02:40:55,178 --> 02:40:56,480
ONE EPIC LIFE WASWRITTEN THE 

3677
02:40:56,480 --> 02:41:00,650
COURAGE AND GREATNESS OF OUR 

3678
02:41:00,650 --> 02:41:01,351
COUNTRY.   

3679
02:41:01,351 --> 02:41:06,657
FOR JOHN AND ME THERE WAS A 

3680
02:41:06,657 --> 02:41:07,290
PERSON JOURNEY, OUR HARD FOUGHT 

3681
02:41:07,290 --> 02:41:07,724
POLITICAL HISTORY. 

3682
02:41:07,724 --> 02:41:08,625
BACK IN THEDAY HE COULD 

3683
02:41:08,625 --> 02:41:11,228
FRUSTRATE ME.      

3684
02:41:11,228 --> 02:41:12,962
AND I KNOW HE'D SAY THE SAME 

3685
02:41:12,962 --> 02:41:14,631
THING ABOUT ME.     

3686
02:41:14,631 --> 02:41:19,169
BUT HE ALSO MADE ME BETTER.     

3687
02:41:19,169 --> 02:41:21,370
IN RECENT YEARS WE SOMETIMES 

3688
02:41:21,370 --> 02:41:22,806
TALK OF THAT INTENSE PERIOD 

3689
02:41:22,806 --> 02:41:26,910
LIKE FOOTBALL PLAYERS.    

3690
02:41:26,910 --> 02:41:30,814
REMEMBERING A BIG GAME. 

3691
02:41:30,814 --> 02:41:33,884
IN THE PROCESS RIVALRYMELTED 

3692
02:41:33,884 --> 02:41:34,084
AWAY. 

3693
02:41:34,084 --> 02:41:37,019
IN THE END I GOTTO ENJOY ONE OF 

3694
02:41:37,019 --> 02:41:40,524
LIFE'S GREAT GIFTS, THE 

3695
02:41:40,524 --> 02:41:43,193
FRIENDSHIP OF JOHN McCAIN AND 

3696
02:41:43,193 --> 02:41:46,096
I'LL MISS HIM. 

3697
02:41:46,096 --> 02:41:47,130
MOMENTS BEFORE MY LAST DEBATE 

3698
02:41:47,130 --> 02:41:51,568
EVER  WITH SENATOR JOHN KERRY 

3699
02:41:51,568 --> 02:41:53,002
IN PHOENIX I WAS TRYING TO 

3700
02:41:53,002 --> 02:41:55,672
GATHER SOME THOUGHTS IN THE 

3701
02:41:55,672 --> 02:41:56,005
HOLDING ROOM. 

3702
02:41:56,005 --> 02:41:58,642
I FELT A PRESENCE, OPENED MY 

3703
02:41:58,642 --> 02:42:03,813
EYES  AND 6 INCHES FROM MY FACE 

3704
02:42:03,813 --> 02:42:04,413
WAS McCAIN WHO YELLED RELAX, 

3705
02:42:04,413 --> 02:42:11,788
RELAX.       

3706
02:42:11,788 --> 02:42:16,759
JOHN WAS ABOVE ALL A MAN WITH A 

3707
02:42:16,759 --> 02:42:19,196
CODE  PUBLIC VIRTUES THAT 

3708
02:42:19,196 --> 02:42:20,763
BROUGHT STRENGTH AND PURPOSE TO 

3709
02:42:20,763 --> 02:42:24,467
HIS LIFE AND TO HIS COUNTRY. 

3710
02:42:24,467 --> 02:42:25,535
HE WASCOURAGE I COULDN'T SAY 

3711
02:42:25,535 --> 02:42:28,472
WITH A COURAGE THAT FLIGHTENED 

3712
02:42:28,472 --> 02:42:31,274
TWICE CAP TORNADOS AND INSPIRED 

3713
02:42:31,274 --> 02:42:33,376
HIS COUNTRYMEN. 

3714
02:42:33,376 --> 02:42:36,580
HE WAS HONEST NOMATTER WHOM IT 

3715
02:42:36,580 --> 02:42:36,947
OFFENDED. 

3716
02:42:36,947 --> 02:42:40,483
PRESIDENTS WERE NOT SPARED.     

3717
02:42:40,483 --> 02:42:43,186
HE WAS HONORABLE, ALWAYS 

3718
02:42:43,186 --> 02:42:47,123
RECOGNIZING THAT HIS OPPONENTS 

3719
02:42:47,123 --> 02:42:48,225
WERE STILL PATRIOTS AND HUMAN 

3720
02:42:48,225 --> 02:42:48,458
BEINGS. 

3721
02:42:48,458 --> 02:42:48,992
HELOVED FREEDOM WITH THE 

3722
02:42:48,992 --> 02:42:52,629
PASSION OF A MAN WHO KNEW ITS 

3723
02:42:52,629 --> 02:42:53,597
ABSENCE. 

3724
02:42:53,597 --> 02:42:55,332
HE RESPECTED THE DIGNITY 

3725
02:42:55,332 --> 02:42:56,633
INHERIT IN EVERY LIFE, A 

3726
02:42:56,633 --> 02:43:00,570
DIGNITY THAT DOES NOT STOP AT 

3727
02:43:00,570 --> 02:43:04,774
BORDERS AND CANNOT BE ERASED BY 

3728
02:43:04,774 --> 02:43:06,209
DICTATORS. 

3729
02:43:06,209 --> 02:43:08,144
PERHAPS OF ALL JOHN PROTESTED 

3730
02:43:08,144 --> 02:43:10,046
THE ABUSE OF POWER.     

3731
02:43:10,046 --> 02:43:11,948
THERE WAS SOMETHING DEEP INSIDE 

3732
02:43:11,948 --> 02:43:16,253
HIM THAT MADE HIM STAND UP FOR 

3733
02:43:16,253 --> 02:43:16,853
THE LITTLE GUY TO SPEAK FOR 

3734
02:43:16,853 --> 02:43:17,487
FORGOTTEN PEOPLE AND FORGOTTEN 

3735
02:43:17,487 --> 02:43:21,224
PLACES.      

3736
02:43:21,224 --> 02:43:25,262
WHEN FRIEND FROM HIS NAVAL 

3737
02:43:25,262 --> 02:43:28,031
ACADEMY DAYS RECALLS WHILE JOHN 

3738
02:43:28,031 --> 02:43:31,334
REACTED TO SEEING AN 

3739
02:43:31,334 --> 02:43:33,236
UPPERCLASSMAN VERBALLY ABUSE A 

3740
02:43:33,236 --> 02:43:35,272
STEWARD. 

3741
02:43:35,272 --> 02:43:35,872
AGAINST ALL TRADITIONHE TOLD 

3742
02:43:35,872 --> 02:43:37,139
THE JERK TO PICK ON SOMEONE HIS 

3743
02:43:37,139 --> 02:43:37,406
OWN SIZE. 

3744
02:43:37,406 --> 02:43:40,043
IT WAS AFAMILIAR REFRAIN DURING 

3745
02:43:40,043 --> 02:43:43,380
HIS 6 DECADES OF SERVICE.     

3746
02:43:43,380 --> 02:43:44,714
-WORD WHERE DOES SUCH STRENGTH 

3747
02:43:44,714 --> 02:43:47,684
AND CONVICTION COME FROM, 

3748
02:43:47,684 --> 02:43:49,619
PERHAPS FROM FAMILY WHERE HONOR 

3749
02:43:49,619 --> 02:43:51,253
WAS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OR FROM 

3750
02:43:51,253 --> 02:43:53,589
THE FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE OF 

3751
02:43:53,589 --> 02:43:56,893
CRUELTY WHICH LEFT PHYSICAL 

3752
02:43:56,893 --> 02:44:00,363
REMINDERS THAT LASTED HIS WHOLE 

3753
02:44:00,363 --> 02:44:01,631
LIFE OR SOME DEEP WE FEEL MORAL 

3754
02:44:01,631 --> 02:44:03,266
PRINCIPLE. 

3755
02:44:03,266 --> 02:44:04,634
WHATEVER THE CAUSE,IT WAS THIS 

3756
02:44:04,634 --> 02:44:06,503
COMBINATION OF COURAGE AND 

3757
02:44:06,503 --> 02:44:08,171
DECENCY THAT DEFINED JOHN'S 

3758
02:44:08,171 --> 02:44:10,173
CALLING AND SO CLOSELY 

3759
02:44:10,173 --> 02:44:11,007
PARALLELED THE CALLING OF HIS 

3760
02:44:11,007 --> 02:44:12,475
COUNTRY.     

3761
02:44:12,475 --> 02:44:16,479
IT'S THIS COMBINATION OF 

3762
02:44:16,479 --> 02:44:20,583
COURAGE AND DECENCY THAT MAKES 

3763
02:44:20,583 --> 02:44:24,120
-- AND UNLIVELIED POWER FOR 

3764
02:44:24,120 --> 02:44:24,320
GOOD. 

3765
02:44:24,320 --> 02:44:24,954
IT'STHIS COMBINATION OF COURAGE 

3766
02:44:24,954 --> 02:44:27,656
AND DECENCY THAT SET AMERICA ON 

3767
02:44:27,656 --> 02:44:31,528
A JOURNEY INTO THE WORLD TO 

3768
02:44:31,528 --> 02:44:34,698
LIBERATE DEATH CAMPS, STAND 

3769
02:44:34,698 --> 02:44:37,234
GUARD AGAINST EXTREMISM AND A 

3770
02:44:37,234 --> 02:44:38,835
WORK FOR TRUE PEACE THAT COMES 

3771
02:44:38,835 --> 02:44:40,603
ONLY WITH FREEDOM. 

3772
02:44:40,603 --> 02:44:43,306
JOHN FELTTHESE COMMITMENTS IN 

3773
02:44:43,306 --> 02:44:44,673
HIS BONES, IT IS A TRIBUTE TO 

3774
02:44:44,673 --> 02:44:45,841
HIS MORAL COMPASS THAT 

3775
02:44:45,841 --> 02:44:47,577
PRISONERS IN SO MANY PLACES 

3776
02:44:47,577 --> 02:44:49,111
FROM RUSSIA TO NORTH KOREA TO 

3777
02:44:49,111 --> 02:44:51,348
CHINA KNEW THAT HE WAS ON THEIR 

3778
02:44:51,348 --> 02:44:54,751
SIDE.      

3779
02:44:54,751 --> 02:44:56,653
AND I THINK THEIR RESPECT MEANT 

3780
02:44:56,653 --> 02:44:59,122
MORE TO HIM  THAN ANY MEDALS 

3781
02:44:59,122 --> 02:45:00,623
AND HONORS LIFE COULD BRING.    

3782
02:45:00,623 --> 02:45:06,930
THE PASSION FOR FAIRNESS AND 

3783
02:45:06,930 --> 02:45:07,497
JUSTICE EXTENDED TO OUR OWN 

3784
02:45:07,497 --> 02:45:09,099
MILITARY. 

3785
02:45:09,099 --> 02:45:11,334
WHEN A PRIVATE WAS POORLY 

3786
02:45:11,334 --> 02:45:12,735
EQUIPPED JOHN ENJOYED NOTHING 

3787
02:45:12,735 --> 02:45:17,340
MORE THAN DRESSING DOWN AN 

3788
02:45:17,340 --> 02:45:19,676
ADMIRAL OR A GENERAL, HE 

3789
02:45:19,676 --> 02:45:21,778
REMAINED A TROUBLESOME -- UNTIL 

3790
02:45:21,778 --> 02:45:24,581
THE END. 

3791
02:45:24,581 --> 02:45:28,351
THOSE IN POLITICALPOWER WERE 

3792
02:45:28,351 --> 02:45:28,651
NOT EXEMPT. 

3793
02:45:28,651 --> 02:45:29,118
ATVARIOUS POINTS JOHN 

3794
02:45:29,118 --> 02:45:31,221
CONFRONTED POLICIES AND 

3795
02:45:31,221 --> 02:45:32,688
PRACTICES HE BELIEVED WERE 

3796
02:45:32,688 --> 02:45:34,056
UNWORTHY TO HIS COUNTRY. 

3797
02:45:34,056 --> 02:45:35,758
JOHN McCAIN WOULDINSIST WE'RE 

3798
02:45:35,758 --> 02:45:36,793
BETTER THAN THIS.   

3799
02:45:36,793 --> 02:45:40,263
AMERICA IS BETTER THAN THIS.    

3800
02:45:40,263 --> 02:45:43,399
JOHN IS THE FIRST TO TELL YOU 

3801
02:45:43,399 --> 02:45:48,071
IS NOT A PERFECT MAN BUT HE 

3802
02:45:48,071 --> 02:45:48,704
DEDICATED HIS LIFE TO NATIONAL 

3803
02:45:48,704 --> 02:45:52,409
IDEALS THAT ARE AS PERFECT AS 

3804
02:45:52,409 --> 02:45:52,909
MEN AND WOMEN HAVE YET 

3805
02:45:52,909 --> 02:45:53,209
CONCEIVED. 

3806
02:45:53,209 --> 02:45:55,378
HE WASMOTIVATED BY A VISION OF 

3807
02:45:55,378 --> 02:45:56,913
AMERICA CARRIED EVER FORWARD 

3808
02:45:56,913 --> 02:45:58,915
EVER UPWARD ON THE STRENGTH OF 

3809
02:45:58,915 --> 02:46:00,583
ITS PRINCIPLES.     

3810
02:46:00,583 --> 02:46:02,752
HE SAW OUR COUNTRY NOT ONLY AS 

3811
02:46:02,752 --> 02:46:04,687
A PHYSICAL PLACE OR POWER, BUT 

3812
02:46:04,687 --> 02:46:07,490
AS THE CARRIER OF ENDURING 

3813
02:46:07,490 --> 02:46:09,192
HUMAN ASPIRATIONS.    

3814
02:46:09,192 --> 02:46:12,629
AS AN ADVOCATE FOR THE 

3815
02:46:12,629 --> 02:46:16,533
OPPRESSED, AS A DEFENDER OF THE 

3816
02:46:16,533 --> 02:46:18,100
PEACE, AS A PROMISE UNWAVERING, 

3817
02:46:18,100 --> 02:46:19,736
UNEQUAL.     

3818
02:46:19,736 --> 02:46:23,806
THE STRENGTH OF A DEMOCRACY IS 

3819
02:46:23,806 --> 02:46:25,308
RENEWED BY REAFFIRMING THE 

3820
02:46:25,308 --> 02:46:28,678
PRINCIPLES ON WHICH IT WAS 

3821
02:46:28,678 --> 02:46:28,945
FOUNDED. 

3822
02:46:28,945 --> 02:46:31,314
ANDAMERICA HAS SOMEHOW ALWAYS 

3823
02:46:31,314 --> 02:46:32,582
FOUND LEADERS HONOR UP TO THAT 

3824
02:46:32,582 --> 02:46:35,852
TASK PARTICULARLY AT THE TIME 

3825
02:46:35,852 --> 02:46:36,252
OF GREATEST NEED. 

3826
02:46:36,252 --> 02:46:39,989
JOHN WAS BORN TOMEET THAT KIND 

3827
02:46:39,989 --> 02:46:40,556
OF CHALLENGE, TO DEFEND AND 

3828
02:46:40,556 --> 02:46:42,024
DEMONSTRATE THE DEFINING IDEA 

3829
02:46:42,024 --> 02:46:45,061
Y'ALLS OF OUR NATION.     

3830
02:46:45,061 --> 02:46:51,935
FOREVER TEMPTED TO FORGET WHO 

3831
02:46:51,935 --> 02:46:52,635
WE ARE, GROW WEARY OF OUR CAUSE 

3832
02:46:52,635 --> 02:46:55,004
JOHN'S VOICE WILL ALWAYS COME 

3833
02:46:55,004 --> 02:46:56,840
AS A WHISPER OVER OUR SHOULDER. 

3834
02:46:56,840 --> 02:47:00,009
WE'RE BETTER THAN THIS. 

3835
02:47:00,009 --> 02:47:03,813
AMERICAIS BETTER THAN THIS. 

3836
02:47:03,813 --> 02:47:04,481
JOHN WAS ARESTLESS SOUL. 

3837
02:47:04,481 --> 02:47:07,283
HE DIDN'T GLORYIN SUCCESS OR 

3838
02:47:07,283 --> 02:47:08,585
WALL LOW IN FAILURE BECAUSE HE 

3839
02:47:08,585 --> 02:47:12,622
WAS ALL ONTO THE NEXT THING. 

3840
02:47:12,622 --> 02:47:13,256
FRIENDS SAID HECAN'T STAY IN 

3841
02:47:13,256 --> 02:47:14,490
THE SAME EXPERIENCE. 

3842
02:47:14,490 --> 02:47:17,093
ONE OF THE HISBOOKS ENDED WITH 

3843
02:47:17,093 --> 02:47:19,362
THE WORDS AND I MOVED ON. 

3844
02:47:19,362 --> 02:47:21,197
JOHN HAS MOVED ON.

3845
02:47:21,197 --> 02:47:23,733
HE WOULD PROBABLY NOT WANT TO 

3846
02:47:23,733 --> 02:47:24,700
US DWELL ON IT BUT BETTER FOR 

3847
02:47:24,700 --> 02:47:27,871
HIS PRESENCE AMONG US. 

3848
02:47:27,871 --> 02:47:28,605
THE WORLD ISSMALL ARE FOR HIS 

3849
02:47:28,605 --> 02:47:31,207
DEPARTURE AND WE'LL REMEMBER 

3850
02:47:31,207 --> 02:47:31,941
HIM AS HE WAS, UNWAVERING, 

3851
02:47:31,941 --> 02:48:17,854
UNEQUAL.  

3852
02:48:36,473 --> 02:48:40,643
TO JOHN'S BELOVED FAMILY, MRS. 

3853
02:48:40,643 --> 02:48:44,113
McCAIN, AND THE McCAIN 

3854
02:48:44,113 --> 02:48:52,522
CHILDREN,    PRESIDENT, MRS. 

3855
02:48:52,522 --> 02:48:55,825
BUSH, VICE PRESIDENT, AND AS 

3856
02:48:55,825 --> 02:49:00,630
JOHN WOULD SAY MY FRIENDS.     

3857
02:49:00,630 --> 02:49:03,833
WE COME TO CELEBRATE  AN 

3858
02:49:03,833 --> 02:49:07,971
EXTRAORDINARY MAN.     

3859
02:49:07,971 --> 02:49:10,906
A WARRIOR  A STATESMAN, A 

3860
02:49:10,906 --> 02:49:15,645
PATRIOT.      

3861
02:49:15,645 --> 02:49:17,780
WHO EMBODIED SO MUCH  THAT IS 

3862
02:49:17,780 --> 02:49:21,417
BEST IN AMERICA.      

3863
02:49:21,417 --> 02:49:25,020
PRESIDENT BUSH AND I ARE AMONG 

3864
02:49:25,020 --> 02:49:26,221
THE FORTUNATE FEW WHO COMPETED 

3865
02:49:26,221 --> 02:49:28,457
AGAINST JOHN AT THE HIGHEST 

3866
02:49:28,457 --> 02:49:30,393
LEVELS OF POLITICS.  

3867
02:49:30,393 --> 02:49:33,196
HE MADE US BETTER PRESIDENTS.   

3868
02:49:33,196 --> 02:49:34,564
JUST AS HE MADE THE SENATE 

3869
02:49:34,564 --> 02:49:37,333
BETTER.      

3870
02:49:37,333 --> 02:49:37,933
JUST AS HE MADE THIS COUNTRY 

3871
02:49:37,933 --> 02:49:41,170
BETTER.      

3872
02:49:41,170 --> 02:49:43,339
SO FOR SOMEONE LIKE JOHN TO ASK 

3873
02:49:43,339 --> 02:49:49,779
YOU WHILE HE'S STILL ALIVE  TO 

3874
02:49:49,779 --> 02:49:51,747
STAND AND SPEAK OF HIM WHEN 

3875
02:49:51,747 --> 02:49:57,353
HE'S GONE  IS A PRESSURES AND 

3876
02:49:57,353 --> 02:49:59,756
SINGULAR HONOR. 

3877
02:49:59,756 --> 02:50:00,623
NOW, WHEN JOHNCALLED ME WITH 

3878
02:50:00,623 --> 02:50:02,925
THAT REQUEST EARLIER THIS YEAR 

3879
02:50:02,925 --> 02:50:06,963
I'LL ADMIT  SADNESS,    AND 

3880
02:50:06,963 --> 02:50:08,898
ALSO A CERTAIN SURPRISE.     

3881
02:50:08,898 --> 02:50:11,867
BUT AFTER  OUR CONVERSATION 

3882
02:50:11,867 --> 02:50:16,472
ENDED I REALIZED HOW WELL IT 

3883
02:50:16,472 --> 02:50:17,573
CAPTURED SOME OF JOHN'S 

3884
02:50:17,573 --> 02:50:18,040
ESSENTIAL QUALITIES. 

3885
02:50:18,040 --> 02:50:20,677
TOSTART WITH JOHN LIKED BEING 

3886
02:50:20,677 --> 02:50:27,483
UNPREDICTABLE.      

3887
02:50:27,483 --> 02:50:29,986
EVEN A LITTLE CONTRARIAN. 

3888
02:50:29,986 --> 02:50:31,621
HE HAD NO INTEREST COULD 

3889
02:50:31,621 --> 02:50:32,922
CONFORMING OF SOME PREPACKAGED 

3890
02:50:32,922 --> 02:50:34,423
VERSION OF WHAT SOME SENATOR 

3891
02:50:34,423 --> 02:50:35,524
SHOULD BE AND DIDN'T WANT A 

3892
02:50:35,524 --> 02:50:36,492
MEMORIAL THAT WAS GOING TO BE 

3893
02:50:36,492 --> 02:50:41,764
PRE PACKAGED EITHER.      

3894
02:50:41,764 --> 02:50:43,866
IT ALSO SHOWED JOHN'S DISDAIN 

3895
02:50:43,866 --> 02:50:46,969
FOR SELF PIT TEE.     

3896
02:50:46,969 --> 02:50:49,438
HE HAD BEEN TO HELL AND BACK 

3897
02:50:49,438 --> 02:50:53,108
AND YET SOMEHOW NEVER LOST  HIS 

3898
02:50:53,108 --> 02:50:55,945
ENERGY OR HIS OPTIMISM OR HIS 

3899
02:50:55,945 --> 02:50:57,380
ZEST FOR LIFE.   

3900
02:50:57,380 --> 02:51:00,049
SO CANCER DID NOT SCARE HIM.    

3901
02:51:00,049 --> 02:51:04,520
AND HE WOULD MAINTAIN THAT 

3902
02:51:04,520 --> 02:51:07,323
SPIRIT AT THE VERY END, TOO 

3903
02:51:07,323 --> 02:51:10,493
STUBBORN TO SIT STILL,  OPINION 

3904
02:51:10,493 --> 02:51:13,462
WATERED AS EVER, FIERCELY 

3905
02:51:13,462 --> 02:51:15,665
DEVOTED TO HIS FRIENDS AND MOST 

3906
02:51:15,665 --> 02:51:22,305
OF ALL TO HIS FAMILY.       

3907
02:51:22,305 --> 02:51:26,075
IT SHOWED HIS IRREVERANCE, 

3908
02:51:26,075 --> 02:51:27,977
SENSE OF HUMOR, A LITTLE BIT OF 

3909
02:51:27,977 --> 02:51:30,113
A -- AFTER ALL WHAT BETTER WAY 

3910
02:51:30,113 --> 02:51:31,447
TO GET A LAST LAUGH THAN TO 

3911
02:51:31,447 --> 02:51:32,582
MAKE GEORGE AND I SAY NICE 

3912
02:51:32,582 --> 02:51:36,486
THINGS ABOUT HIM TO A NATIONAL 

3913
02:51:36,486 --> 02:51:48,064
AUDIENCE.      

3914
02:51:48,064 --> 02:51:51,567
MOST OF ALL IT SHOWED A 

3915
02:51:51,567 --> 02:51:52,034
LARGENESS OF SPIRIT. 

3916
02:51:52,034 --> 02:51:55,204
AN ABILITYTO SEE PAST 

3917
02:51:55,204 --> 02:51:56,238
DIFFERENCES IN SEARCH OF COMMON 

3918
02:51:56,238 --> 02:51:58,841
GROUND.    

3919
02:51:58,841 --> 02:52:00,643
AND IN FACT, ON THE SURFACE 

3920
02:52:00,643 --> 02:52:01,277
JOHN AND I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN 

3921
02:52:01,277 --> 02:52:05,281
MORE DIFFERENT.     

3922
02:52:05,281 --> 02:52:07,050
WE'RE OF DIFFERENT GENERATIONS, 

3923
02:52:07,050 --> 02:52:08,784
I CAME FROM A BROKEN HOME AND 

3924
02:52:08,784 --> 02:52:15,191
NEVER KNEW MY FATHER.     

3925
02:52:15,191 --> 02:52:17,693
JOHN WAS THE -- ONE OF 

3926
02:52:17,693 --> 02:52:19,328
AMERICA'S MOST -- FAMILIES. 

3927
02:52:19,328 --> 02:52:21,463
IHAVE A REPUTATION FOR KEEPING 

3928
02:52:21,463 --> 02:52:29,806
COOL,  JOHN NOT SO MUCH.     

3929
02:52:29,806 --> 02:52:32,575
WE WERE STANDARD BEARERS OF 

3930
02:52:32,575 --> 02:52:35,278
DIFFERENT AMERICAN POLITICAL 

3931
02:52:35,278 --> 02:52:36,479
TRADITIONS AND THROUGHOUT MY 

3932
02:52:36,479 --> 02:52:38,181
PRESIDENCY JOHN NEVER HESITATED 

3933
02:52:38,181 --> 02:52:40,950
TO TELL ME WHEN HE THOUGHT I 

3934
02:52:40,950 --> 02:52:43,151
WAS SCREWING UP WHICH BY HIS 

3935
02:52:43,151 --> 02:52:46,723
CALCULATION WAS ONCE A DAY.     

3936
02:52:46,723 --> 02:52:49,358
BUT FOR ALL OUR DIFFERENCES,  

3937
02:52:49,358 --> 02:52:52,828
FOR ALL THE TIMES WE SPARRED, I 

3938
02:52:52,828 --> 02:52:54,730
NEVER TRIED TO HIDE AND I THINK 

3939
02:52:54,730 --> 02:52:59,068
JOHN  CAME TO UNDERSTAND  THE 

3940
02:52:59,068 --> 02:53:00,135
LONG-STANDING ADMIRATION THAT I 

3941
02:53:00,135 --> 02:53:06,642
HAD FOR HIM.      

3942
02:53:06,642 --> 02:53:09,144
BY HIS ON ACCOUNT JOHN WAS A 

3943
02:53:09,144 --> 02:53:11,647
REBEL I COULDN'T SAY YOUNG MAN. 

3944
02:53:11,647 --> 02:53:13,749
IN HIS CASE THAT'S

3945
02:53:13,749 --> 02:53:15,685
UNDERSTANDABLE WHAT FASTER WAY 

3946
02:53:15,685 --> 02:53:20,556
TO DISTINGUISH YOURSELF THAN TO 

3947
02:53:20,556 --> 02:53:22,091
MUTINY.  

3948
02:53:22,091 --> 02:53:23,659
EVENTUALLY THOUGH HE CONCLUDED 

3949
02:53:23,659 --> 02:53:25,060
THAT THE ONLY WAY TO REALLY 

3950
02:53:25,060 --> 02:53:26,094
MAKE HIS MARK ON THE WORLD IS 

3951
02:53:26,094 --> 02:53:28,230
TO COMMIT  TO SOMETHING BIGGER 

3952
02:53:28,230 --> 02:53:30,433
THAN YOURSELF.    

3953
02:53:30,433 --> 02:53:31,167
AND FOR JOHN THAT MEANT 

3954
02:53:31,167 --> 02:53:33,535
ANSWERING  THE HIGHEST OF 

3955
02:53:33,535 --> 02:53:35,338
CALLINGS.     

3956
02:53:35,338 --> 02:53:37,206
SERVING HIS COUNTRY  IN A TIME 

3957
02:53:37,206 --> 02:53:43,513
OF WAR.      

3958
02:53:43,513 --> 02:53:45,448
OTHERS THIS WEEK AND THIS 

3959
02:53:45,448 --> 02:53:50,620
MORNING HAVE SPOKEN  TO THE 

3960
02:53:50,620 --> 02:53:52,621
DEPTHS OF HIS ORMENT AND THE 

3961
02:53:52,621 --> 02:53:56,225
DEPTHS OF HIS COURAGE THERE IN 

3962
02:53:56,225 --> 02:53:59,662
THE CELLS OF HANOI WHEN DAY 

3963
02:53:59,662 --> 02:54:02,264
AFTER DAY, YEAR AFTER YEAR  THE 

3964
02:54:02,264 --> 02:54:03,666
YOUTHFUL IRON WAS TEMPERED INTO 

3965
02:54:03,666 --> 02:54:08,271
STEEL.      

3966
02:54:08,271 --> 02:54:12,708
AND IT BRINGS TO MIND SOMETHING 

3967
02:54:12,708 --> 02:54:14,744
THAT HEMMINGWAY WROTE AND THE 

3968
02:54:14,744 --> 02:54:16,479
BROKE REFERRED TO, HIS FAVORITE 

3969
02:54:16,479 --> 02:54:20,783
WORK, TODAY ONLY ONE DAY  IN 

3970
02:54:20,783 --> 02:54:23,119
ALL THE DAYS THAT WILL EVER BE  

3971
02:54:23,119 --> 02:54:25,220
BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN  IN ALL 

3972
02:54:25,220 --> 02:54:29,358
THE OTHER DAYS  THAT EVER COME  

3973
02:54:29,358 --> 02:54:32,528
CAN DEPEND  ON WHAT  YOU DO 

3974
02:54:32,528 --> 02:54:35,298
TODAY.      

3975
02:54:40,503 --> 02:54:41,137
IN CAPTIVITY JOHN LEARNED IN 

3976
02:54:41,137 --> 02:54:42,704
WAYS THAT FEW OF US EVER WILL 

3977
02:54:42,704 --> 02:54:46,375
THE MEANING OF THOSE WORDS.     

3978
02:54:46,375 --> 02:54:52,148
HOW EACH MOMENT  EACH DAY  EACH 

3979
02:54:52,148 --> 02:55:00,089
JOYCE IS A TEST.      

3980
02:55:00,089 --> 02:55:01,624
AND JOHN McCAIN PASSED THAT 

3981
02:55:01,624 --> 02:55:04,026
TEST AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. 

3982
02:55:04,026 --> 02:55:07,329
AND THAT'S WHY WHEN JOHN SPOKE 

3983
02:55:07,329 --> 02:55:11,667
OF VIRTUES LIKE SERVICE AND 

3984
02:55:11,667 --> 02:55:16,672
DUTY,  IT DIDN'T RING HOLLOW. 

3985
02:55:16,672 --> 02:55:17,840
THEY WEREN'T JUST WORDS TO HIM. 

3986
02:55:17,840 --> 02:55:18,574
IT WAS A TRUTH THAT HE HAD 

3987
02:55:18,574 --> 02:55:20,509
LIVED.   

3988
02:55:20,509 --> 02:55:24,814
AND FOR WHICH  HE WAS PREPARED 

3989
02:55:24,814 --> 02:55:28,250
TO DIE.   

3990
02:55:28,250 --> 02:55:33,556
AND FORCED EVEN THE MOST  

3991
02:55:33,556 --> 02:55:36,959
CYNICAL TO CONSIDER WHAT WERE 

3992
02:55:36,959 --> 02:55:37,527
WE DOING FOR OUR COUNTRY? 

3993
02:55:37,527 --> 02:55:43,599
WHATMIGHT  WE RISK EVERYTHING 

3994
02:55:43,599 --> 02:55:43,799
FOR? 

3995
02:55:43,799 --> 02:55:48,070
YOU KNOW, MUCH HAS BEENSAID  

3996
02:55:48,070 --> 02:55:51,007
THIS WEEK ABOUT WHAT A  

3997
02:55:51,007 --> 02:55:52,675
MAVERICK JOHN WAS. 

3998
02:55:52,675 --> 02:55:55,344
NOW, INFACT, JOHN WAS A PRETTY 

3999
02:55:55,344 --> 02:55:57,647
CONSERVATIVE GUY, TRUST ME, I 

4000
02:55:57,647 --> 02:55:58,214
WAS ON THE RECEIVING END OF 

4001
02:55:58,214 --> 02:56:04,286
SOME OF THOSE VOTES.     

4002
02:56:04,286 --> 02:56:06,055
BUT HE DID UNDERSTAND THAT SOME 

4003
02:56:06,055 --> 02:56:09,358
PRINCIPLES TRANSCEND POLITICS.  

4004
02:56:09,358 --> 02:56:12,395
THAT SOME VALUES  TRANSCEND 

4005
02:56:12,395 --> 02:56:16,532
PARTY.     

4006
02:56:16,532 --> 02:56:20,335
HE CONSIDERED HIS DUTY TO -- 

4007
02:56:20,335 --> 02:56:24,874
UPHOLD THOSE VALUES.      

4008
02:56:24,874 --> 02:56:26,842
JOHN CARED ABOUT THE 

4009
02:56:26,842 --> 02:56:27,843
INSTITUTIONS OF SELF-

4010
02:56:27,843 --> 02:56:29,612
GOVERNMENT, OUR CONSTITUTION,  

4011
02:56:29,612 --> 02:56:32,481
OUR BILL OF RIGHTS,  RULE OF 

4012
02:56:32,481 --> 02:56:36,585
LAW,  SEPARATION OF POWERS, 

4013
02:56:36,585 --> 02:56:37,586
EVEN THE RULES AND PROCEDURES 

4014
02:56:37,586 --> 02:56:41,423
OF THE SENATE, HE KNEW THAT IN 

4015
02:56:41,423 --> 02:56:45,127
A NATION  AS BIG AND DIVERSE AS 

4016
02:56:45,127 --> 02:56:50,566
OURS  THOSE INSTITUTIONS, THOSE 

4017
02:56:50,566 --> 02:56:51,467
RULES, THOSE NORMS ARE WHAT 

4018
02:56:51,467 --> 02:56:54,804
BIND US TOGETHER.     

4019
02:56:54,804 --> 02:56:55,571
IT GIVES SHAPE AND ORDER TO OUR 

4020
02:56:55,571 --> 02:57:01,210
COMMON LIFE.      

4021
02:57:01,210 --> 02:57:02,445
EVEN WHEN WE DISAGREE, 

4022
02:57:02,445 --> 02:57:06,716
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE DISAGREE.    

4023
02:57:06,716 --> 02:57:11,721
JOHN BELIEVED IN HONEST 

4024
02:57:11,721 --> 02:57:14,523
ARGUMENT AND HEARING OVERVIEWS. 

4025
02:57:14,523 --> 02:57:19,228
HE UNDERSTOOD THAT IF WE GET IN 

4026
02:57:19,228 --> 02:57:21,897
THE HABIT OF BENDING THE TRUTH 

4027
02:57:21,897 --> 02:57:23,132
TO -- OR -- OUR DEMOCRACY WILL 

4028
02:57:23,132 --> 02:57:26,902
NOT WORK.       

4029
02:57:26,902 --> 02:57:28,637
THAT'S WHY HE WAS WILLING TO 

4030
02:57:28,637 --> 02:57:30,506
BUCK HIS OWN PARTY AT TIMES 

4031
02:57:30,506 --> 02:57:34,243
OCCASIONALLY WORK ACROSS THE 

4032
02:57:34,243 --> 02:57:34,876
ISLE ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM 

4033
02:57:34,876 --> 02:57:37,480
AND IMMIGRATION REFORM.  

4034
02:57:37,480 --> 02:57:39,648
THAT'S WHY HE CHAMPIONED A FREE 

4035
02:57:39,648 --> 02:57:42,885
AND INDEPENDENT PRESS  AS VITAL 

4036
02:57:42,885 --> 02:57:44,220
TO OUR DEMOCRATIC DEBATE.      

4037
02:57:44,220 --> 02:57:47,923
AND THE FACT THAT IT EARNED HIM 

4038
02:57:47,923 --> 02:57:48,557
SOME GOOD COVERAGE DIDN'T HURT 

4039
02:57:48,557 --> 02:57:54,997
EITHER.      

4040
02:57:54,997 --> 02:58:01,303
JOHN UNDERSTOOD  AS J.F.K. 

4041
02:58:01,303 --> 02:58:03,305
UNDERSTOOD, RONALD PRE BEGAN 

4042
02:58:03,305 --> 02:58:04,806
UNDERSTOOD THAT PART OF WHAT 

4043
02:58:04,806 --> 02:58:07,209
MAKES OUR COUNTRY GREAT IS THAT 

4044
02:58:07,209 --> 02:58:08,577
OUR MEMBERSHIP IS BASED NOT ON 

4045
02:58:08,577 --> 02:58:10,646
OUR BLOODLINE, NOT ON WHAT WE 

4046
02:58:10,646 --> 02:58:12,047
LOOK LIKE, WHAT OUR LAST NAMES 

4047
02:58:12,047 --> 02:58:15,384
ARE,  IT'S NOT BASED ON WHERE 

4048
02:58:15,384 --> 02:58:18,286
OUR PARENTS OR GRANDPARENTS 

4049
02:58:18,286 --> 02:58:19,889
CAME FROM, OR HOW RECENTLY THEY 

4050
02:58:19,889 --> 02:58:27,396
ARRIVED,  BUT ON ADD HENCE TO A 

4051
02:58:27,396 --> 02:58:31,433
COMMON CREED THAT ALL OF US ARE 

4052
02:58:31,433 --> 02:58:34,436
CREATED EQUAL AND DIE BY OUR 

4053
02:58:34,436 --> 02:58:38,908
CREATOR.       

4054
02:58:38,908 --> 02:58:41,043
IT'S BEEN MENTIONED TODAY  AND 

4055
02:58:41,043 --> 02:58:43,579
WE'VE SEEN FOOTAGE THIS WEEK OF 

4056
02:58:43,579 --> 02:58:47,950
JOHN PUSHING BACK AGAINST 

4057
02:58:47,950 --> 02:58:48,584
SUPPORTERS WHO CHALLENGED MY 

4058
02:58:48,584 --> 02:58:52,621
PATRIOT TIM DURING THE 2008 

4059
02:58:52,621 --> 02:59:17,680
CAMPAIGN, . 

4060
02:59:17,680 --> 02:59:19,381
>>> I'M CERTAIN IN THOSE 

4061
02:59:19,381 --> 02:59:20,015
MOMENTS DURING THE CAMPAIGN HE 

4062
02:59:20,015 --> 02:59:21,250
SAW HIMSELF AS DEFENDING 

4063
02:59:21,250 --> 02:59:22,585
AMERICA'S CHARACTER.     

4064
02:59:22,585 --> 02:59:29,725
NOT JUST MINE.      

4065
02:59:29,725 --> 02:59:31,426
CONSIDERED IT THE IMPERATIVE OF 

4066
02:59:31,426 --> 02:59:32,461
EVERY CITIZEN WHO LOVES THIS 

4067
02:59:32,461 --> 02:59:33,229
COUNTRY TO TREAT ALL PEOPLE 

4068
02:59:33,229 --> 02:59:34,697
FAIRLY.     

4069
02:59:34,697 --> 02:59:40,102
AND FINALLY WHILE JOHN AND I  

4070
02:59:40,102 --> 02:59:42,271
DISAGREED ON ALL KINDS OF 

4071
02:59:42,271 --> 02:59:42,938
FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES, WE STOOD 

4072
02:59:42,938 --> 02:59:49,911
TOGETHER  ON AMERICA'S ROLE  AS 

4073
02:59:49,911 --> 02:59:53,048
THE ONE NATION BELIEVING THAT 

4074
02:59:53,048 --> 02:59:53,615
WITH GREAT POWER AND GREAT 

4075
02:59:53,615 --> 02:59:54,283
BLESSINGS  COMES GREAT 

4076
02:59:54,283 --> 02:59:58,954
RESPONSIBILITY.      

4077
02:59:58,954 --> 03:00:02,825
THAT BURDEN  IS BORNE MOST 

4078
03:00:02,825 --> 03:00:04,159
HEAVILY BY OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN 

4079
03:00:04,159 --> 03:00:11,634
UNIFORM.     

4080
03:00:11,634 --> 03:00:13,602
SERVICE MEMBERS LIKE DOUG, 

4081
03:00:13,602 --> 03:00:15,504
JIMMY AND JACK WHO FOLLOWED 

4082
03:00:15,504 --> 03:00:16,605
THEIR FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS AS 

4083
03:00:16,605 --> 03:00:23,479
WELL AS THE FAMILIES --   BUT 

4084
03:00:23,479 --> 03:00:26,482
JOHN UNDERSTOOD  THAT OUR 

4085
03:00:26,482 --> 03:00:27,382
SECURITY AND OUR INFLUENCE WAS 

4086
03:00:27,382 --> 03:00:33,788
ONE  NOT JUST BY OUR MILITARY 

4087
03:00:33,788 --> 03:00:36,458
MITE, NOT JUST BY OUR WEALTH, 

4088
03:00:36,458 --> 03:00:37,926
NOT JUST BY OUR ABILITY TO BEND 

4089
03:00:37,926 --> 03:00:40,929
OTHERS TO OUR WILL,     BUT 

4090
03:00:40,929 --> 03:00:42,330
FROM OUR CAPACITY TO INSIDE 

4091
03:00:42,330 --> 03:00:49,305
EXPIRE OTHERS.      

4092
03:00:49,305 --> 03:00:50,839
WITH OUR ADHERENCE TO A SET OF 

4093
03:00:50,839 --> 03:00:54,944
UNIVERSAL VALUES LIKE RULE OF 

4094
03:00:54,944 --> 03:01:00,482
LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS AND AN 

4095
03:01:00,482 --> 03:01:02,318
INSISTENCE ON THE GOD GIVEN DIG 

4096
03:01:02,318 --> 03:01:03,785
NIGHT TEE OF EVERY HUMAN BEING. 

4097
03:01:03,785 --> 03:01:04,853
OF COURSE JOHN WAS THE FIRST TO 

4098
03:01:04,853 --> 03:01:06,288
TELL US THAT HE WAS NOT 

4099
03:01:06,288 --> 03:01:08,357
PERFECT.     

4100
03:01:08,357 --> 03:01:12,127
LIKE ALL OF US WHO GO INTO 

4101
03:01:12,127 --> 03:01:16,332
PUBLIC SERVICE  HE DID HAVE AN 

4102
03:01:16,332 --> 03:01:19,434
E GO, LIKE ALL OF US  THERE WAS 

4103
03:01:19,434 --> 03:01:23,238
NO DOUBT SOME VOTES HE CAST  

4104
03:01:23,238 --> 03:01:24,706
SOME COMPROMISES HE STRUCK, 

4105
03:01:24,706 --> 03:01:25,540
SOME DECISIONS HE MADE THAT HE 

4106
03:01:25,540 --> 03:01:29,411
WISHED HE COULD HAVE BACK.      

4107
03:01:29,411 --> 03:01:31,213
IT'S NO SECRET  IT'S BEEN 

4108
03:01:31,213 --> 03:01:32,614
MENTIONED THAT  HE HAD A 

4109
03:01:32,614 --> 03:01:35,718
TEMPER.     

4110
03:01:35,718 --> 03:01:39,154
AND WHEN IT FLARED UP, IT WAS  

4111
03:01:39,154 --> 03:01:42,390
A FORCE OF NATURE, A WONDER TO 

4112
03:01:42,390 --> 03:01:42,624
BEHOLD. 

4113
03:01:42,624 --> 03:01:46,895
HIS JAW GRINDING,FACE 

4114
03:01:46,895 --> 03:01:49,097
REDDENING, HIS EYES BORING A 

4115
03:01:49,097 --> 03:01:50,966
HOLE RIGHT THROUGH YOU, NOT 

4116
03:01:50,966 --> 03:01:52,067
THAT I EVER EXPERIENCED IT 

4117
03:01:52,067 --> 03:01:55,871
FIRST HAND MIND YOU.      

4118
03:01:55,871 --> 03:01:58,107
BUT TO KNOW JOHN WAS TO KNOW 

4119
03:01:58,107 --> 03:01:59,708
THAT AS QUICK AS HIS PASSIONS 

4120
03:01:59,708 --> 03:02:03,312
MIGHT FLARE,  HE WAS JUST AS 

4121
03:02:03,312 --> 03:02:05,514
QUICK TO FORGIVE,  AND ASKED 

4122
03:02:05,514 --> 03:02:08,884
FOR FORGIVENESS.     

4123
03:02:08,884 --> 03:02:12,521
HE KNEW MORE THAN MOST HIS OWN 

4124
03:02:12,521 --> 03:02:15,190
FLAWS AND HIS BLIND SPOTS AND 

4125
03:02:15,190 --> 03:02:18,127
KNEW HOW TO LAUGH AT HIMSELF.   

4126
03:02:18,127 --> 03:02:19,627
AND THE AWARENESS MADE HIM ALL 

4127
03:02:19,627 --> 03:02:21,497
THE MORE COMPELLING.       

4128
03:02:21,497 --> 03:02:24,599
AND WE DIDN'T ADVERTISE IT, BUT 

4129
03:02:24,599 --> 03:02:27,036
EVERY SO OFTEN  OVER THE COURSE 

4130
03:02:27,036 --> 03:02:30,239
OF MY PRESIDENCY  JOHN WOULD 

4131
03:02:30,239 --> 03:02:33,275
COME OVER TO THE WHITE HOUSE,  

4132
03:02:33,275 --> 03:02:36,478
AND WE'D JUST SIT AND TALK IN 

4133
03:02:36,478 --> 03:02:37,345
THE OVAL OFFICE, JUST THE 2 OF 

4134
03:02:37,345 --> 03:02:38,247
US, AND TALK ABOUT POLICY AND 

4135
03:02:38,247 --> 03:02:40,783
TALK ABOUT FAMILY.     

4136
03:02:40,783 --> 03:02:43,017
AND WE'D TALK ABOUT THE STATE 

4137
03:02:43,017 --> 03:02:45,754
OF OUR POLITICS.      

4138
03:02:45,754 --> 03:02:48,057
AND OUR DISAGREEMENTS DIDN'T GO 

4139
03:02:48,057 --> 03:02:49,358
AWAY DURING THESE PRIVATE 

4140
03:02:49,358 --> 03:02:52,961
CONVERSATIONS.     

4141
03:02:52,961 --> 03:02:53,928
THOSE WERE REAL, AND THEY WERE 

4142
03:02:53,928 --> 03:02:58,100
OFTEN DEEP.      

4143
03:02:58,100 --> 03:02:58,700
BUT WE ENJOYED THE TIME WE 

4144
03:02:58,700 --> 03:03:00,436
SHARED  AWAY FROM THE BRIGHT 

4145
03:03:00,436 --> 03:03:02,638
LIGHTS.     

4146
03:03:02,638 --> 03:03:04,840
AND WE LAUGHED WITH EACH OTHER. 

4147
03:03:04,840 --> 03:03:11,981
AND WE LEARNED FROM EACH OTHER. 

4148
03:03:11,981 --> 03:03:15,751
AND WE NEVER DOUBTED THE OTHER 

4149
03:03:15,751 --> 03:03:17,619
MAN'S SINCERITY OR THE OTHER 

4150
03:03:17,619 --> 03:03:19,587
MAN'S PATRIOTISM, THAT WHEN ALL 

4151
03:03:19,587 --> 03:03:20,489
WAS SAID AND DONE WE WERE ON 

4152
03:03:20,489 --> 03:03:25,360
THE SAME TEAM.      

4153
03:03:25,360 --> 03:03:26,295
WE NEVER DOUBTED WE WERE ON THE 

4154
03:03:26,295 --> 03:03:30,699
SAME TEAM.      

4155
03:03:30,699 --> 03:03:35,671
FOR ALL OF OUR DIFFERENCES WE 

4156
03:03:35,671 --> 03:03:37,773
SHARED A FIDELITY TO THE IDEALS 

4157
03:03:37,773 --> 03:03:39,074
FOR WHICH GENERATION OF 

4158
03:03:39,074 --> 03:03:42,744
AMERICANS HAVE MARCHED AND 

4159
03:03:42,744 --> 03:03:43,311
FOUGHT AND SACRIFICED.   

4160
03:03:43,311 --> 03:03:46,682
AND GIVEN THEIR LIVES.      

4161
03:03:46,682 --> 03:03:50,218
WE CONSIDERED OUR POLITICAL 

4162
03:03:50,218 --> 03:03:55,090
BATTLES A PRIVILEGE. 

4163
03:03:55,090 --> 03:04:00,462
AN OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE AS 

4164
03:04:00,462 --> 03:04:01,062
STEWARDS OF THOSE IDEALS HERE 

4165
03:04:01,062 --> 03:04:01,629
AT HOME AND DO OUR BEST TO 

4166
03:04:01,629 --> 03:04:03,565
ADVANCE THEM AROUND THE WORLD. 

4167
03:04:03,565 --> 03:04:04,433
WE SAWTHIS COUNTRY AS A PLACE 

4168
03:04:04,433 --> 03:04:10,806
WHERE ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.     

4169
03:04:10,806 --> 03:04:14,443
AND CITIZENSHIP IS AN 

4170
03:04:14,443 --> 03:04:15,511
OBLIGATION TO ENSURE IT FOREVER 

4171
03:04:15,511 --> 03:04:18,113
REMAINS THAT WAY.       

4172
03:04:18,113 --> 03:04:24,486
AND MORE THAN ONCE DURING HIS 

4173
03:04:24,486 --> 03:04:25,754
CAREER JOHN DREW COMPARISONS TO 

4174
03:04:25,754 --> 03:04:29,324
TEDDY ROOSEVELT. 

4175
03:04:29,324 --> 03:04:31,627
I'M SURE IT'S BEEN NOTED THAT 

4176
03:04:31,627 --> 03:04:34,863
ROOSEVELT'S MAN IN THE ARENA 

4177
03:04:34,863 --> 03:04:37,699
SEEMS TAILORED TO JOHN. 

4178
03:04:37,699 --> 03:04:41,603
ROOSEVELT SPEAKS OF THOSE WHO 

4179
03:04:41,603 --> 03:04:42,971
STRIVE TO DO GREAT THINGS WHO 

4180
03:04:42,971 --> 03:04:43,539
SOMETIMES WIN AND SOMETIMES 

4181
03:04:43,539 --> 03:04:48,577
COME UP SHORT, BUT ALWAYS 

4182
03:04:48,577 --> 03:04:52,581
RELISH A GOOD FIGHT, A CONTRAST 

4183
03:04:52,581 --> 03:04:55,450
TO THOSE COLD TIMID SOULS WHO 

4184
03:04:55,450 --> 03:04:59,454
KNOW NEITHER VICTORY NOR 

4185
03:04:59,454 --> 03:05:02,658
DEFEAT.     

4186
03:05:02,658 --> 03:05:04,626
ISN'T THAT THE SPIRIT WE 

4187
03:05:04,626 --> 03:05:06,662
CELEBRATE THIS WEEK?     

4188
03:05:06,662 --> 03:05:13,335
THAT'S STRIVING  TO BE BETTER, 

4189
03:05:13,335 --> 03:05:18,239
TO DO BETTER, TO BE WORTHY OF 

4190
03:05:18,239 --> 03:05:27,149
THE GREAT INHERITANCE THAT OUR 

4191
03:05:27,149 --> 03:05:28,584
FOUNDERS BESTOWED? 

4192
03:05:28,584 --> 03:05:31,320
SO MUCH OFOUR POLITICS, PUBLIC 

4193
03:05:31,320 --> 03:05:36,625
LIFE, PUBLIC DISCOURSE CAN SEEM 

4194
03:05:36,625 --> 03:05:42,430
SMALL AND MEAN AND PETTY. 

4195
03:05:42,430 --> 03:05:49,471
TRAFFICKINGAND INSULT AND PHONY 

4196
03:05:49,471 --> 03:05:50,605
CONTROVERSIES AND MANUFACTURED 

4197
03:05:50,605 --> 03:05:54,676
OUTRAGE .  IT'S THE POLITICS

4198
03:05:54,676 --> 03:05:59,681
THAT PRE TENDS TO BE BRAVE AND 

4199
03:05:59,681 --> 03:06:01,016
TOUGH BUT IN FACT, IS BORNE OF 

4200
03:06:01,016 --> 03:06:02,517
FEAR.   

4201
03:06:02,517 --> 03:06:06,154
JOHN CALLED ON US TO BE BIGGER 

4202
03:06:06,154 --> 03:06:06,487
THAN THAT.   

4203
03:06:06,487 --> 03:06:10,559
HE CALLED ON US TO BE BETTER 

4204
03:06:10,559 --> 03:06:13,228
THAN THAT.    

4205
03:06:13,228 --> 03:06:18,300
TODAY IS ONLY ONE DAY IN ALL 

4206
03:06:18,300 --> 03:06:20,702
THE DAYS THERE WILL EVER BE, 

4207
03:06:20,702 --> 03:06:24,573
BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN ALL THE 

4208
03:06:24,573 --> 03:06:27,309
OTHER DAYS THAT WILL EVER COME 

4209
03:06:27,309 --> 03:06:28,577
CAN DEPEND ON WHAT YOU DO 

4210
03:06:28,577 --> 03:06:32,547
TODAY.      

4211
03:06:32,547 --> 03:06:34,916
WHAT BETTER WAY TO HONOR JOHN 

4212
03:06:34,916 --> 03:06:36,918
McCAIN'S LIFE OF SERVICE THAN  

4213
03:06:36,918 --> 03:06:38,987
AS BEST WE CAN.     

4214
03:06:38,987 --> 03:06:43,358
FOLLOW HIS EXAMPLE.      

4215
03:06:43,358 --> 03:06:44,626
TO PROOF THAT THE WILLINGNESS 

4216
03:06:44,626 --> 03:06:47,229
TO GET IN THE ARENA AND FIGHT 

4217
03:06:47,229 --> 03:06:49,331
FOR THIS COUNTRY IS NOT  

4218
03:06:49,331 --> 03:06:50,866
RESERVED FOR THE FEW, IT IS 

4219
03:06:50,866 --> 03:06:54,303
OPENED TO ALL OF US.      

4220
03:06:54,303 --> 03:06:56,738
AND IN FACT, IT'S DEMANDED OF 

4221
03:06:56,738 --> 03:07:03,478
ALL OF US AS CITIZENS OF THIS 

4222
03:07:03,478 --> 03:07:03,845
GREAT REPUBLIC. 

4223
03:07:03,845 --> 03:07:05,647
THAT'S PERHAPS HOW WE HONOR HIM 

4224
03:07:05,647 --> 03:07:08,317
BEST, BY RECOGNIZING THAT THERE 

4225
03:07:08,317 --> 03:07:12,020
ARE SOME THINGS BIGGER THAN 

4226
03:07:12,020 --> 03:07:15,290
PARTY OR AMBITION OR MONEY OR 

4227
03:07:15,290 --> 03:07:16,758
FAME, OUR POWER. 

4228
03:07:16,758 --> 03:07:18,860
BUT THERE'SSOME THINGS THAT ARE 

4229
03:07:18,860 --> 03:07:21,897
WORTH RISKING EVERYTHING FOR.   

4230
03:07:21,897 --> 03:07:27,168
PRINCIPLES THAT ARE ETERNAL, 

4231
03:07:27,168 --> 03:07:31,506
TRUTHS THAT ARE ABIDING. 

4232
03:07:31,506 --> 03:07:32,807
IT IS BEST JOHN SHOWEDUS WHAT 

4233
03:07:32,807 --> 03:07:38,146
THAT MEANS.      

4234
03:07:38,146 --> 03:07:40,482
FOR THAT, WE'RE ALL DEEPLY IN 

4235
03:07:40,482 --> 03:07:45,187
HIS DEBT.    

4236
03:07:45,187 --> 03:07:47,889
MAY GOD BLESS JOHN McCAIN, MAY 

4237
03:07:47,889 --> 03:07:48,423
GOD BLESS THIS COUNTRY HE 

4238
03:07:48,423 --> 03:07:53,128

THAT THEY MAY NOT BE 

4265

IN WASHINGTON THERE WORLD 

4474
03:55:39,224 --> 03:55:41,860
LEADERS, BUT ONE  POINT THAT WE 

4475
03:55:41,860 --> 03:55:42,561
REALLY CAN'T OVERLOOK IS WHO 

4476
03:55:42,561 --> 03:55:44,797
WAS NOT THERE.    

4477
03:55:44,797 --> 03:55:47,933
AND THAT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP 

4478
03:55:47,933 --> 03:55:48,566
THOUGH HE SEEMED TO BE A THEME 

4479
03:55:48,566 --> 03:55:51,937
THROUGHOUT  THIS SERVICE.      

4480
03:55:51,937 --> 03:55:55,340
IN FACT, IT WAS  THE SENATOR'S 

4481
03:55:55,340 --> 03:55:58,344
DAUGHTER WHO GAVE A REALLY  

4482
03:55:58,344 --> 03:56:00,479
POWERFUL EULOGY OF HER FATHER 

4483
03:56:00,479 --> 03:56:01,913
TALKING ABOUT MOURNING THE 

4484
03:56:01,913 --> 03:56:04,082
PASSING OF AMERICAN GREATNESS, 

4485
03:56:04,082 --> 03:56:06,618
THE REAL THING, NOT CHEAP 

4486
03:56:06,618 --> 03:56:12,525
RHETORIC FROM MEN WHO WILL 

4487
03:56:12,525 --> 03:56:13,125

4488
03:56:13,125 --> 03:56:13,626
HE GAVE SO WILLINGLY. 

4489
03:56:13,626 --> 03:56:13,959
IT WASSHARP. 

4490
03:56:13,959 --> 03:56:20,533
>>  YES, IT WAS.

4491
03:56:20,533 --> 03:56:22,501
I CAN NEVER REMEMBER ANYTHING 

4492
03:56:22,501 --> 03:56:24,302
QUITE LIKE WHAT WE SAW TODAY, 

4493
03:56:24,302 --> 03:56:25,303
THE COMING TOGETHER OF ALL 

4494
03:56:25,303 --> 03:56:29,441
THESE PEOPLE.     

4495
03:56:29,441 --> 03:56:31,410
AND IT WAS A FITTING TRIBUTE TO 

4496
03:56:31,410 --> 03:56:31,743
JOHN McCAIN. 

4497
03:56:31,743 --> 03:56:32,678
YOUKNOW WE TALK ABOUT JOHN 

4498
03:56:32,678 --> 03:56:33,478

4499
03:56:33,478 --> 03:56:35,314
TALKER AND ALL THAT.

YES, HE WAS STRAIGHTFORWARD, 

4505
03:56:44,990 --> 03:56:48,427
BUT IN THE END AND I THINK WHAT 

4506
03:56:48,427 --> 03:56:48,994
THIS SERVICE UNDERLINED IS 

4507
03:56:48,994 --> 03:56:52,631
WE'RE GOING TO REMEMBER JOHN 

4508
03:56:52,631 --> 03:56:53,465
McCAIN FOR WHAT HE DID, NOT SO 

4509
03:56:53,465 --> 03:56:58,237
MUCH  THE WORDS THAT HE USED 

4510
03:56:58,237 --> 03:57:00,805
REFUSING EARLY RELEASE FROM 

4511
03:57:00,805 --> 03:57:03,008

CAMPAIGN, FORGIVING HIS CAP 

4514
03:57:08,747 --> 03:57:13,419
TORNADOS IN THE END AND 

4515
03:57:13,419 --> 03:57:14,653
RESTORING RELATION WITH 

4516
03:57:14,653 --> 03:57:14,920
VIETNAM. 

4517
03:57:14,920 --> 03:57:16,788
IN TRUTH JOHN McCAIN LOST MOST 

4518
03:57:16,788 --> 03:57:18,023
OF THE BATTLES HE FOUGHT, BUT 

4519
03:57:18,023 --> 03:57:19,558
WHAT WE HONOR HIM FOR IS THE 

4520
03:57:19,558 --> 03:57:20,893
WAY HE FOUGHT THOSE BATTLES AND 

4521
03:57:20,893 --> 03:57:22,661
THE BATTLES THAT HE CHOOSE TO 

4522
03:57:22,661 --> 03:57:24,029
FIGHT.   

4523
03:57:24,029 --> 03:57:29,401
