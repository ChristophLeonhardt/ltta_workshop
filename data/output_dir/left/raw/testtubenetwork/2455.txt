00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,820
In 2013, TIME magazine selected Pope Francis
as their person of the year and since then,

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,460
he has only become more popular and influential.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,390
According to one study, he is now the most

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,490
influential person on twitter with nearly
17 million followers, and an average of over

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,490
17,000

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,750
retweets per tweet he sends out in multiple
languages.

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,320
The question is - why?

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,320
What has Pope

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,940
Francis done to attain all of this popularity,
and does a more influential pope really matter?

10
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,040
Well, he’s done a lot to bring the Catholic
Church out of the dark ages and as a result,

11
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,040
he’s

12
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,670
pushing humanity as a whole forward in innumerable
ways.

13
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,280
In science, he has accepted the theory of
evolution and the Big Bang.

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,280
In October 2014, he

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,239
said, God is not “a magician with a magic
wand,” and that “the Big Bang, which today

16
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,239
we hold

17
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:44,729
to be the origin of the world, does not contradict
the intervention of the divine creator but

18
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:45,729
rather,

19
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:46,729
requires it.”

20
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:49,699
His stance lessens some of the resistance
to science, that many religious groups

21
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:53,839
have had, making it easier for people to work
in or teach the sciences.

22
00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:56,989
The Pope has also softened the church’s
stance on the LGBT community.

23
00:00:56,989 --> 00:00:58,609
In 2013 he said,

24
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:02,299
“If they accept the Lord and have goodwill,
who am I to judge them?”

25
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:03,299
He also reaffirmed

26
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:07,250
that sentiment in 2014 by encouraging parents
to accept their children no matter their sexual

27
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,250
preference.

28
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,510
This is still a far cry from accepting gay
marriage or allowing open homosexuals

29
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:15,670
into the priesthood, but it does do a lot
to lessen the divide between Catholicism and

30
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,670
the LGBT

31
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,670
community.

32
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,301
Pope Francis has also made the topics of contraception
and abortion less of a priority for the

33
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:25,490
church, insinuating that they should focus
more on fighting poverty instead.

34
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,490
He also wants them

35
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,160
to focus more on protecting the environment,
reforming the global economy and eradicating

36
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,160
sex

37
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,500
crimes and corruption within the church.

38
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,600
This includes eliminating the influence of
the Italian

39
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,610
Mafia.

40
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,660
He also favors more casual daily mass held
in public places.

41
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,660
He lives in a guest home, not

42
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,710
the Apostolic Palace.

43
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,520
He cruises Rome in a normal car - not a bullet-proof
Mercedes limo.

44
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,520
And

45
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,530
when he was elected, instead of blessing the
people, Pope Francis asked the people to bless

46
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,530
him.

47
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,530
Just recently, he also struck a note with
animal lovers when he said “Paradise is

48
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,530
open to all

49
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,530
of God’s creatures.”

50
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,530
This more personal and open approach is part
of how he’s gained so much

51
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,530
popularity.

52
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,460
But fighting for good causes that affect all
of humanity and modernizing the church

53
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,140
itself to be less judgmental and exclusive
is why Pope Francis matters.

54
