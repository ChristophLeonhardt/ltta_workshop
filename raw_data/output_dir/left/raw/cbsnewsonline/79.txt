223
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,880
SUCCESSFUL IN CHALLENGING CASES 

224
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,180

THAT HELPED. 

228
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:01,653
THIS WILL BE OUR LAST SCHEDULED 

229
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:03,756
BRIEFING ON THIS INCIDENT. 

230
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,257
WE MAY RELEASE ADDITIONAL 

231
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:06,492
INFORMATION BUT DON'T HAVE 

232
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,094

WE WILL KEEP YOU POSTED AS

00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,164
THINGS CONTINUE TO DEVELOP. 

235
00:07:12,164 --> 00:07:13,632
NO OTHER SCHEDULED BRIEFINGS AS 

236
00:07:13,632 --> 00:07:13,999
OF THIS TIME. 

237
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:16,034
WITH THAT, WE CAN ANSWER A FEW 

238
00:07:16,034 --> 00:07:16,335
QUESTIONS. 

239
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:17,870
>> WHAT HOTEL DID THE YOUNG MAN 

240
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,136
STAY AT? 

241
00:07:18,136 --> 00:07:19,238
CAN YOU TELL US THAT AND CAN 

242
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:21,441
YOU TELL US IF HE CAME ALONE? 

243
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,174
>> I DON'T HAVE THAT 

244
00:07:22,174 --> 00:07:22,641
INFORMATION WITH ME. 

245
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:27,480
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE WILL 

246
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,981
RELEASE THAT AS OF YET. 

247
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,750
>> HOW DID HE GET THE WEAPONS? 

248
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,120
>> HE PURCHASED FIREARMS IN 

249
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,620
MARYLAND, IN BALTIMORE. 

250
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,823
BASED ON THE INVESTIGATION AT 

251
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:37,956
THIS POINT HE LEGALLY PURCHASED 

252
00:07:37,956 --> 00:07:39,658
THE FIREARMS FROM A LICENSED 

253
00:07:39,658 --> 00:07:43,762
DEALER AND DIDN'T VIOLATE ANY 

254
00:07:43,762 --> 00:07:45,198
LAWS DOING THAT. 

255
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,899
>> DID THE SHOOTER BACK OUT AND 

256
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,735
GET HIS GUNS OR DID HE HAVE 

257
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,203
THEM WITH THEM THE ENTIRE TIME? 

258
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:54,373
>> AT THIS POINT WE WON'T 

259
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:56,241
COMMENT EXACTLY ON THAT BUT 

260
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:58,510
OBVIOUSLY HE HAD BOTH WITH HIM 

261
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,445
WHEN HE COMMITTED THE CRIME. 

262
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:03,982
>> DID HE SAY ANYTHING WHEN HE 

263
00:08:03,982 --> 00:08:05,150
WENT INTO BEGIN FIRING? 

264
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,287
>> NOT THAT WE HAVE HEARD. 

265
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,322
HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. 

266
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,123
>> HE DID BUY THE GUNS 

267
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:13,025
RECENTLY. 

268
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,293
I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT 

269
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:14,593
TIMETABLE. 

270
00:08:14,593 --> 00:08:14,927
TWO WEEKS. 

271
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,629
>> FAIRL RECENTLY WITHIN THE 

272
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:17,730
MONTH OF AUGUST. 

273
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,098
>> WAS IT A 38? 

274
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:19,999
WERE THEY BOTH 38s. 

275
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,834
>> IT WAS NOT A 38. 

276
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:26,806
ONE WAS A 45 CALIBER AND ONE 

277
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:27,673
WAS 9-MILLIMETER. 

278
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,076
>> WAS SOME TYPE OF LASER SITE 

279
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:30,509
USED? 

280
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:31,576
>> WE WON'T COMMENT. 

281
00:08:31,576 --> 00:08:33,145
WE HAVE SEARCHED AND HAVE ITEMS 

282
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,980
TAKEN FROM THE HOTEL ROOM AND 

283
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,246
VEHICLE. 

284
00:08:35,246 --> 00:08:37,116
>> WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT 

285
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:37,383
SECURITY? 

286
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,384
>> WE'LL BE LOOKING AT THAT IN 

287
00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:41,554
THE DAYS AND WEEKS TO COME. 

288
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,722
THE LANDING HAS BEEN VERY 

289
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:44,557
COOPERATIVE WITH THE 

290
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:47,226
INVESTIGATION UP TO THIS POINT. 

291
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:49,562
WE'LL BE ABLE TO DIG INTO THAT. 

292
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:53,933
>> CAN YOU TELL US IF ONE OF 

293
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,467
THE GUNS HAD A LASER SIGHT? 

294
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:58,337
>> ONE DID HAVE AN AFTER MARKET 

295
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,106
LASER SIGHT THAT ATTACHES TO 

296
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:00,439
THE TRIGGER. 

297
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:01,607
>> DO YOU KNOW IF HE CAME TO 

298
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,409
THE CITY WITH SOMEONE ELSE? 

299
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,944
DID HE TRAVEL TO SOMEONE ELSE? 

300
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:07,547
>> I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO 

301
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:07,747
THAT. 

302
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:08,781
>> ANY INFORMATION ON A MOTIVE? 

303
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:11,751
WE HEARD HE MAY HAVE BEEN UPSET 

304
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:12,318
BECAUSE HE WAS ELIMINATED. 

305
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,552
>> THERE IS A LOT OF 

306
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:14,085
CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT. 

307
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:16,355
WE HAVE YET TO HAVE A CONCRETE 

308
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:16,588
MOTIVE. 

309
00:09:16,588 --> 00:09:17,823
IT WILL REVEAL ITSELF IN THE 

310
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,157
CASE. 

311
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:19,759
WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK THAT. 

312
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,827
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT. 

313
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:22,928
WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT WE 

314
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:24,764
CAN STAND HERE AND TELL YOU 

315
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,298
THIS IS THE MOTIVE. 

316
00:09:26,298 --> 00:09:29,635
>> WERE FROM WARNING SIGNS 

317
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:29,868
BEFORE? 

318
00:09:29,868 --> 00:09:30,635
SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS OR ANYTHING 

319
00:09:30,635 --> 00:09:32,771
DISTURBING THAT LED UP TO THIS 

320
00:09:32,771 --> 00:09:33,806
POINT OF THE INVESTIGATION? 

321
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:36,241
>> THIS IS AN ONGOING 

322
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:36,608
INVESTIGATION. 

323
00:09:36,608 --> 00:09:38,411
WE ARE EXPLORING LEADS, ALL 

324
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,312
SOCIAL MEDIA, AND EVERYTHING WE 

325
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:39,512
CAN. 

326
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,447
WE WILL NOT COMMENT AT THIS 

327
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:41,680
POINT. 

328
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,214
WE ARE LOOKING INTO IT. 

329
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:44,916
IF THE PUBLIC HAS ANY 

330
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,118
INFORMATION ABOUT THE SUBJECT, 

331
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:47,353
HAD ANY INTERACTION PRIOR, WE 

332
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:50,289
WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THEM PASS ON 

333
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:51,557
THAT INFORMATION TO THE 

334
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:52,024
SHERIFFS DEPARTMENT. 

335
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,759
>> WOULD HE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 

336
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,893
BUY THOSE GUNS IN FLORIDA WITH 

337
00:09:54,893 --> 00:09:57,496
THE CURRENT LAWS THAT WE HAVE 

338
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:58,664
NOW, THE RED FLAG LAWS? 

339
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:01,867
>> AGAIN, UNTIL WE GET MORE 

340
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:02,534
DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT HIS 

341
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:03,669
BACKGROUND THE SHORT ANSWER IS 

342
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:03,869
YES. 

343
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:04,870
>> DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE 

344
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,806
WERE IN THE BUILDING WHEN THE 

345
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:07,239
SHOOTING HAPPENED? 

346
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,974
>> I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER. 

347
00:10:08,974 --> 00:10:12,078
WE KNOW HOW MANY BUT I DON'T 

348
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,646
HAVE THE NUMBER WITH ME. 

349
00:10:14,646 --> 00:10:15,147
>> APPROXIMATELY? 

350
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,448
>> 150, 130, SOMEWHERE IN THAT 

351
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:16,715
BALLPARK. 

352
00:10:16,715 --> 00:10:21,820
>> DID YOU KNOW ANY OF THE 

353
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,087
VICTIMS. 

354
00:10:22,087 --> 00:10:23,689
WERE THERE PRIOR RELATIONSHIPS? 

355
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:24,457
>> THERE ARE PRIOR 

356
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,758
RELATIONSHIPS. 

357
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,092
I DON'T KNOW SPECIFICALLY ABOUT 

358
00:10:27,092 --> 00:10:27,459
WHICH VICTIMS. 

359
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:28,727
THIS GROUP TRAVELS AS A CIRCUIT 

360
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:31,297
SO THEY ARE FAMILIAR WITH EACH 

361
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,298
OTHER. 

362
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,599
>> WERE THERE ANY NOTES LEFT? 

363
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,032
>> NO NOTES. 

364
00:10:34,032 --> 00:10:35,501
>> WAS THERE AN INDICATION THAT 

365
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,536
THIS WAS SOMETHING HE PLANNED 

366
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:38,236
PRIOR TO COMING TO 

367
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:38,570
JACKSONVILLE? 

368
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:41,640
>> NO INDICATION THAT IT WAS 

369
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,441
SOMETHING HE PLANNED PRIOR TO 

370
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:43,976
SUNDAY. 

371
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,043
>> ONE MORE QUESTION. 

372
00:10:45,043 --> 00:10:48,346
>> THE HOSPITAL SAID THEY 

373
