1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
eventually I realized that's who he is

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,560
the inner guide there is no inner guy

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,679
I did interview him a number of times I

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,299
went to his office a number of times and

5
00:00:12,299 --> 00:00:14,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">then I saw him on other occasions around</font>

6
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:17,099
the country so I saw him a lot certainly

7
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:18,330
when I came<font color="#E5E5E5"> to his office I'd have a</font>

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,369
long list of questions I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a proper</font>

9
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:23,490
biographer your childhood influences you

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,809
know all the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that biographers</font>

11
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:27,329
want to pursue I never could get an

12
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:30,180
answer really<font color="#E5E5E5"> on anything or if I did it</font>

13
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,460
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a monosyllabic what was the</font>

14
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,649
influence of military school you'd say

15
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,320
something like I got a good education

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,440
period just<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was no I couldn't get</font>

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,449
any nuance I couldn't get beneath the

18
00:00:42,449 --> 00:00:44,249
surface around it was that was all I

19
00:00:44,249 --> 00:00:46,079
would get and then he would<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,300
ramble and then he would talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

21
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,670
of his accomplishments and it was it was

22
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,569
very hard to really dig into anything

23
00:00:54,569 --> 00:00:57,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">donnell had no rearview mirror he was</font>

24
00:00:57,269 --> 00:01:00,269
just looking ahead you know the past who

25
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:03,960
cares and he<font color="#CCCCCC"> just wasn't interested in</font>

26
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,570
pursuing that at all and at the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

27
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,670
thought like oh if I just asked it a

28
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,620
different way<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe there's a different</font>

29
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,560
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put this question and then I</font>

30
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,350
could like get to the inner guy

31
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,270
eventually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I realized that's who he is</font>

32
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,090
the inner guy there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no inner guy he's</font>

33
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">not an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> insightful you know introspective</font>

34
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">guy I mean we've all seen this but in</font>

35
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:29,729
private he's the same way as we see him

36
00:01:29,729 --> 00:00:00,000
in public
