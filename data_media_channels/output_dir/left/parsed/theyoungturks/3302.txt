>>MICHAEL FLYNN IS APPARENTLY
ONCE AGAIN A TARGET IN THE
MUELLER INVESTIGATION, IN THIS
CASE IN REGARDS TO SOMETHING
PARTICULARLY SALACIOUS, AN
ALLEGED PLOT TO KIDNAP A MUSLIM
CLERIC LIVING IN THE U.S. TO
DELIVER HIM TO HIS POLITICAL
OPPONENTS IN TURKEY --
>>HE SAYS ALTHOUGH HE WASN'T
THERE FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE
CONVERSATION, THEY WERE TALKING
ABOUT POSSIBLY OUTSIDE THE LEGAL
U.S. EXTRADITION SYSTEM, AND
THERE WAS TALK OF USING A
PRIVATE JET TO TAKE HIM TO A
TURKISH PRISON ISLAND, ALSO THE
BASE OF A SUPER VILLAIN.
>>IN A SENSE.
THINK ABOUT HOW
CRAZY THIS IS UNDER BOTH
SCENARIOS.
THE TURKISH
GOVERNMENT OFFERED TO GIVE THE
FLYNN BOYS 15 MILLION BUCKS --
THIS IS IN DECEMBER DURING THE
TRANSITION, THEY KNOW TRUMP IS
GOING TO BE PRESIDENT AND FLYNN
IS WORKING FOR TRUMP, AND HE
EVENTUALLY BECAME NATIONAL
SECURITY ADVISOR -- EITHER WHEN
YOU GET IN OFFICE ENSURE YOU
EXTRADITE HIM, RIGHT OR WRONG IT
DOESN'T MATTER, I'M GIVING YOU
$15 MILLION TO DO IT, THAT WOULD
BE FLAT OUT BRIBERY FROM A
FOREIGN GOVERNMENT.
AND BY THE
WAY ALSO DISMISSED CHARGES
AGAINST A GUY WHO MIGHT PROVE
THAT SOME VERY IMPORTANT PEOPLE
IN THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT STOLE
MONEY.
GET RID OF HIM, DISMISSED
CHARGES, LET HIM GO SO PEOPLE
NEVER FIND OUT ABOUT OUR
CORRUPTION.
IT ALMOST CAN'T GET
WORSE UNTIL YOU REALIZE THE
SECOND SCENARIO, IF THAT DOESN'T
WORK IT'S GO TIME, PUT ON THE
PANTYHOSE THING ON YOUR FACE,
GET IN THE VAN, AND LITERALLY
KIDNAP THE GUY FROM THE MIDDLE
OF PENNSYLVANIA AND DELIVER HIM
TO OUR SECRET, EVIL ISLAND.
THAT
IS INSANE.
AND THE FLYNN GUYS
ARE LIKE, THAT MAKES SENSE.
WOOLSEY IS LIKE, I HAVE TO GET
OUT OF HERE!
WOOLSEY IS A NEOCON
THROUGH AND THROUGH, HE'S
MASSIVELY, CRAZY RIGHT WING, AND
HE'S LIKE, WHAT DID THEY JUST
SAY?
I LITERALLY HAVE TO LEAVE
THE BUILDING RIGHT NOW.
>>THAT'S THE DOWNSIDE.
THE
UPSIDE IS IF YOU ARE GOING TO
HAVE A NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
SURE YOU COULD HAVE SOME STUFFY
IVORY TOWER ACADEMIC, OR YOU
COULD HAVE A POTENTIAL
INTERNATIONAL BOUNTY HUNTER.
ISN'T THAT BAD ASS AS YOUR
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR?
IS
LIKE A DOG THE BOUNTY HUNTER IS
ADVISING THE PRESIDENT.
>>IT SOUNDS BAD ASS BUT I ASSURE
IT IS NOT, A $15 MILLION BRIBE
IS NOTHING TO SNEEZE AT.
I THINK THE FLYNNS ARE IN
MASSIVE TROUBLE.
>>WE HAVE TO READ THEIR
RESPONSE, A STATEMENT BY COUNSEL
TO LIEUTENANT GENERAL MICHAEL T
FLYNN, OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE
PROCESS OF THE 26 TEAM CAMPAIGN
WE'VE INTENTIONALLY AVOIDED
RESPONDING TO EVERY RUMOR OR
ALLEGATION IN THE MEDIA BUT
TODAY'S NEWS CYCLE HAS BROUGHT
ALLEGATIONS RANGING FROM
KIDNAPPING TO BRIBERY THAT ARE
SO OUTRAGEOUS AND PREJUDICIAL
THAT WE ARE MAKING AN EXCEPTION
TO OUR USUAL RULE.
THEY ARE
FALSE.
>>HERE IS MY TAKE, I'VE SAID
THIS, I THINK IT'S HARD TO --
WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO HERE
WITH THIS MUELLER INVESTIGATION
IS TRYING TO PIECE WHAT'S BEING
LEAKED TO THE MEDIA, WE DON'T
KNOW EVERYTHING, BUT HERE'S WHAT
WE DO KNOW.
WE KNOW THERE'S A
MANAFORT INDICTMENT, HIS BODY
HAS BEEN INDICTED, THERE'S A
GUILTY PLEA FROM PAPADOPOULOS,
WHO WAS WEARING A WIRE FOR SOME
PERIOD OF TIME WITH TRUMP
ASSOCIATES.
WE KNOW FLYNN HAS
BEEN TALKING TO MUELLER FOR SOME
TIME AND FLYNN IS TRYING TO
PROTECT HIS SON, AS ANY FATHER
WOULD.
AND WE KNOW THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION CAN NO LONGER SAY
THIS IS FAKE NEWS AND BOGUS
BECAUSE THIS INVESTIGATION IS
MOVING CLOSER TO HIS INNER
CIRCLE.
THEY MET WITH STEPHEN
MILLER THIS WEEK, WITH HOPE
HICKS LAST WEEK, THEY ASKED
KUSHNER TO TURN OVER PAPERWORK,
AND THE OTHER THING THEY LOVE TO
SAY WITH THIS INVESTIGATION --
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER WHO IS NOT
TALKING.
YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHO
THE REPUBLICAN LOUDMOUTHS ARE
AND WHY THEY ARE EERILY QUIET.
AND THE ONE I LIKE TO REMIND
PEOPLE ABOUT, THE LOUDEST MOUTH
OF THEM ALL WHO IS SO QUIET THAT
IT'S SHOCKING, RUDY GIULIANI.
HE
HAS NOTHING TO SAY.
WHY?
BECAUSE
I THINK HE'S SINGING TO MUELLER
LIKE A CANARY AT CHRISTMAS.
>>THAT IS INTERESTING
SPECULATION.
>>WHY ELSE WOULD RUDY GIULIANI
BE QUIET?
HE'S SINGING, HE'S
SAYING THIS IS WHAT'S GOING ON,
I'M NOT TRYING TO GO TO JAIL --
>>I HAVE NOT HEARD THIS
PREDICTION BUT IF IT TURNS OUT
TO BE TRUE YOU GET CREDIT.
>>THE OTHER PERSON WHO IS QUIET
IS KUSHNER'S SISTER WHO WAS
PUSHING THE VISAS TO FOREIGN
ENTITIES, NOW SHE'S GONE QUIET.
>>I LOVE PRODUCTIONS, JOHN IS
RIGHT, IF GIULIANI IS
TALKING I WILL GIVE YOU ALL THE
CREDIT IN THE WORLD.
>>THE ONLY PERSON NOT GOING TO
JAIL, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU
THIS, THE ONE PERSON THAT WILL
NOT GO TO JAIL BECAUSE SHE'S A
SURVIVOR, OMAROSA.
SHE WILL BE
SITTING IN THE WHITE HOUSE LIKE,
I DON'T GO TO JAIL, I'M A
SURVIVOR BOO.
>>SHE WILL BE THE LAST ONE
VOTED OFF THE ISLAND.
THE WALLS
ARE CLOSING IN EVEN MORE ON
DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE NOW DONALD
TRUMP, JR., SOME ARE SAYING, IS
BEING INVESTIGATED FOR
CONSPIRACY TO VIOLATE THE
FEDERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN ACT
BECAUSE OF THE MEETING HE HAD
WITH RUSSIAN LAWYERS.
THERE WAS
AN INTERVIEW DONE WITH THE
RUSSIAN LAWYER RECENTLY WHERE
SHE SAID YES, HE PROMISED THAT
IF DONALD TRUMP WINS THEY WOULD
GET RID OF THE LAW THAT WAS
BLOCKING THE FUNDS OF THE
RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS.
WE PUT A
FREEZE ON THEIR ACCOUNTS, AND
ACCORDING TO THE RUSSIAN LAWYER
WHO MET WITH DONALD TRUMP, JR.
AND KUSHNER AND MANAFORT, TRUMP,
JR.
SAID IF WE WIN WE WILL DO
THAT FAVOR FOR YOU IF YOU GIVE
US THE STOLEN EMAILS OF HILLARY
CLINTON.
WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY
GOT THE EMAILS BUT FIVE DAYS
AFTER THAT MEETING IS WHEN THERE
WERE LEAKED DOCUMENTS FROM THE
CLINTON CAMPAIGN AND ONE WEEK
LATER WIKILEAKS PUBLISHED HACKED
DNC EMAILS.
WE DON'T KNOW IF
THAT'S CONNECTED, IT'S CURIOUS
TIMING, THIS MEETING THAT DONALD
TRUMP, JR., AND DONALD TRUMP --
BECAUSE HE'S THE ONE THAT WROTE
THE MEMO DENYING ALL THIS FOR
JUNIOR, WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE
THEY BASICALLY ADMITTED THAT ON
AIR FORCE ONE, DONALD TRUMP
WROTE THE LIE --
>>TOOK PERSONAL CONTROL OF IT.
>>SAID IT WAS JUST A MEETING
ABOUT ADOPTION, WHICH WASN'T
TRUE.
IF IN FACT THEY EVEN ASKED
FOR THE STOLEN EMAILS AND
PROMISED IN RETURN THAT THEY
WOULD GET RID OF THAT LAW, THAT
WOULD ALREADY BE A VIOLATION OF
THE FEDERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN
ACT, AND A CONSPIRACY TO VIOLATE
IT.
SO TRUMP, JR. IS IN TROUBLE,
DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF IS TOUCHED
BY THAT, LET ALONE IF ANYONE
FLIPS ON HIM. AND WITH THE
FLYNNS BEING IN THIS MUCH
TROUBLE, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
DECADES IN PRISON IF YOU WERE
GOING TO GET BRIBED BY A FOREIGN
GOVERNMENT AND YOU OFFERED TO DO
THESE ACTS FOR THEM, THAT'S AS
SERIOUS A CRIME AS YOU CAN HAVE
ON THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE, IF
THEY FLIP AND THEY KNOW
SOMETHING ABOUT TRUMP AND THE
CONNECTION TO THE RUSSIANS THEN
HE'S TOAST AND HE'S GONE.
BUT WE
DON'T KNOW YET IF THE FLYNNS
KNOW ABOUT THE CONNECTIONS TRUMP
HAS WITH RUSSIA AND WHEN THOSE
CONNECTIONS ARE, BUT NOW THE
WALLS ARE CLOSING IN.
