stepping into history kim jeong-hoon becomes the first North Korean leader to set foot in the South since the Korean War could this small step be the giant breakthrough that brings an end to decades of hostility this is inside story hello there and welcome to the program I'm Laura Kyle it was just one small gesture one small step forward but the significance of the move by North Korea's leader Kim jong-un is certainly historic and will be remembered for years to come Kim became the first North Korean leader to visit South Korea since the end of the war between the two countries in 1953 he was warmly welcomed and embraced by South Korea's president moon jae-in after decades of military standoff between the two sides their leaders made a declaration of peace and promised a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula we'll get to our guests in just a moment but first our diplomatic hosted James BAE's reports from Pat drew in South Korea technically they are still at war but this was carefully choreographed to create a new atmosphere of peace North Korean leader Kim jong-un entered from the north side of the demarcation line the South Korean president moon jae-in waited at the concrete block that marks the start of his country's territory a historic handshake and then something in all the years since the Korean War that Kim's father and grandfather never did a North Korean leader crossing into South Korea it was followed by a reciprocal gesture moon jae-in very briefly crossing the line into the north both leaders seemed relaxed and were smiling but of course they hope this summit is only the start of a process and that's likely to be complicated and will involve difficult negotiations the Dames this meeting i hope that there is new history written with regards to peaceful prosperity and i will approach this with a feeling of a brand new start I'd like to discuss all issues that standing honestly and frankly I would like to take this opportunity to say that I hope to have a very good conversation with president moon today honest Frank and with intention when the supreme leader crossed the demarcation line on this historic moment there is immense expectation on us all over the world and I hope this discussion is productive let's approach this discussion boldly and wishing for peace and I like to give something very big to the people looking at us we have all day to talk and let's do so and make up for the 10 years that we have that past over lunch the North Korean leader and his fast-moving security detail headed back to the north side so he could confer with other members of his delegation then a few hours later a symbolic moment a tree planting using earth from mountains in the north and the south and water from the two biggest rivers on both sides another image filled with symbolism as the two crossed a footbridge together then in a move highly unusual in international diplomacy they stopped the two leaders sitting face-to-face alone with not even note takers for over half an hour ironing out the final issues of their declaration it was signed and they made these statements Chucky mundo John it's very significant that North Korea took a measure of freezing its nuclear activities first it will be a valuable beginning for the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula Kim jong-un and I declare that there will be no more war on the Korean Peninsula and a new age of peace has begun oh yeah II mean gee you know I feel that we are part of one family and both countries will have a new policy of cooperation after years of disputes we are here today to say that nothing will make us different again and I will say this but North Koreans and the South Koreans are now sharing one spot on the map and they represent one country in one way or another and we hope to achieve the ambitions and hopes of both countries the fact that this summit took place in itself is historic but if some of the things in this declaration actually happened they too will be landmark developments a formal end to the Korean War a peace treaty between North Korea and South Korea and a return visit by president moon to Pyongyang in the fall one part of the agreement though will face particular scrutiny and that's the pledge of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula the language used in the declaration gives no concrete details and no timeline the wives of the Korean leaders joined the delegations for a formal banquet to end a long day of diplomacy but this is only the start of a lengthy and very difficult process James BAE's al Jazeera pazu in South Korea let's bring in our guests now and in Exeter we have the UK we have Aiden Foster Carter honoree senior research fellow in sociology and modern career at Leeds University in Beijing Tong Xiao fellow at the nuclear policy program at Carnegie - noir center for global policy and in Seoul Jasper King director for conflict management at Ohio University in South Korea a warm welcome to all of you just but let's start with you there's a big day huge day there for North and South Korea where you are what was the standout moment for you well I think the standout moment occurred right in the very beginning I mean if there was a bullet that started World War 1 in Europe then maybe a handshake could bring about peace in the Korean Peninsula in Northeast Asia and what we're looking for in this agreement is momentum positive momentum and they don't want anything derailed for the next round of talks where Kim jong-un beats Donald Trump so what they want is cautious a cautious approach and I think we have an agreement that's very broad-based has lots of oratory language such that every party every leader can look at that and extrapolate from it what they want and bring it back to their constituents and claim a win okay well look a little bit more about the at the joint declaration in a moment first of all Aidan just want to focus on the actual day itself because it was a huge day of symbolism was knowing every step meant something and there seem to be sort of a genuine warmth between these two men what did you make of the rapport that you saw there I was encouraged by that I mean I've been watching this for so long and I've been disappointed before that I was trying to sort of stop myself getting carried away but we do live as we didn't probably be in the last two summits which anyway were in Pyongyang where media access is not quite what it is in in South Korea but I thought I thought there was a lot of warmth and know people weren't remember the visuals and there were all kinds of things like moon jae-in president moon briefly stepping in to the north I think that was an unscripted rather clever move by by it by Kim jong-un and as you say and sitting in that rather beautiful sort of bucolic rural environment and yet of course it's pan man Jon we're only a few months ago a North Korean escaped in a hail of bullets so it seen so many calm it's so all of the symbolism and that you know similar symbolism is real it's another kind of fact it's not the same as substantive peace but I think it was a very good start yes yes heard that bridge that we saw the two leaders sitting on for half an hour of course the big question everyone wants to know is what were they talking about then those speculation must be rife they're in Seoul what are people suggesting yeah I mean it would have been great to be a Wallflower and just just trying to listen in and what we know is that it was most of it was just kind of improvised I mean they were scheduled to meet and talk but definitely not for that long and while we don't know exactly verbally what they were talking about we know from their nonverbals their nonverbal communication that what they're doing is signalling cooperation with each other and although they probably get into the details exactly what they won't want is to create a spirit for which an agreement written and verbal can wrap around the spirit of the trust something that's been missing in the Korean Peninsula arguably for decades so I think when they're talking when you see that they're relaxed they're smiling but also serious it sends a very very powerful message to the world but most importantly to each other that they're willing to cooperate and is that the message Tong gel that's being read from this in China well I think China saw a very positive and encouraging message from this meeting the two leaders really showed a great deal of willingness to great significantly improving their political relations in fact when kim jonghwan was walking together with moon jae-in in front of the the honor guard and wenjian said you know this this was a scaled-down version of the honor guard and you could see the full version if you come to the blue house think conjoining immediately responded I would love to go to blue house whenever you invite me so that really shows North Korea wants to continue this high-level engagement with South Korea continue to open up to not only village South Korea but also potentially to village other trees in this region i think kim jong-in has shown a willingness to gradually transform North Korea into a normal member of international community and also another interesting moment during the summer meeting with it was when Kim Jong hoon was talking about inviting the South Korean president moon jae-in to North Korea he joked that he would be embarrassed because of the poor road conditions in North Korea and I think that's another signal that North Korea was to focus on economic development from now on and would welcome international investment and other cooperation in in trade and economic development I think that's important signal that we the international community should seize upon this opportunity to encourage North Korea to further liberalize and further open up I think China would feel very encouraged by that signal okay Aidan do you do you agree with that is this an opportunity here is there a chance to seize that are we seeing Kim Jong and wanting to transform North Korea to open up would you would you go that far I wouldn't go quite that far and this is where you do have to look at precedent and well into other things such as the small fact of UN sanctions one of the things we're going to have to weigh very carefully and look at carefully in me in the weeks and months ahead is first of all how far all the very concrete things on Lee specifically inter-korean stuff the non-nuclear stuff you might say there it does include some security it measures if that all gets implemented but then you know there's talk of economic measures Kim jong-un it's true has always said that he wants economic development but so far it's always been part of what was called dongjin which roughly means in tandem and the other thing that he also wants to have his nuclear weapons he cannot do that there are UN sanctions which prevent all manner of investment such as there was in the previous sunshine era people may remember when they weren't so many sanctions or sometimes none at all so it's actually we can't take this on trust there's nothing in the nuclear issue in the statement other than generalities when it comes to the summit with Trump we're going to have to fill that box as concretely as the the north-south box I'm saying here was very filled with some very concrete things in the inter-korean summit we've got to have that you know maybe want to go into that running ahead but you know verification declaration in inventories all sorts of stuff without which I don't think we can go forward unfortunately on all the other stuff yeah no it's okay let's let's let's run with that for a bit just for Kim what do we need to see we've got this commitment to denuclearize the peninsula how sincere do you think Kim is to that commitment what do we need to see happen well in terms of optics I think we can get the sense that he is sincere or at least trying to look sincere and that's the first step because before that wasn't really the case before today and in terms of moving forward I really see this in terms of three stages phase one is the emotional part and that's really what the pomp and ceremony for today's digital optics is about this was a highly calibrated bunch of choreography that occurred quite successfully and second the second phase would be dealing with economics and there is a lot of back and forth about whether economics assistance will be given or not but what we do know is that that's what North Korea wants but for it to receive something it must give something it's a quid pro quo it's a very basics of negotiation so we'll have to see that come to play in the next iteration when Kim Jona meets Donald Trump and the third and last phase is dealing with security and it's a very complex issue of course and it's been something that's been very elusive so normally in a complex negotiation multistage negotiation like this you would be held off to the backstage but it's unclear because the parties want it at different times of the negotiation but these three phases I think are highly interlinked okay and we do have this mention of high-level military talks next month that's pretty significant isn't it and one wonders what will be topping the the generals agendas there at those talks yes I mean the military component is always there in the Korean Peninsula it was there today because the ROK and the u.s. joint military drills were suspended specifically for this and that in itself is a big big statement that the u.s. is willing to stop and wait for this peace process to maybe come to fruition at least in the early stages and of course afterwards the joint drills won't occur with that what will be the issue of the number of US troops UN troops in the Korean Peninsula all these things have to be ironed out but of course you know you rome wasn't created in a day and peace can't be created in the Korean Peninsula in a day also I think we have to be fairly patient we have to be optimistic and guarded at the same time because as Ayden mentioned the declaration today has some echos of the declaration of 2007 so we can't be fully trusting but as may be Reagan said trust but verify okay and if we just look at what North Korea's nuclear capability is at this point because it has been suggested that Kim is willing to look optimistic to be optimum forward with denuclearization because he already has a nuclear weapon do you think that might be the case actually I do and I think that before we get very very far down the nuclear road and we've really hardly started on it this time we're going to the pessimist is speaking now denuclearization of the whole Peninsula is the phrase the North Koreans use so there must be quid pro quo from the South in the past they the north are said it wants US troops out we've heard others that South Korea sort of which of course wants to put a big spin on all of this stuff even before the summit saying that actually no they're backed away from that well we need to see what the quid pro quo is that's demanded and of course the global position is very different that North Korea is the only state that's ever joined the non-proliferation treaty and then left it it's got endless many new UN resolutions against it unanimous many sections and so other words they're in violation and they've got to stop unconditionally and the North isn't going to do that I think it's only because they've the all the stuff of the last year that I think Kim Dragon is now confident that he will not have the fate of Iraq or Libya or you because he's got this thing and that that's not the same as giving up this thing so there's going to be some real difficulty when we get further down the nuclear Road Tom Dowd do you echo those those concerns we how likely is it for example but down the road perhaps not too far Kim jong-un is going to allow weapons and SPECT nuclear weapons inspectors in is that on his radar at all well in theory down the road if North Korea would improve its relations with all other major powers in the region if North Korea's security environment fundamentally improved North Korea for sure will not rely so much on nuclear weapons for its security but that really requires a fundamental change of relationship between North Korea and South Korea and also between North Korea United States basically North Korea requires US and South Korea to provide sufficient security guarantee in order for North to consider denuclearization however as we all know squarely guarantee is bad definition reversible it's basically a political commitment to not threaten the other side but this commitment can be withdrawn any time so it is very difficult for North Korea to trust this curry guarantee and therefore with we all saw North Korea no longer demanding the u.s. and South Korea to provide such security guarantee it no longer requires the u.s. to withdraw its troops from South Korea I think that's a signal that North Korea also no longer think about completely gave up its nuclear weapons so for the foreseeable future I think North Korea would likely continue to keep some nuclear capabilities in the meantime it might agree to make some concessions for example the north korean leader kim jong-in has already made explicit high-level political commitment to the ultimate goal of denuclearization and in addition to that North Korea seems waiting to take anchora measures in the direction of freezing its nuclear capabilities I think those are encouraging steps that would start a process of direct engagement and in the long run the engagement might help build some trust and enough trust might make North Korea willing to take more radical steps in the future towards rolling back is capabilities okay and what support or or did leverage can China employee here of course it toughened up those economic sanctions against North Korea some say that might have been responsible for bringing Kim to the table in the first place there have since been reports just reports of the state that China has been loosening some of those sanctions again and trade has resumed across the border so what's China's stance right now oh I disagree with the premise that it is economic sanctions that forced the North Korea to change its policy in recent months I think the primary driving force behind North Korea's charm offensive was the simple fact that North Korea has already acquired a basic but credible nuclear strategic deterrent by the end of 2017 and after achieving that North Korea was able to offer some self-restraint its hope is to keep its nuclear weapons and to build a normal relationship with other countries on that basis and another important factor here is the strategic rivalry the strategic competition between the two major powers China and United States is also growing in recent months the United States has clearly defined China as this most important long-term strategic competitor as a result China grows increasingly worried that North Korea might develop a closer relationship with the United States down with China so now we are seeing China United States actually in a competition to court North Korea to develop good relations with North Korea against that by just running out of time are you shaking your head there's just a few if you want to respond to that and then I go back to Jasper I don't think China needs to worry too much on that score I mean you occasionally get these things said but I mean the idea of any sort of close relationship as opposed to a pragmatic let's solve the the nuclear issue I think between the u.s. and North Korea given that the whole history between them I think is fanciful I mean in the u.s. even before sanctions had its own trading with the enemy sanction doesn't trade with China is the neighbour China has the historical associations 90% for North Korea's trade even now is with China if China is really where I can see Chuck I'm sure it's a bit mobile worried that South Korea will compete for influence in Pyongyang but the u.s. I I must have if I don't see that okay Jasper we are just coming to the end I want to look ahead a little to this summit between Trump and Kim what more do you think the White House wants to see from a summit than what was achieved today and a bit of a two-fold question I'm afraid it is there any concern that the u.s. objectives might derail the progress that's already been made well I'll take the second question first I think there might be slight concerned because the pronouncement today of the declaration was emphatic and it was very very noteworthy and it takes a little bit of the spotlight away from Donald Trump and if we know one thing about Donald Trump is that you'd like to spotlight and but on the other hand that there is forward momentum a lot of momentum of wind behind the back of this conversation about peace in the Korean Peninsula from which Donald Trump can leverage and basically what the US and the dong Trump would like to do in my view is take this process to the finish line not that to basically get two ICBMs to zero on that time in late May or early June but to create a concrete detailed framework and process to get there and where he can claim a win and Kim jong-un can claim a win and the South Korean president when Jane can claim a win along with the other parties find out the Russia etc so that is something that everyone wants and we're actually quite in the process towards getting there of course there's a lot of challenges curves in the road but we're definitely on that path okay Aidan ten seconds are you hopeful for the future on the peninsula yes yes I am on the peninsula front I'm just slightly worried that good relations on the peninsula which is wonderful and so on everyone will think oh well let's let them keep the nukes and that really wouldn't be a good idea no okay fascinating stuff many thanks to all of you for joining us Aidan foster Carter Tong Jo and Jasper Kim and thank you too very much for watching you can see the program again anytime spy visiting our website this aljazeera.com and for further discussion do go to our Facebook page that's facebook.com slash AJ Inside Story you can also join the conversation on twitter our handle is at aj inside story from me laura Kyle and the whole team here bye for now
