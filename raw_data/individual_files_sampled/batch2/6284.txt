Donald Trump recently addressed sanctuary cities and states like California that he feels aren't strict enough when it comes to deporting undocumented immigrants and he just kind of threw up his hands recently and said you know what maybe I need to stop helping states like California let me give you his exact quote it's hilarious frankly if I wanted to pull our people from California you would have a crime nest like you've never seen in California and when he says pull our people he means immigration officials all I'd have to do is say ice and Border Patrol let California alone you'd be inundated you would see crime like nobody has ever seen crime in this country that I find surprising is that he used the word inundated sounds like a parent talking to his child if you like ice if you like my immigration policy but I'm gonna pull those ice officials out of your state how that works out for you good do it you don't like the broccoli at all oh my god okay so he had continued if we ever pulled our ice out and we ever said hey let California alone let them figure it out for themselves in two months they'd be begging for us to come back they would be begging and you know what I'm thinking about doing it yeah he's such a child and look the reality is and he keeps perpetuating the stereotype about undocumented immigrants he thinks they're all members of ms-13 of course that's not the case there have been studies that focus specifically on immigrant communities undocumented immigrant communities and what those studies find is that crime actually tends to be a little lower in those communities because they're so terrified of being deported and by the way they're just not violent people they like to cherry-pick you know specific cases and then generalize about entire populations based on that alone so he's not gonna pull ice and by the way again for the billionth time what our sanctuary cities sanctuary cities are not cities where elected officials or law enforcement tell people hey you're undocumented awesome live over here they just they want federal agencies like ice to a first of all you need to provide resources to these municipalities or to these states if you want them to detain people on your behalf and they also want evidence of wrongdoing they want evidence that these people actually broke a crime if they're gonna use their resources their local resources to detain these people and there was this problem where ice officials would pressure local law enforcement to detain people indefinitely and that costs money right and so sanctuary city again is not oh we're letting everyone in and we're not doing anything about it and there's one other really important point maybe the most important point and a police chief in LA talked about and had the best quote in this story the point is if you what the federal government now wants you to do is if you're in Los Angeles San Francisco etc somebody comes in and says oh there was a robbery in my neighborhood they say give me your papers to the victim and and if the victim doesn't have their papers okay you're undocumented I'm turning over the federal government well if you do that they won't report crimes anymore so Police Chief Charlie Beck in LA said we've made our biggest impact by arresting and incarcerating individuals who engage in violent crime and not the general deportation of the residents they victimize it's such a great point and that's a cop that's the LA Police Department Chief and by the way they've done a pretty good job of bringing down crime specifically from ms-13 here in LA and there's been studies that show sanctuary cities have less crime than non sanctuary cities why because they actually let you report the crime without deporting you now the one thing that I'm just really getting tired of is that the face of immigration is always brown and it's not we every time they talk about immigrants they are specifically talking about Latinos Mexicans that are coming from across the border when people migrate here from all over the world and you people who keep talking this shit if you're a great great great great grandparents migrated here from somewhere else but all immigrants are not from Mexico or Latin America and it just it gets really sickening as a brown person to here every time here the immigration thing you talk about political people were walking by me chanting build that wall to me and I'm Puerto Rican built the wine the ocean we're gonna build it seals let go dolphins like it's so annoying to have to here every time you talk about immigration and I'm in a room with people look at me all people that come here who are illegal immigrants are not from Latin America and that's that gets really old so I know that border here's an island cuz Donald Trump told me Porto Rico is an island where the rest was already knew that he's like it's surrounded by water big water ocean water that's quote real everybody knows that an island is surrounded by water big water anyway so that it would make it awfully difficult to to build a wall but what one more point could you imagine if a Democratic president said about a red state yeah maybe I won't take care of Alabama anymore if Obama was like Alabama Mississippi I'm gonna pull out federal resources from there a good luck you red state people I don't care about you oh my god heads would have exploded he hates real Americans can you believe what he's saying he's supposed to represent all of us you know there's such special little snowflakes these Republicans whenever like you say anything amount of red state or cuz Arizona how could you say that you've offended us how could you say as Obama did you know they're clinging to guns and the Bible etc well okay if you clink the guns in the Bible I don't even know what's wrong with that right like you to fire to do the most animated I've seen imagine if we walked around saying you gotta get rid of those Eastern European immigrants they keep coming here with that human trafficking you know what I mean like you know yeah we watch so many stereotypes absolutely you want to talk about crime all the time but it says they are snowflakes and it gets old it gets really old yo yeah and one last thing you talked about everybody's in immigrant and so the point I like to make is their original immigrants to this country the Puritans and the others we're all undocumented yep I can I see your ancestors papers all right they never had any so I believe that's a little bit of hypocrisy on your part you just
