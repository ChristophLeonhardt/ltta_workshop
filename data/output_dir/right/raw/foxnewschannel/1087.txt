1
00:00:08,672 --> 00:00:11,442
>> Sean: JOINING US NOW, LOTS

2
00:00:11,442 --> 00:00:12,509
OF BREAKING NEWS.

3
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:13,343
FLORIDA CONGRESSMAN RON

4
00:00:13,343 --> 00:00:14,311
DeSANTIS I'M HOPING WILL BE

5
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:16,180
THE NEXT GOVERNOR OF THE GREAT

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,315
STATE OF FLORIDA, THE SUNSHINE

7
00:00:18,315 --> 00:00:18,615
STATE.

8
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:20,784
FULL DISCLOSURE FOR YOU DOPES

9
00:00:20,784 --> 00:00:25,122
OVER AT MSNBC, AND SARAH CARTER,

10
00:00:25,122 --> 00:00:26,090
LET'S START WITH YOU.

11
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,324
WHILE I WAS SPEAKING WITH YOU

12
00:00:27,324 --> 00:00:28,726
LAST NIGHT, AND WE WERE SPEAKING

13
00:00:28,726 --> 00:00:30,561
TO OTHER PEOPLE AND WE WERE BOTH

14
00:00:30,561 --> 00:00:32,563
WORKING OUR RESOURCES, AND THEN

15
00:00:32,563 --> 00:00:34,364
AGAIN THIS MORNING AT 7:00,

16
00:00:34,364 --> 00:00:36,300
THERE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE

17
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,302
RELEASED DOCUMENTS FROM THE DOJ

18
00:00:38,302 --> 00:00:41,004
EARLY IN THE MORNING, THEN THEY

19
00:00:41,004 --> 00:00:41,739
PULLED THEM BACK.

20
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:42,706
WHAT HAPPENED?

21
00:00:42,706 --> 00:00:45,576
>> THE DOD GA FIELD TO MENTION

22
00:00:45,576 --> 00:00:47,411
THAT WHEN THEY ISSUED A PRESS

23
00:00:47,411 --> 00:00:50,914
RELEASE -- THE DOJ, SAYING THEY

24
00:00:50,914 --> 00:00:52,282
WOULD TURN OVER DOCUMENTS NEXT

25
00:00:52,282 --> 00:00:54,685
WEEK OR AT LEAST ALLOW CONGRESS

26
00:00:54,685 --> 00:00:56,086
TO REVIEW DOCUMENTS NEXT WEEK

27
00:00:56,086 --> 00:00:57,521
EITHER MONDAY OR TUESDAY, AND

28
00:00:57,521 --> 00:00:59,089
ASK MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

29
00:00:59,089 --> 00:01:00,390
INFORMATION THAT THEY HAD

30
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,293
REQUESTED ON APRIL 24TH, WHICH

31
00:01:03,293 --> 00:01:04,795
WAS A SPECIFIC DOCUMENTATION BY

32
00:01:04,795 --> 00:01:05,562
THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE

33
00:01:05,562 --> 00:01:09,566
THAT WOULD BASICALLY SHED LIGHT

34
00:01:09,566 --> 00:01:10,501
ON THE ENTIRE RUSSIAN

35
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:11,301
INVESTIGATION.

36
00:01:11,301 --> 00:01:12,136
IT IS THESE DOCUMENTS THAT THE

37
00:01:12,136 --> 00:01:16,940
DOJ AND FBI ARE RETURNING TO

38
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,909
TURN OVER TO LAWMAKERS.

39
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:20,911
THEY HAVE BATTLED WITH THEM ON

40
00:01:20,911 --> 00:01:21,812
MAY 24TH, REMEMBER THAT MEETING

41
00:01:21,812 --> 00:01:23,547
THAT THEY HAD TO WEAR THE DOJ

42
00:01:23,547 --> 00:01:26,517
AND FBI WERE SUPPOSED TO SHARE

43
00:01:26,517 --> 00:01:27,885
DOCUMENTS WITH NUNEZ AND

44
00:01:27,885 --> 00:01:29,153
REPRESENTATIVE TREY GOWDY AND

45
00:01:29,153 --> 00:01:30,320
OTHERS, AND THEY DID NOT.

46
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,523
THEY IN FACT TOLD THEM THAT THEY

47
00:01:32,523 --> 00:01:34,324
WOULD NOT SHARE THOSE DOCUMENTS

48
00:01:34,324 --> 00:01:35,492
WITH INVESTIGATORS ON THEIR

49
00:01:35,492 --> 00:01:35,859
COMMITTEE.

50
00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:37,694
SO THIS HAS BEEN A

51
00:01:37,694 --> 00:01:38,262
BACK-AND-FORTH BATTLE.

52
00:01:38,262 --> 00:01:40,898
THEY REFUSED TO TURN THEM OVER

53
00:01:40,898 --> 00:01:42,099
THIS MORNING AND INSTEAD ISSUING

54
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:43,700
A PRESS RELEASE LATE LAST NIGHT

55
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,336
THAT NOBODY WAS AWARE OF EXCEPT

56
00:01:46,336 --> 00:01:47,137
FOR THE REPORTERS.

57
00:01:47,137 --> 00:01:47,938
BUT THE CONGRESSIONAL MEMBERS

58
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:49,540
WERE LEFT IN THE DARK.

59
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,141
THEY HEADED TO CAPITOL HILL AND

60
00:01:51,141 --> 00:01:53,277
WERE WAITING FOR THE DOCUMENTS,

61
00:01:53,277 --> 00:01:55,145
AND ONCE AGAIN, THEY WEREN'T

62
00:01:55,145 --> 00:01:55,445
THERE.

63
00:01:55,445 --> 00:01:56,413
>> Sean: ALL RIGHT, I GOT SOME

64
00:01:56,413 --> 00:01:58,148
BREAKING NEWS IF I CAN THROW THE

65
00:01:58,148 --> 00:01:59,149
SITE YOU WILL.

66
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:00,951
THIS WAS IN

67
00:02:00,951 --> 00:02:02,886
"THE NEW YORK TIMES," FEDERAL

68
00:02:02,886 --> 00:02:03,353
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

69
00:02:03,353 --> 00:02:05,022
THE HEADLINE IS, JUSTICE

70
00:02:05,022 --> 00:02:09,560
DEPARTMENT SEES AS TIMES

71
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,227
REPORTER'S EMAILS AND PHONE

72
00:02:10,227 --> 00:02:11,662
RECORDS IN LEAK INVESTIGATION.

73
00:02:11,662 --> 00:02:12,963
OFFICIALS SECRETLY SEIZING A

74
00:02:12,963 --> 00:02:14,731
YEAR WORTH OF "NEW YORK TIMES"

75
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:15,365
REPORTER'S PHONE AND EMAIL

76
00:02:15,365 --> 00:02:19,703
RECORDS THIS YEAR AND

77
00:02:19,703 --> 00:02:20,504
INVESTIGATION OF CLASSIFIED

78
00:02:20,504 --> 00:02:21,271
INFORMATION LEAKS.

79
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:23,707
EXCUSE ME, DON'T WE HAVE A

80
00:02:23,707 --> 00:02:24,508
FIRST AMENDMENT HERE?

81
00:02:24,508 --> 00:02:26,910
BY THE WAY, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D

82
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,511
BE DEFENDING

83
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:30,247
"THE NEW YORK TIMES," THEY DO

84
00:02:30,247 --> 00:02:30,547
SUCK.

85
00:02:30,547 --> 00:02:31,715
BUT WAIT A MINUTE, THEY DON'T

86
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:33,951
HAVE A RIGHT TO THIS REPORTERS

87
00:02:33,951 --> 00:02:34,918
NOTES AND RECORDS.

88
00:02:34,918 --> 00:02:36,386
ARE THEY ALLOWED TO PROTECT

89
00:02:36,386 --> 00:02:37,354
THEIR SOURCES?

90
00:02:37,354 --> 00:02:39,523
DO WE HAVE FREEDOM OF PRESS?

91
00:02:39,523 --> 00:02:42,125
THAT SOUNDS SCARY TO ME, WHAT'S

92
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,527
YOUR REACTION?

93
00:02:43,527 --> 00:02:46,063
>> IT'S ALSO AGAINST THE

94
00:02:46,063 --> 00:02:47,130
BACKDROP, NO ONE HAS BEEN

95
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,166
PROSECUTED WHO HAS ACTUALLY DONE

96
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,734
LEAKING SINCE THIS

97
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:52,102
ADMINISTRATION TOOK OVER.

98
00:02:52,102 --> 00:02:53,503
REMEMBER MICHAEL FLYNN AT

99
00:02:53,503 --> 00:02:55,939
INTERCEPT, THE PFIZER INTERCEPT,

100
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:58,175
THAT WAS LEAKED GRATUITOUSLY BY

101
00:02:58,175 --> 00:03:00,711
SOMEBODY, PROBABLY AN OBAMA

102
00:03:00,711 --> 00:03:01,111
HOLDOVER.

103
00:03:01,111 --> 00:03:02,312
THERE HAVE BEEN A CASCADE OF

104
00:03:02,312 --> 00:03:03,914
LEAKS AND NO ONE HAS BEEN HELD

105
00:03:03,914 --> 00:03:05,315
ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANY OF THOSE

106
00:03:05,315 --> 00:03:05,716
THINGS.

107
00:03:05,716 --> 00:03:07,517
I NEED MORE INFORMATION ABOUT

108
00:03:07,517 --> 00:03:09,553
WHAT EXACTLY IS HAPPENING HERE.

109
00:03:09,553 --> 00:03:11,221
I KNOW THERE IS A FORMER STAFFER

110
00:03:11,221 --> 00:03:13,123
ON THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE

111
00:03:13,123 --> 00:03:13,924
COMMITTEE THAT IS PROBABLY GOING

112
00:03:13,924 --> 00:03:14,758
TO BE INDICTED.

113
00:03:14,758 --> 00:03:16,526
I'M NOT SURE IF IT WAS WORKING

114
00:03:16,526 --> 00:03:18,528
FOR A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN,

115
00:03:18,528 --> 00:03:19,830
ALTHOUGH I HAVE MY GUESTS.

116
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,999
AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU HAVE

117
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:24,534
A SERIES OF LEAKS AND NO

118
00:03:24,534 --> 00:03:25,736
ACCOUNTABILITY UP TO THIS POINT.

119
00:03:25,736 --> 00:03:27,471
>> Sean: I WILL TELL YOU, THE

120
00:03:27,471 --> 00:03:28,972
NEWS MEDIA, AND THEY WRITE THIS

121
00:03:28,972 --> 00:03:32,609
IN THE TIMES PIECE, MINING A

122
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:34,945
RECORD FOR SOURCES WITH A

123
00:03:34,945 --> 00:03:36,346
MASSIVE INTRUSION INTO THE

124
00:03:36,346 --> 00:03:36,813
FIRST AMENDMENT.

125
00:03:36,813 --> 00:03:38,148
SARAH CARTER, WE WORKED SOURCES

126
00:03:38,148 --> 00:03:39,516
LAST NIGHT AND IT'S NONE OF

127
00:03:39,516 --> 00:03:42,119
THEIR BUSINESS WHO WE TALK TO OR

128
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:45,188
WHO YOU TALK TO, WHO I TALK TO.

129
00:03:45,188 --> 00:03:46,423
MUELLER DOESN'T HAVE A RIGHT TO

130
00:03:46,423 --> 00:03:49,293
THIS INFORMATION.

131
00:03:49,293 --> 00:03:50,127
>> Sarah: ABSOLUTELY.

132
00:03:50,127 --> 00:03:52,930
I THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT OVERALL,

133
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,898
WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING HERE,

134
00:03:54,898 --> 00:03:55,198
LOOK.

135
00:03:55,198 --> 00:03:57,100
JAMES CLAPPER HAS NOW BEEN OUTED

136
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,937
PRETTY MUCH AS SOMEONE WHO THE

137
00:03:59,937 --> 00:04:01,738
CONGRESS BELIEVES HAD LEAKED

138
00:04:01,738 --> 00:04:03,173
INFORMATION TO CNN.

139
00:04:03,173 --> 00:04:05,475
WE KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT

140
00:04:05,475 --> 00:04:07,411
CONVERSATIONS              'S

141
00:04:07,411 --> 00:04:08,078
PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS WERE

142
00:04:08,078 --> 00:04:09,112
LINKED TO THE MEDIA, BUT THAT

143
00:04:09,112 --> 00:04:11,848
DOES NOT GIVE THE RIGHT FOR THE

144
00:04:11,848 --> 00:04:16,920
DOJ TO START MINING REPORTERS'

145
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,521
TELEPHONE NUMBERS, AND

146
00:04:17,521 --> 00:04:19,589
INFORMATION TO TRY TO FIND OUT

147
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:20,724
WHO WAS THE LEAKER.

148
00:04:20,724 --> 00:04:22,326
I THINK THEY PRETTY MUCH KNOW

149
00:04:22,326 --> 00:04:25,362
WHERE THE LEAKS ARE COMING FROM.

150
00:04:25,362 --> 00:04:26,096
GIVE POLYGRAPHS.

151
00:04:26,096 --> 00:04:28,098
>> Sean: MAYBE THERE IS A LEAK

152
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:30,801
AT THEIR OWN OFFICE.

153
00:04:30,801 --> 00:04:33,136
>> Sarah: EXACTLY.

154
00:04:33,136 --> 00:04:34,104
IF MIKE FLYNN GAVE SOME

155
00:04:34,104 --> 00:04:35,906
POLYGRAPHS TO FIND OUT WHO WAS

156
00:04:35,906 --> 00:04:38,308
LEAKING INSIDE OF THE DOJ OR THE

157
00:04:38,308 --> 00:04:40,544
OFFICE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION,

158
00:04:40,544 --> 00:04:41,878
THESE ARE HIGHLY CLASSIFIED

159
00:04:41,878 --> 00:04:42,179
LEAKS.

160
00:04:42,179 --> 00:04:44,147
>> Sean: THIS IS HUGE NEWS AND

161
00:04:44,147 --> 00:04:46,149
I'M JUST PUTTING THIS TOGETHER.

162
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:47,384
"THE NEW YORK TIMES," EVEN THEIR

163
00:04:47,384 --> 00:04:48,285
OWN LEADERSHIP IS COMMENTING ON

164
00:04:48,285 --> 00:04:51,288
THIS.

165
00:04:51,288 --> 00:04:52,122
MAYBE THEY WILL REALIZE THAT

166
00:04:52,122 --> 00:04:55,292
PEOPLE LIKE SEAN HANNITY AND

167
00:04:55,292 --> 00:04:56,293
SARAH CARTER AND GREGG JARRETT

168
00:04:56,293 --> 00:04:58,829
AND SO MANY OF US WERE RIGHT,

169
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:01,498
BECAUSE WE POINTED OUT PFIZER

170
00:05:01,498 --> 00:05:02,966
ABUSES, LYING TO PFIZER COURT

171
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:05,836
JUSTICES, OMISSION BY LYING TO

172
00:05:05,836 --> 00:05:07,170
PFIZER COURT JUSTICES, AND,

173
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,373
HILLARY CLINTON'S CRIMES, AND

174
00:05:09,373 --> 00:05:13,510
THE DUAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THIS

175
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,613
COUNTRY, ONE FOR HILLARY, AND

176
00:05:16,613 --> 00:05:17,514
FIXING INVESTIGATIONS WITH

177
00:05:17,514 --> 00:05:18,715
EVERYTHING ASSOCIATED WITH THIS.

178
00:05:18,715 --> 00:05:21,318
THAT HAS BEEN OUR POINT THE

179
00:05:21,318 --> 00:05:23,286
ENTIRE TIME.

180
00:05:23,286 --> 00:05:25,722
HOW DO WE GET TO THE BOTTOM OF

181
00:05:25,722 --> 00:05:26,023
THIS?

182
00:05:26,023 --> 00:05:27,724
>> AND COME UP THEY FIGHT TOOTH

183
00:05:27,724 --> 00:05:30,093
AND NAIL TO PROVIDE THE AMERICAN

184
00:05:30,093 --> 00:05:31,928
PEOPLE THE TRUTH ABOUT

185
00:05:31,928 --> 00:05:32,696
ACTIVITIES.

186
00:05:32,696 --> 00:05:33,797
ROSENSTEIN, AS SARAH SAID IT,

187
00:05:33,797 --> 00:05:35,699
EVEN JUST LAST NIGHT WAS

188
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:38,068
REFUSING TO TURN OVER THESE

189
00:05:38,068 --> 00:05:39,302
DOCUMENTS.

190
00:05:39,302 --> 00:05:40,370
THEY ARE BREAKING CERTAIN

191
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,705
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS SAYING, THIS

192
00:05:41,705 --> 00:05:43,373
IS EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT THE FBI

193
00:05:43,373 --> 00:05:44,107
TO DO.

194
00:05:44,107 --> 00:05:46,309
IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN, SO THE

195
00:05:46,309 --> 00:05:47,677
AMERICAN PEOPLE TO DOCUMENTS,

196
00:05:47,677 --> 00:05:49,713
SHOW CONGRESS, SO WE CAN SEE HOW

197
00:05:49,713 --> 00:05:50,747
GOOD OF A JOB YOU DID.

198
00:05:50,747 --> 00:05:52,215
THE FACT THAT THEY ARE NOT

199
00:05:52,215 --> 00:05:53,717
WILLING TO DO THAT TELLS ME THAT

200
00:05:53,717 --> 00:05:55,118
THERE WERE PROBLEMS FROM THE

201
00:05:55,118 --> 00:05:57,654
VERY BEGINNING OF THIS SO-CALLED

202
00:05:57,654 --> 00:05:58,922
COLLUSION INVESTIGATION.

203
00:05:58,922 --> 00:06:00,524
THEY WON'T SHOW US THE

204
00:06:00,524 --> 00:06:01,792
PAPADOPOULOS STUFF, THEY WON'T

205
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:04,027
SHOW US THE INFORMATION ABOUT

206
00:06:04,027 --> 00:06:04,361
HELPER.

207
00:06:04,361 --> 00:06:06,296
YOU HAVE TO ASK WHY THEY WON'T

208
00:06:06,296 --> 00:06:09,900
COME CLEAN.

209
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,368
>> Sarah: WHAT WAS THE SCOPE

210
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:12,369
OF ALL OF THIS?

211
00:06:12,369 --> 00:06:15,138
I THINK WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS

212
00:06:15,138 --> 00:06:17,507
ONE SMALL PORTION OF MASSIVE

213
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:19,109
ABUSE, AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

214
00:06:19,109 --> 00:06:19,976
DESERVE THE TRUTH BECAUSE OUR

215
00:06:19,976 --> 00:06:22,279
COUNTRY RELIES ON THE FOUNDATION

216
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:24,314
THAT WE BUILT OURSELVES UPON AND

217
00:06:24,314 --> 00:00:00,000
IT'S NOT MEANT FOR SPYING, IT'S
