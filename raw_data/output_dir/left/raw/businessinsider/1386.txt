my dad was an idea a minute kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,280
entrepreneur he had lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> and lots of</font>

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,670
good ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> he had big ideas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sadly he</font>

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,400
also had a flaw<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is that he would</font>

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,970
expand<font color="#E5E5E5"> either too quickly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or without</font>

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">having first surrounded himself with a</font>

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,529
team of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who were way better at</font>

8
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:25,320
what they knew how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do and then he was</font>

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,420
he sadly<font color="#E5E5E5"> would often surround himself</font>

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,369
with people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who were great at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> making him</font>

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:34,410
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the big guy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I took both</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,920
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> lessons for many many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years I was</font>

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,750
right to<font color="#CCCCCC"> take the second</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lesson to</font>

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,840
always surround myself with<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who</font>

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,620
are way way<font color="#E5E5E5"> better than I am way smarter</font>

16
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">but I think I made a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> big mistake</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,420
believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had two</font>

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,940
bankruptcies was because he expanded and

19
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,399
so for that reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 year</font>

20
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,770
restaurant career<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had one restaurant</font>

21
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first 10 of those years and even</font>

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:03,000
Shake Shack<font color="#E5E5E5"> which now has a hundred and</font>

one shacks

24
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,210
around the world we had one<font color="#E5E5E5"> Shack for</font>

25
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,010
the first five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I think an</font>

26
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,979
important lesson<font color="#E5E5E5"> I learned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was that</font>

27
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:13,860
growth itself does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not need to mean that</font>

28
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,479
you have diminished your culture<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

29
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">certainly it doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put you out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">business as a matter of fact</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I now</font>

31
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,930
believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the right kind</font>

32
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,290
of support<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you sometimes need to</font>

33
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,420
expand in order to advance<font color="#CCCCCC"> your culture</font>

34
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if you don't grow quickly enough</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

35
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,490
appropriately enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're gonna lose</font>

the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of talented</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people whose</font>

37

aspirations cannot be met by your small

company<font color="#E5E5E5"> so my big lesson was stop</font>

39

playing small but do continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play</font>
