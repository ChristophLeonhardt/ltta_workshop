00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,929
edition before I say anything else we

oral<font color="#E5E5E5"> house match and actually I think</font>

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite a lot of streets had a power cut</font>

6
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,320
meaning i have to do on my least

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,580
favorite things to do in the whole

8
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,320
entire world it's just under getting rid

9
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,240
of spiders taking exams and then maybe

10
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,520
claiming tax back and that is resetting

11
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,529
my alarm clock does<font color="#E5E5E5"> having to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

12
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:21,000
annoy everyone else as much it doesn't

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,960
me because you have to sit there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

14
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,400
just press all the buttons and keep

15
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,740
pressing ah a couple of days<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

16
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,210
do-it-yourself challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> I set myself</font>

17
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,189
some creative challenges today's mission

18
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:30,750
is actually extremely similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

19
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,369
painting challenge I guess except it's

20
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,230
more face based it's called picture

21
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,149
perfect and it's your challenges create

22
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:38,010
portrait of yourself a friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> or family</font>

23
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">member now as we all know I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

24
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,910
any<font color="#CCCCCC"> friends and my family are all far</font>

25
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,680
far away in the land of London so I had

26
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,390
to brave drawing myself and I'm just uh

27
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,399
I'm just not<font color="#CCCCCC"> very good drawing and I</font>

28
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,719
chose drawing because I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good</font>

29
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">at painting especially when it comes to</font>

30
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,320
like faces and thing and I chose drawing

31
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,000
with bio because I'm really<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just I</font>

32
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,620
hate pencils I've really apart from

33
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,510
coloring pencils I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know what it is</font>

34
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">about pencils i don't i don't like them</font>

35
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,870
they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't work for me and during</font>

36
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,460
these days in general you found all the

37
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,049
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to which was Jana is fiercely</font>

38
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,659
opposed numbers pencils actually that's

39
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,460
probably it i think pencils remind me of

40
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,020
a traumatic experience in the math

41
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,510
department involving you know having<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:21,119
there's so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> science in my life right</font>

47
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,119
now is sort of unnerving and weird weird

48
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,830
weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird so tried to draw myself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

53
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,850
thing i've ever drawn so yeah that's

54
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,290
supposedly me don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know what was</font>

55
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">going on there can we concentrate more</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">my favorite illustrators she does he</font>

59
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,810
lists writes children's books but he's

60
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,100
just one of my favorite illustrators in

61
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,899
general he he does these incredible

62
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,350
incredible illustrations one of my

favorite books<font color="#E5E5E5"> of his is called the</font>

64
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,049
arrival which is a book entirely without

65
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:00,060
words and it's quite long but you know

66
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,469
your average<font color="#CCCCCC"> sheron's pitch book which</font>

67
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:02,729
makes me think it's not really in the

68
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:04,229
traditional you know picture book

69
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:06,000
demographic he also did the red tree the

a genius and he's an Australian genies

77
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,300
if my memory serves me correctly<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

78
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,620
believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago he</font>

it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like something we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dig it like a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">ridiculous amount of money it's much</font>

83
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,820
deserved because Sean town is amazing I

84
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">always used to love to join stuff and</font>

85
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,780
I've always always<font color="#E5E5E5"> been an avid doula</font>

86
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">and for anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and everything but as</font>

87
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,870
my mom always says when I had to take

88
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,730
art in school and we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> very much</font>

89
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">judged and kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I always felt</font>

90
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,500
ranked against everyone else and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I only</font>

91
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,630
took art<font color="#E5E5E5"> from you 70 and nine so that's</font>

92
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,060
like 12 to 14 they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> always so</font>

93
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,220
critical i found it so so hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

94
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,510
felt they weren't very patient with me

95
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">and during that span of three years I</font>

96
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,600
didn't really draw much at all but my

97
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,070
mom always says<font color="#CCCCCC"> the second</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you finished</font>

98
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,630
in the second you didn't have to do it

99
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,070
and second you didn't feel like you were

100
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,900
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> school pressure for it then you</font>

101
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,460
started drawing again so that's one

102
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,170
thing that sometimes although I

103
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,300
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> one hundred percent for our</font>

104
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,460
education in schools sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I worry</font>

105
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,140
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment you start ranking people</font>

106
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,450
and and being just just that a little

107
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,250
bit too critical you really destroy

108
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,959
people's love of something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

109
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,120
they wreck reiation enjoy anyway but it

110
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,830
really is a fine line<font color="#E5E5E5"> but tell me hear</font>

111
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,000
you do in comments and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you made a</font>

112
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,590
video<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your drawing then do you post</font>

113
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,300
it as a video response and now I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

114
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">go make my way through that big stack of</font>

115
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,690
bricks over there I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if I</font>

116
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,340
mentioned this in an earlier video but

117
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,470
my dissertation is partly on terrorism

118
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,239
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I damn it does very much about the</font>

119
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,010
sep tember<font color="#CCCCCC"> 11th attack so if you go into</font>

120
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,330
the library<font color="#E5E5E5"> and taking out these books</font>

121
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,860
on terrorism I think I<font color="#E5E5E5"> must be on the</font>

122
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,690
list someone luckily book issuing is

123
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,100
done through like a machine so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font>

124
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,510
have to go up and take all these books

125
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,340
of terrorism to the librarian but I have

126
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,630
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of cases where like the</font>

127
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,100
library<font color="#CCCCCC"> I she's wandering around putting</font>

128
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,330
things back onto the shelves and I'm

129
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,440
literally taking out like this huge

130
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,200
stack of books like 911 and threats of

131
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,840
terrorism and war disease and all these

132
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,360
things at once so yeah that's good I'm

133
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,920
