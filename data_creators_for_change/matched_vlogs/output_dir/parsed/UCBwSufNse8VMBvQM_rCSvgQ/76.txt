it's on the match Cara where were you
kill me stay inside
mine attack attack you
I think we need to do is roll
okay so um turns out Kyra's fall was
quite nasty let's get a replay on that
but guys I think we should maybe pay
some respect to the injured ones today
what happened

Martin was your injury on car what have
you done to it
calf muscle Bros oh gosh more swelling
just what happened there mr. Bourg works
at erase mother was your injury my head
what what's wrong with your head just
hurts with all this is going on is it
for me yeah so yeah we've had the
takedown we've had the race
and we've had the constant pranks I'd
like to just pay some respect to the
injured ones with 10 second silence
thank you morning mom mom what'd you do

either hurt somebody cause somebody to
get hurt or I get wet through this isn't

wars why am i shouting into the camera
when she's yes prank wars with mum is
now back I am I'm pretty scared I'm not
gonna lie you know what me and mom have
been pranking each other for a while and
I think I need to take this a step
further me and Kira we've done a few
pranks on each other but we've never
really had a prank war going on you know
me and mum were at war mean Kira have
never really had that battle and I think
guys maybe it's time we do the most
savage prank ever and initiate prank
wars with Kira and mom
now Kira is in the shower right now we
kind of made up like we were speaking we
were cool we were fine but I think what
I'm gonna do is fill a bowl or a bucket
with snow and basically put the snow on
Kara guys you know what before you all
comment down below and boards this is
way too far I know okay I know this is
really really far however if me
kara are gonna start our own prank war

snow and do that in a minute
