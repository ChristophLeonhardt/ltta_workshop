1
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:07,493
>> Tucker: RECENTLY

2
00:00:07,494 --> 00:00:08,260
HILLARY CLINTON SAID THAT BRETT

3
00:00:08,261 --> 00:00:09,462
KAVANAUGH COULD NOT BE ALLOWED

4
00:00:09,463 --> 00:00:10,763
ON THE SUPREME COURT.

5
00:00:10,764 --> 00:00:12,431
WE HAD TO BELIEVE HIS ACCUSER

6
00:00:12,432 --> 00:00:18,604
SHE SAID, EVEN WITHOUT EVIDENCE.

7
00:00:18,605 --> 00:00:21,674
IT WASN'T TOO SURPRISING THAT ON

8
00:00:21,675 --> 00:00:22,908
SUNDAY SHE BACKTRACKED AND SHE

9
00:00:22,909 --> 00:00:25,244
TOLD CBS THAT HER OWN HUSBAND

10
00:00:25,245 --> 00:00:26,278
HAD NO OBLIGATION TO RESIGN OVER

11
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,581
THE MONICA LEWINSKY SCANDAL.

12
00:00:28,582 --> 00:00:29,849
>> SOME TODAY HAD SAID HE SHOULD

13
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,384
HAVE STEPPED DOWN.

14
00:00:32,384 --> 00:00:34,353
>> IN RETROSPECT, DO YOU THINK

15
00:00:34,354 --> 00:00:36,722
BILL SHOULD HAVE RESIGNED IN THE

16
00:00:36,723 --> 00:00:38,157
WAKE OF THE MONICA LEWINSKY

17
00:00:38,158 --> 00:00:38,491
SCANDAL?

18
00:00:38,492 --> 00:00:39,358
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.

19
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:41,093
>> WASN'T AN ABUSE OF POWER?

20
00:00:41,094 --> 00:00:45,264
>> NO.

21
00:00:45,265 --> 00:00:47,299
PEOPLE SAY PRESIDENT OF THE

22
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,969
UNITED STATES CANNOT HAVE A

23
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,370
CONSENSUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH AN

24
00:00:51,371 --> 00:00:53,172
INTERN, THE POWER IMBALANCES TOO

25
00:00:53,173 --> 00:00:53,472
MUCH.

26
00:00:53,473 --> 00:00:55,174
>> SHE WAS AN ADULT.

27
00:00:55,175 --> 00:00:58,577
LET ME ASK YOU THIS, WHERE'S THE

28
00:00:58,578 --> 00:00:59,979
INVESTIGATION?

29
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,313
>> Tucker: EVEN THE LADIES OF

30
00:01:01,314 --> 00:01:03,349
THE VIEW ARE NOT BUYING THIS

31
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,917
LINE OF ARGUMENT, AND SAID THEY

32
00:01:04,918 --> 00:01:05,718
RIPPED HILLARY CLINTON BELIEVE

33
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:06,819
IT OR NOT FOR HER ABRASIVE

34
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,355
INTERVIEW TACTICS.

35
00:01:09,356 --> 00:01:10,656
>> WHAT SHE JUST SAID IS EXACTLY

36
00:01:10,657 --> 00:01:13,993
WHAT THE REPUBLICANS DO, THEY

37
00:01:13,994 --> 00:01:14,894
CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

38
00:01:14,895 --> 00:01:16,595
THAT IS WHY WE NEVER GET

39
00:01:16,596 --> 00:01:17,396
ANYWHERE IN THE UTERUS.

40
00:01:17,397 --> 00:01:19,900
>> YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A

41
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:20,901
BAD

42
00:01:21,334 --> 00:01:22,001
ARGUMENT WHEN YOUR MEETING

43
00:01:22,002 --> 00:01:24,036
ARGUMENT IS, THEY ARE WORSE.

44
00:01:24,037 --> 00:01:29,975
SHE CAN HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.

45
00:01:29,976 --> 00:01:30,943
KATHLEEN WIDELY CLAIMS THE

46
00:01:30,944 --> 00:01:32,344
CLINTONS TRIED TO INTIMIDATE

47
00:01:32,345 --> 00:01:32,611
HER.

48
00:01:32,612 --> 00:01:34,413
SHE CALLED MONICA LEWINSKY AND

49
00:01:34,414 --> 00:01:38,751
ARE         A

50
00:01:38,752 --> 00:01:39,151
NARCISSIST.

51
00:01:39,152 --> 00:01:40,519
THEY HAVE TO MOVE ON.

52
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,322
>> Tucker: CAMILLE POLLY IS AN

53
00:01:43,323 --> 00:01:44,523
AUTHOR AND A CULTURAL CRITIC,

54
00:01:44,524 --> 00:01:47,092
SHE HAS WRITTEN EXTENSIVELY

55
00:01:47,093 --> 00:01:48,694
ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.

56
00:01:48,695 --> 00:01:50,563
HER LATEST BOOK IS TITLED

57
00:01:50,564 --> 00:01:51,730
"PROVOCATIONS."

58
00:01:51,731 --> 00:01:52,164
SHE JOINS US.

59
00:01:52,165 --> 00:01:54,667
THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.

60
00:01:54,668 --> 00:01:57,169
>> THANK YOU.

61
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,838
>> Tucker: HILLARY CLINTON IS

62
00:01:58,839 --> 00:01:59,939
MENTIONED ON THIS BOOK.

63
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,907
LET ME ASK YOU SOME BROADER

64
00:02:01,908 --> 00:02:03,075
QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS COUNTRY,

65
00:02:03,076 --> 00:02:05,711
WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO HER

66
00:02:05,712 --> 00:02:07,847
ROLE AND THE KIND OF ME TOO

67
00:02:07,848 --> 00:02:08,948
MOVEMENT?

68
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:12,151
>> IT IS VERY AMBIGUOUS.

69
00:02:12,152 --> 00:02:13,752
I THINK HER HISTORY HAS BEEN

70
00:02:13,753 --> 00:02:14,186
HYPOCRITICAL.

71
00:02:14,187 --> 00:02:16,922
I WAS THE ONLY DEMOCRAT FEMINIST

72
00:02:16,923 --> 00:02:18,023
TO CALL FOR BILL CLINTON'S

73
00:02:18,024 --> 00:02:22,494
RESIGNATION AND DEVOTED        I

74
00:02:22,495 --> 00:02:22,528
RESIGNATION AND DEVOTED        V

75
00:02:22,529 --> 00:02:22,561
RESIGNATION AND DEVOTED        T

76
00:02:22,562 --> 00:02:22,595
RESIGNATION AND DEVOTED        D

77
00:02:22,596 --> 00:02:22,628
RESIGNATION AND DEVOTED        F

78
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:22,661
RESIGNATION AND DEVOTED        R

79
00:02:22,662 --> 00:02:22,695
RESIGNATION AND DEVOTED        H

80
00:02:22,696 --> 00:02:24,663
RESIGNATION AND DEVOTED        M

81
00:02:24,664 --> 00:02:25,464
TWICE.

82
00:02:25,465 --> 00:02:29,335
ALL THIS WAS HAPPENING, THE

83
00:02:29,336 --> 00:02:31,170
SERVICING OF HIM BY AND ENTER IN

84
00:02:31,171 --> 00:02:33,372
IN THE WHITE HOUSE OFFICES.

85
00:02:33,373 --> 00:02:34,874
>> Tucker: IT IS A GOOD POINT

86
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,709
IN A GOOD REMINDER.

87
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:43,249
AS SOMEONE WHO HAS WRITTEN ABOUT

88
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,051
SEX, GENDER ROLES, WHAT DO YOU

89
00:02:46,052 --> 00:02:48,354
MAKE OF THE CONVULSION WE ARE

90
00:02:48,355 --> 00:02:49,154
GOING TO PARTICULARLY OF THE ME

91
00:02:49,155 --> 00:02:50,589
TOO MOVEMENT?

92
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,627
>> IT IS GREAT, THAT ATTENTION

93
00:02:54,628 --> 00:02:57,429
IS BEING MADE TO THE WOMEN BEING

94
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,230
ABUSE.

95
00:02:58,231 --> 00:03:01,333
I WAS LOBBYING FOR MODERATE

96
00:03:01,334 --> 00:03:02,001
HARASSMENT GUIDELINES IN MY

97
00:03:02,002 --> 00:03:04,803
UNIVERSITY IN PHILADELPHIA.

98
00:03:04,804 --> 00:03:05,504
I THINK WE HAVE GONE A LITTLE

99
00:03:05,505 --> 00:03:10,342
BIT TOO FAR HERE.

100
00:03:10,343 --> 00:03:11,377
FOLLOWING THE PRESUMPTION OF

101
00:03:11,378 --> 00:03:12,044
INNOCENCE, THEY HAVE TO BE

102
00:03:12,045 --> 00:03:12,444
CONSIDERED.

103
00:03:12,445 --> 00:03:16,048
WHAT I AM SAY AS A FEMINIST IS

104
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:18,350
THAT WOMEN THEMSELVES MUST TAKE

105
00:03:18,351 --> 00:03:19,118
CHARGE OF THEIR OWN INTERACTIONS

106
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:21,720
WITH MEN.

107
00:03:21,721 --> 00:03:23,489
THEY MUST SIGNAL AT THE TIME

108
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,291
THAT SOMETHING IS UNACCEPTABLE.

109
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:26,292
THIS WAITING TEN YEARS, 20

110
00:03:26,293 --> 00:03:30,729
YEARS, 30 YEARS, IT IS NOT

111
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,331
AMERICAN, IT IS STALINIST.

112
00:03:32,332 --> 00:03:34,033
>> Tucker: WOMEN WERE TOLD

113
00:03:34,034 --> 00:03:34,767
AGAIN AND AGAIN BY PEOPLE WHO

114
00:03:34,768 --> 00:03:38,537
CLAIMED TO EMPOWER WOMEN ARE

115
00:03:38,538 --> 00:03:39,238
THEMSELVES POWERLESS AND THEY

116
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,141
CAN'T SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE THEY

117
00:03:42,142 --> 00:03:44,343
ARE SO LACKING IN POWER.

118
00:03:44,344 --> 00:03:45,945
>> NONSENSE.

119
00:03:45,946 --> 00:03:46,612
WORKING-CLASS WOMEN, YES.

120
00:03:46,613 --> 00:03:49,148
MAY BE DEPENDENT ON A JOB THAT

121
00:03:49,149 --> 00:03:50,416
THEY CANNOT PROTEST BUT AS I'VE

122
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:54,086
WRITTEN THERE ARE NO EXCUSES FOR

123
00:03:54,087 --> 00:03:56,088
WELL EDUCATED UPPER-MIDDLE-CLASS

124
00:03:56,089 --> 00:03:56,722
PROFESSIONAL WOMEN TO LET

125
00:03:56,723 --> 00:04:00,526
OFFENSES TO THEIR DIGNITY GO BY.

126
00:04:00,527 --> 00:04:02,528
YOU MUST DRAW THE LINE WHEN IT

127
00:04:02,529 --> 00:04:02,861
HAPPENS.

128
00:04:02,862 --> 00:04:05,464
IT IS ABSURD THAT YOU FEEL TOO

129
00:04:05,465 --> 00:04:05,831
POWERLESS.

130
00:04:05,832 --> 00:04:07,499
YOU CAN'T COMPLAIN.

131
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,136
WOMEN WHO SAY THAT ARE SIMPLY

132
00:04:11,137 --> 00:04:12,471
PUTTING THE CAREER ADVANTAGE

133
00:04:12,472 --> 00:04:14,139
OVER THE LARGER QUESTION OF

134
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:14,740
FEMINIST ISSUES AND THE

135
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:16,408
PRODUCTION OF WOMEN.

136
00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:20,379
>> Tucker: YOU HAVE WRITTEN SO

137
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,116
MUCH ABOUT WHO MAY BE A SEX WHAT

138
00:04:24,117 --> 00:04:25,117
DO YOU MAKE ABOUT SEEING YOUR

139
00:04:25,118 --> 00:04:29,621
ALLIES ON THE LEFT STRIKE A

140
00:04:29,622 --> 00:04:31,657
PURITAN POSITION ON THESE

141
00:04:31,658 --> 00:04:32,725
QUESTIONS?

142
00:04:32,726 --> 00:04:37,496
A KIND OF BLEW NOAH'S OUTRAGE AT

143
00:04:37,497 --> 00:04:38,098
SENSUAL PLEASURE,

144
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:39,264
PERSONAL HAPPINESS, TELLING YOU

145
00:04:39,265 --> 00:04:40,499
THAT YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO

146
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:40,933
THIS OR THAT.

147
00:04:40,934 --> 00:04:43,736
WHAT HE MAKE THAT?

148
00:04:43,737 --> 00:04:46,438
>> THERE'S BEEN A SPLIT WITHIN

149
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:46,939
FEMINISM.

150
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,141
SINCE I CAN WAVE FEMINISM, THE

151
00:04:49,142 --> 00:04:50,142
MEDIA HAS BEEN EXTREMELY LAZY

152
00:04:50,143 --> 00:04:52,611
AND PURSUING THIS.

153
00:04:52,612 --> 00:04:56,115
I BELONG TO THE PRO SEX AND

154
00:04:56,116 --> 00:04:59,318
CULTURE OF FEMINISM.

155
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:02,921
I FAVOR THE LEGALIZATION OF, I

156
00:05:02,922 --> 00:05:04,223
HAVE DEFENDED PORN.

157
00:05:04,224 --> 00:05:04,590
ET CETERA.

158
00:05:04,591 --> 00:05:05,357
THERE'S BEEN THIS ARGUMENT FOR A

159
00:05:05,358 --> 00:05:08,694
VERY LONG TIME.

160
00:05:08,695 --> 00:05:11,597
MY BRANCH IN THE 90s THANKS TO

161
00:05:11,598 --> 00:05:12,998
MADONNA SUDDENLY BURSTING ON THE

162
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:13,332
SCENES.

163
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,368
SHE IS FADED, AND ALL SENSE OF

164
00:05:16,369 --> 00:05:18,437
HER OWN TRAJECTORY AND I AM

165
00:05:18,438 --> 00:05:21,407
ASTONISHED THAT WE ARE BACK TO

166
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:26,311
FEMINIST PURITANISM AGAIN.

167
00:05:26,312 --> 00:05:27,646
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MENTAL

168
00:05:27,647 --> 00:05:29,748
IMBALANCE.

169
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:31,316
HYSTERIA, THAT IS NOTHING TO DO

170
00:05:31,317 --> 00:05:31,850
WITH WOMEN'S RIGHTS.

171
00:05:31,851 --> 00:05:35,721
THESE ARE NEUROTICS WHO ARE

172
00:05:35,722 --> 00:05:37,556
TALKING ABOUT HATRED OF MEN, WHO

173
00:05:37,557 --> 00:05:39,124
ARE POISONING THE CULTURE.

174
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,726
MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR A

175
00:05:40,727 --> 00:05:42,127
YOUNG WOMAN TO RECONCILE WITH

176
00:05:42,128 --> 00:05:43,729
YOUNG MEN.

177
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,531
>> Tucker: YOU MIGHT NOT AGREE

178
00:05:45,532 --> 00:05:46,398
DEALT WITH CAMILLE POLLY IF

179
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,666
YOU'RE WATCHING THE SHOW, BUT

180
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:49,134
TRUST ME ONE OF THE MOST

181
00:05:49,135 --> 00:00:00,000
INTERESTING PEOPLE.
