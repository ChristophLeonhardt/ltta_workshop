1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,770
if you raise the minimum wage in a

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,959
gradual way then you don't get as much

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:05,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a negative</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> effects and those negative</font>

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:07,589
effects are the fact that unit<font color="#CCCCCC"> labor</font>

5
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:10,410
costs for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> businesses that employ</font>

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,349
these minimum wage employees rise and so

7
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:15,240
they're likely to either substitute that

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">labor for either automation or actually</font>

9
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,240
hire fewer individuals on top<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,580
there's the likelihood that the employer

11
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,039
that's employing a minimum<font color="#CCCCCC"> wage worker</font>

12
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,050
and has higher<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs might pass on these</font>

13
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,150
costs to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> final consumer and raise</font>

14
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,940
the cost of their own products those are

15
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,530
negative effects but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> positive is</font>

16
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,469
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minimum income wage</font>

17
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:40,110
earners are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> individuals at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

18
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,600
low<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the income spectrum and the</font>

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,610
potential boost from raising the minimum

20
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,309
wage in terms of activity in terms of

21
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:49,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">spending can be quite high so the two</font>

22
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,539
effects tends<font color="#E5E5E5"> to balance out especially</font>

23
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">if it's done over a long period of time</font>

24
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,250
now I think raising the minimum wage to

25
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,050
$15 which would be nearly doubling it

26
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,300
from from current levels would actually

27
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,010
be quite a substantial feed something

28
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,570
that's never been done in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past I</font>

29
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,720
think it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be too much too quickly</font>

30
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,939
but that's also a proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> that she has</font>

31
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:11,189
adopted<font color="#CCCCCC"> following a pull to the left</font>

32
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:12,960
during<font color="#CCCCCC"> the primaries where Bernie</font>

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,939
Sanders was actually advocating for that

34
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,860
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we also have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be careful</font>

35
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,960
with what Hillary Clinton has proposed

36
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,150
in terms of her policy proposals and

37
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,880
what could go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through Congress as you</font>

38
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,040
may know the Senate race is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

39
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite tight and in the end it's really</font>

40
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,570
the Senate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that decides upon these these</font>

41
00:01:30,570 --> 00:00:00,000
proposals
