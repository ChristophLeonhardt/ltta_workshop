SOUTH KOREA.
>> Sandra: PETE KING IS A
MEMBER OF THE HOUSE HOMELAND
SECURITY COMMITTEE.
GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON.
BREAKING NEWS.
PULL OUT OF THE SUMMIT.
YOUR THOUGHTS.
>> I WAS WITH THE PRESIDENT ALL
DAY YESTERDAY AND HE WAS STILL
HOPEFUL AT THAT TIME THAT THE
SUMMIT WAS GOING TO GO AHEAD.
HE WASN'T 100% BUT THOUGHT IT
WAS GOING IN THE RIGHT
DIRECTION.
THE STATEMENT FROM NORTH KOREA
MADE IT CLEAR TO THE PRESIDENT
AT THIS TIME IT SERVED NO
PURPOSE.
I THINK IT IS IN BASEBALL A
LONG SEASON.
THIS IS -- I DON'T THINK IT'S
OVER.
I THINK THE SUMMIT IS NOT GOING
TO BE HELD.
I THINK THE DIALOGUE THAT WAS
BEGUN WILL CONTINUE AND IT
SHOWS THE PRESIDENT IS NOT JUST
LOOKING FOR A DEAL FOR THE SAKE
OF MAKING A DEAL.
IF NORTH KOREA ISN'T GOING TO
BARGAIN IN GOOD FAITH HE ISN'T
GOING TO GO THROUGH THE
THEATRICS OF A SUMMIT.
STILL A WAYS TO GO AND THE
PRESIDENT HAS A NUMBER OF YEARS
LEFT IN HIS ADMINISTRATION,
HOPEFULLY THE NEXT
ADMINISTRATION AND I BELIEVE
THAT THE NORTH KOREA DOES SHOW
THEY ARE CONCERNED AND WHY THEY
WANTED THE SUMMIT IN THE FIRST
PLACE AND THAT IF THEY CAN PLAY
GAMES WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP HE
SHOWED TODAY IT WON'T WORK.
>> Sandra: THE ADMINISTRATION
POSITION AS OF YESTERDAY WORDED
BY MIKE POMPEO.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE
COUNTING ON US TO GET THIS
RIGHT.
IF THE RIGHT DEAL IS NOT ON THE
TABLE WE WILL RESPECTFULLY WALK
AWAY AND THEY HAVE.
IN THAT LETTER FROM THE
PRESIDENT TO KIM JONG-UN
MOMENTS AGO, THE PRESIDENT SAID
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND HAVING
TO DO WITH THIS MOST IMPORTANT
SUMMIT, PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE
TO CALL OR WRITE.
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT MADE
IT CLEAR HE DOES WANT TO
NEGOTIATE IF THERE IS A PURPOSE
IN NEGOTIATING.
AND IF NORTH KOREA IS SERIOUS,
THE PRESIDENT IS WILLING TO
MEET THEM.
HE IS NOT GOING TO GO FOR THE
THEATRICS OF A SUMMIT.
HE WON'T MAKE A DEAL LIKE
PRESIDENT OBAMA DID WITH IRAN.
HE WANTS IT TO BE A PRODUCTIVE
SERIES OF TALKS AND
NEGOTIATIONS.
THE WAY NORTH KOREA WAS GOING
THE LATEST STATEMENT THEY WERE
MORE INTERESTED IN MAKING A
SHOW AND A POINT RATHER THAN
ACTUALLY BEING SERIOUS ABOUT
THE TALKS.
SO I UNDERSTAND WHY THE
PRESIDENT DID IT.
AND AGAIN WE HAVE A GREAT DEP
-- DIPLOMATIC TEAM.
THEY WON'T RUSH INTO ANY SUMMIT
IF THERE ISN'T A REASONABLE
EXPECTATION OF SUCCESS.
>> Sandra: YOU HAVE MIKE POMPEO
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF YOUR
SCREEN THERE TESTIFYING RIGHT
NOW BEFORE THE SENATE FOREIGN
RELATIONS COMMITTEE.
HE WAS IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE
COMMITTEE YESTERDAY.
CONGRESSMAN KING, WHAT DOES
THIS DO TO OUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH SOUTH KOREA AND CHINA?
>> I THINK IT SENDS A MESSAGE
TO CHINA THAT DONALD TRUMP,
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOT JUST
INTERESTED IN MAKING A DEAL FOR
THE SAKE OF A DEAL.
TO ME IT PUTS MORE PRESSURE ON
CHINA.
CHINA HAS A LOT TO SAY HERE
ABOUT NORTH KOREA'S CONDUCT AND
NOW I THINK THIS CAN PUT MORE
PRESSURE ON CHINA TO PRESSURE
NORTH KOREA TO COME TO THE
TABLE AND DO IT IN A REALISTIC
WAY.
CHINA CAN BE THE KEY HERE AND
SO THIS PUTS PRESSURE BACK ON
THEM AND IT SHOWS THEM THAT THE
PRESIDENT IS SERIOUS WHEN IT
COMES TO NEGOTIATIONS.
>> Sandra: I HAVE TO LEAVE IT
THERE.
DO YOU THINK THIS MEETING
HAPPENS?
>> I WOULD SAY NOT NOW BUT
STILL A GOOD CHANCE OF IT
