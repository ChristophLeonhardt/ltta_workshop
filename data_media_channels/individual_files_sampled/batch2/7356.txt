life okay guys so I read an article yesterday about drug prices and negotiating drug prices one of the things that Donald Trump had down the campaign which I thought was very smart politically was he said why is Medicare not negotiating prices with the drug companies it's a great question this question we've been asking a long time if they negotiate a drug prices we would have lower drug prices and Medicare is the largest buyer of drugs in the country so they would have enormous leverage it's insane that we forbid our government from representing us and negotiating drug prices with the drug companies it's because he bribed all the government officials by the way yes george w bush and yes barack obama I know Obama claims I had to do a compromise where I give them this monopoly power yeah yeah yeah you and all your compromises so with a smart strategy on Trump's part to say of course we should negotiate so here we are Donald Trump is president is he going to negotiate drug prices you know where this is gonna add of course not he was lying all along so they just released an executive order saying they're gonna increase the drug companies monopolies you know that we pay oftentimes three times as much as other countries do cuz their governments actually negotiate drug prices with companies our government says oh you're gonna bribe me with campaign donations and independent expenditures and we made that legal great then here we don't we were surrender on behalf of the American people we do a unilateral surrender so Donald Trump in his executive order is going to increase their monopolies and not negotiate prices with them he's the same old corrupt politician but honestly even worse he's a bigger liar so all of you guys who trusted him that he was going to do anything populist it's not remotely true so he's going to take the giant donors and give them everything they want and he proved it yet again on an incredibly important issue so yesterday we covered on the show one last thing about how he said he has on poor people in his government he says all like rich people rich people are going to negotiate better for us well you didn't negotiate at all now you like rich people because they give you those legal bribes and may perhaps in his case perhaps illegal ones anyway we'll see what what the investigations on that turn out but uh do you understand why he says that because he has sustained for all of us he thinks if you're poor or middle class you're a loser that's why he doesn't want your news government he wants winners and in his mind winners are billionaires and millionaires no matter how they got there so and he thinks well these drug companies they're all multibillion-dollar corporations they're winners so winners make winner deals together we all get rich and you losers pay the bill and a lot of you out there we're like a hooker yeah take my money Donald Bigler buddy well he did he took it and he betrayed you one more time that's it
