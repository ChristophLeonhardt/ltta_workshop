new coalition talks have kicked off in Germany in what is seen as Angela Merkel's last chance to form a majority government and avoid yet another election the Social Democrats and the ruling Christian Democratic Union will now have five days to enter into a so-called grand coalition and both sides seem fairly confident of success now forming the alliance with the Social Democrats is the only live option for angular Merkel after previous coalition talks of the Green Party and the Free Democrats collapsed two months ago the current political crisis is seen by some as the worst in Germany for years RT Zilla petrenko now sizes up Merkel's chances of resolving the situation to put together a coalition it takes a match angle has been desperate to make any match she hoped her party could match with the greens but that plan also required matching with the FDP or the Free Democrats a right swipe here too but no it's a match pop ups angle almost got it right with the Green Party but she's still in favor of using coal power plus her Transport Minister in the old government called the Greens tofu that has fallen into our meat stew when it comes to the FDP these folks were nowhere near matching with deep divisions in how to deal with tax solemn and environmental policies the event ones we will not abandon our voters for a policy with which we are not convinced it is better not to govern than to govern badly so that was it for the so called Jamaica coalition talks one guy quit using the coalition building app altogether but then signed up again we are not entering a grand coalition we said this clearly in this room after the elections and we still stand by this the new time needs a new politics and that's why these talks are necessary to meet the great challenges facing the world your in Germany so angle um crossed paths with her old partner swipe left or swipe right the conservative leader is having another go at matching with the Social Democrats but here again Angela may find herself matchless here's why migration was much less of an issue in 2013 when agreeing on the CD USB D grand coalition was no sweat today it's one of the main if not the number one issue for Germans to worry about the success of the right-wing forced the conservative bloc to get more tough on asylum seekers something the Social Democrats refused to accept instead what they'd love to accept and actually push for is more EU integration after all the SPD leader wants to see the United States of Europe and while Angela's CDU is more hesitant the Bavarian wing of her bloc is turning increasingly Euroskeptic you don't invite Hungary's leader / EU boogie man Viktor Orban to a party summit for nothing then there's the issue of how much to spend on the army the Conservatives are seeking more military spending to reach the NATO target of 2% of GDP the Social Democrats though say that's not what Germany needs if eventually these things are enough to cause a mismatch Angela Merkel may end up in real trouble and that's the prospect of yet another election looms recent opinion polls show that more than a half of all Germans are against Merkel as Chancellor earlier we spoke to Reina ruthless who says an election rerun could be much closer than many think the trust in the great coalition is beginning to diminish quite considerably in the German population there is already much majority of people calling for new elections as recent polls have shown a good New York negotiator would have seen much earlier that one of the three or four even negotiating parties was quite underrepresented and the different points that were gathered to form the coalition and obviously Angela Merkel failed in that point she did not realize how bad the situation was perceived on behalf of the Liberals I can imagine that Merkel will be replaced even if there are new elections already in 2018 and so amid the political uncertainty some are speculating that Merkel may not run again if the latest coalition talks fail the media has already lined up who it thinks could succeed her what is the dome for on the Reichstag Donald isn't well have any of you ever seen a circus for the flat roof your Christmas laptop goes in Cinci are you an expert in German wines and if we were to do a wine test now yes it's pretty easy to distinguish between bread and white one
