there's a super easy way to find your
phone using Google search here's how to
do it make sure you're signed into your
Google account registered to your phone
go to Google search where's my phone
this will open up a map with your
phone's location click the map to open
up additional options you can ring your
phone even if it's on silent lock your
phone and change the passcode or perform
a factory reset
unfortunately this only works for
Android users so iPhone users will have
to rely on iCloud
