I Andrew um thanks for coming tonight I believe I have the answer to your question why Hollywood thinks you're stupid let's see right it is because I am wearing camouflage more specifically I believe that they think that I am stupid people who look like me people who hunt who fish people who use firearms people who are different from them culturally people who are Christians like me people who they automatically assume are stupid several people in my family are farmers in different states in Oklahoma and in Iowa and throughout my life several times I have had people comment on the fact that members of my family are professional farmers and comment in a very derisive sense and that I find really amazing and I think that that is the answer to your question they really don't you know I lived I live in now in the Hollywood Hills my next-door neighbor when I moved in was one of the most famous women in Hollywood I'm not gonna tell you who it was but really really as top as it could be my house was down here she's kind of she trades houses so she was only there for a year but she was there for the first year I was there my house was here her house was there I stand out on the patio with a phone screen I would scream about Obama how much I agree I was at Obama I just could feel her up there you know like watching she is one of the biggest anti-gun campaigners in the country all day long men with guns walked in and out of that house to protect her they used to call they called me and said don't be afraid we're watching your house and I thought I'm glad you're watching my house why I got my own gun it never occurs to this woman one time that those of us who can't afford these bodyguards with guns need guns you know it just doesn't occur to it and it's almost a kind of they're like a kind of royalty they're so elevated above our lives that they really don't understand that you know you say they they think you're stupid I'm not sure they know you're alive and and I just think it's that's how detach they are
