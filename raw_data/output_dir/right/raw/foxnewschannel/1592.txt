1
00:00:03,049 --> 00:00:05,018
MAJORITY OF THE HOUSE.

2
00:00:05,018 --> 00:00:05,818
BRET.

3
00:00:05,818 --> 00:00:06,619
>> Bret: FASCINATING.

4
00:00:06,619 --> 00:00:07,820
PETER DOOCY ON THE HILL.

5
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:08,621
THANK YOU.

6
00:00:08,621 --> 00:00:09,689
LET'S GET MORE ON THE PROBLEMS

7
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:10,423
FOR HOUSE REPUBLICANS AND WHAT

8
00:00:10,423 --> 00:00:13,059
THEY ARE FACING HEAD OF THE

9
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:14,060
MIDTERMS.

10
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:14,661
SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST

11
00:00:14,661 --> 00:00:15,662
BRIT HUME JOINS US FROM

12
00:00:15,662 --> 00:00:16,062
WASHINGTON.

13
00:00:16,062 --> 00:00:17,063
GOOD EVENING.

14
00:00:17,063 --> 00:00:17,597
YOU HEARD THE STORY.

15
00:00:17,597 --> 00:00:19,399
IT'S KIND OF IN THE THEORETICAL

16
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:22,435
SENSE BUT WHAT ABOUT THIS

17
00:00:22,435 --> 00:00:24,270
FORCING RYAN TO GET OUT SO THEY

18
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,273
CAN GET DEMOCRATS TO VOTE FOR OR

19
00:00:27,273 --> 00:00:28,541
AGAINST PELOSI.

20
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:30,176
>> IT'S A CLEVER SOUNDING

21
00:00:30,176 --> 00:00:32,011
STRATAGEM THAT YOU HEAR ABOUT.

22
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:32,779
SET UP THIS VOTE EVEN THOUGH IT

23
00:00:32,779 --> 00:00:35,648
MAY OR MAY NOT PASS IN ORDER TO

24
00:00:35,648 --> 00:00:36,950
FORCE THE OTHER GUYS TO VOTE A

25
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:37,917
CERTAIN WAY THAT WOULD BE

26
00:00:37,917 --> 00:00:45,024
POLITICALLY DESCENDANT --

27
00:00:45,024 --> 00:00:45,692
POLITICALLY DISADVANTAGEOUS.

28
00:00:45,692 --> 00:00:46,392
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO

29
00:00:46,392 --> 00:00:47,126
FORCE-OUT A WELL-REGARDED AND

30
00:00:47,126 --> 00:00:48,661
POPULAR SPEAKER BEFORE HE'S

31
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:49,062
READY TO GO.

32
00:00:49,062 --> 00:00:50,830
I WOULD BE HESITANT TO BELIEVE

33
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,433
THAT WILL HAPPEN BUT AS WE GO

34
00:00:53,433 --> 00:00:55,835
FORWARD, THE QUESTION OF THE

35
00:00:55,835 --> 00:00:57,203
SPEAKERS INFLUENCE AS A LAME

36
00:00:57,203 --> 00:00:57,870
DUCK ISRAEL.

37
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,005
IF YOU ARE THE SPEAKER AND

38
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:02,041
YOU'RE TRYING TO RULE ROUND UP

39
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,343
VOTES AND THEY KNOW YOU'RE NOT

40
00:01:03,343 --> 00:01:04,843
GOING TO BE AROUND AND CAN'T

41
00:01:04,843 --> 00:01:06,646
PUNISH THEM IF THEY VOTE THE

42
00:01:06,646 --> 00:01:08,848
OTHER WAY, BECAUSE HE HAS THE

43
00:01:08,848 --> 00:01:10,016
POWER OF APPOINTMENT TO

44
00:01:10,016 --> 00:01:10,550
COMMITTEES.

45
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,453
IF HE'S LEAVING, THEY MIGHT NOTN

46
00:01:13,453 --> 00:01:13,786
IF HE'S LEAVING, THEY MIGHT NOTT

47
00:01:13,786 --> 00:01:17,824
SO EAGER TO GO ALONG.

48
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,491
THE PROBLEMS FACING HOUSE

49
00:01:18,491 --> 00:01:19,859
REPUBLICANS THIS TIME ARE NOT

50
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:21,761
REALLY WRAPPED UP IN THE PERSON

51
00:01:21,761 --> 00:01:22,629
WHO IS THE SPEAKER.

52
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:24,731
THEY ARE WRAPPED UP IN THE

53
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:26,766
POLITICAL GRAVITY OF A

54
00:01:26,766 --> 00:01:27,634
PRESIDENT'S FIRST MIDTERM AND

55
00:01:27,634 --> 00:01:29,902
THE ISSUES THAT CONFRONT THE

56
00:01:29,902 --> 00:01:30,803
COUNTRY.

57
00:01:30,803 --> 00:01:33,439
>> Bret: THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

58
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,807
CLASSIC PAUL RYAN TO SAY I NEED

59
00:01:34,807 --> 00:01:35,575
TO TELL MY CONSTITUENTS I'M NOT

60
00:01:35,575 --> 00:01:37,443
GOING TO BE AROUND INSTEAD OF

61
00:01:37,443 --> 00:01:38,211
WAITING UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION

62
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:40,413
TO DO THAT.

63
00:01:40,413 --> 00:01:41,948
TALK ABOUT THE PROBLEMS FACING

64
00:01:41,948 --> 00:01:43,449
THOSE REPUBLICANS.

65
00:01:43,449 --> 00:01:45,051
THEY'VE GOT THIS IMMIGRATION

66
00:01:45,051 --> 00:01:46,619
POTENTIAL VOTE WHICH IS ONE OF

67
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,054
THE REASONS THEY FARM BILL WENT

68
00:01:48,054 --> 00:01:48,354
DOWN.

69
00:01:48,354 --> 00:01:50,323
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

70
00:01:50,323 --> 00:01:53,426
IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING THAT THIS

71
00:01:53,426 --> 00:01:54,160
CAUCUS HAD SOME SERIOUS

72
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,963
DIVISIONS WITHIN IT.

73
00:01:56,963 --> 00:01:59,666
THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS.

74
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:00,400
BEFORE PAUL RYAN'S ANNOUNCEMENT

75
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,238
THAT HE WAS LEAVING.

76
00:02:05,238 --> 00:02:06,005
THE IMMIGRATION MEASURE WHICH IS

77
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:08,841
PROFOUNDLY CONTROVERSIAL ON

78
00:02:08,841 --> 00:02:11,444
WHICH A VOTE MAY BE FORCED IS A

79
00:02:11,444 --> 00:02:12,045
PROBLEM.

80
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:13,846
THE FATE OF THE FARM BILL, AS

81
00:02:13,846 --> 00:02:15,048
YOU MENTIONED OR AS PETER

82
00:02:15,048 --> 00:02:16,282
MENTIONED, IT'S A PROBLEM.

83
00:02:16,282 --> 00:02:18,651
THEY ARE GOING TO TO GET BACK TO

84
00:02:18,651 --> 00:02:21,287
IT AT SOME POINT.

85
00:02:21,287 --> 00:02:23,589
THESE ARE THE KINDS OF PROBLEMS

86
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:24,724
YOU DON'T PARTICULARLY WANT TO

87
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:27,026
HAVE AS YOU ARE HEADED INTO A

88
00:02:27,026 --> 00:02:27,827
MIDTERM ELECTION PARTICULARLY A

89
00:02:27,827 --> 00:02:29,062
MIDTERM ELECTION WHICH THE

90
00:02:29,062 --> 00:02:31,431
HISTORIC LAWS OF THE INCUMBENT

91
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:33,366
PRESIDENT'S PARTY IN A MIDTERM

92
00:02:33,366 --> 00:02:34,667
FIRST PRESIDENTS MIDTERM IS 24

93
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:35,868
SEATS.

94
00:02:35,868 --> 00:02:37,537
IF 24 SEATS FLIP THIS TIME,

95
00:02:37,537 --> 00:02:38,971
WHICH WOULD BE KIND OF NORMAL,

96
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:41,441
THE REPUBLICANS LOSE THE HOUSE.

97
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:43,009
YOU'VE GOT ALL THAT GOING

98
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:44,277
AGAINST YOU.

99
00:02:44,277 --> 00:02:46,379
YOU HAVE THE MOTIVATION PROVIDED

100
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,648
BY THE PERSONAL ANIMUS TOWARD

101
00:02:48,648 --> 00:02:50,216
TRUMP THAT SO MANY LIBERAL AND

102
00:02:50,216 --> 00:02:53,052
DEMOCRATIC VOTERS FEEL AND THAT

103
00:02:53,052 --> 00:02:54,687
LEADS TO A HIGH HILL TO CLIMB.

104
00:02:54,687 --> 00:02:55,922
THERE ARE SOME NUMBERS THAT MAKE

105
00:02:55,922 --> 00:02:58,424
IT LOOK BETTER, THE GENERIC

106
00:02:58,424 --> 00:03:00,126
BALLOT WHERE YOU ASK IF YOU

107
00:03:00,126 --> 00:03:01,894
WOULD RATHER VOTE FOR DEMOCRAT

108
00:03:01,894 --> 00:03:04,497
OR REPUBLICAN, UNNAMED.

109
00:03:04,497 --> 00:03:06,632
THAT USED TO BE, REPUBLICANS

110
00:03:06,632 --> 00:03:07,667
WERE 16 POINTS UNDERWATER.

111
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:08,935
IT HAS NARROWED A LOT.

112
00:03:08,935 --> 00:03:11,270
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.

113
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,004
PRESIDENT'S APPROVAL RATING HAS

114
00:03:12,004 --> 00:03:12,405
TICKED UP.

115
00:03:12,405 --> 00:03:15,842
IT IS STILL A HUGE CHALLENGE.

116
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:16,909
>> Bret: YEAH, AN UPHILL

117
00:03:16,909 --> 00:00:00,000
BATTLE FOR REPUBLICANS.
