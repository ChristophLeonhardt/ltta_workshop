I'm Keith Olbermann and this is the resistance yesterday we received a magnificent present a present so large so impressive so monumental as to boggle the mind and set the heart aflutter yes my friends we are well on our way to seeing the usurper Trump brought low to seeing the restoration of this Republic to seeing I think the greatest collapse of our lifetime because you see Special Counsel Robert Mueller has uncovered a scandal the likes of which make Watergate seem like child's play this evidence shows that Donald J Trump is more dangerous than Hitler more dangerous than Stalin more dangerous than that mobile pet spud somehow used the wrong shampoo on my cat fluffy leaving her less cuddly than usual and reducing me to a quivering ball of humanity lying prone in my home tears and urine now you may say that Mueller's indictment of Paul Manafort Trump's former campaign manager says nothing about Trump or his campaign but you do not have the depth of intellect that earned me entrance to the prestigious Cornell College of Agriculture and life sciences you do not have the nuance to understand that Mueller just put the final nail into Trump's political grave no one does no one did it ESPN no one did at MSNBC no one did it Fox sports nut no one did it espn2 no one did it Current TV it took me a lifetime to find the political geniuses at GQ but they understand me and love me as I deserve to be loved as I deserve to be loved Donald J Trump you sir are a liar you sir are a buffoon you sir are the kind of human being for whom decency means nothing and for whom the world is merely a whorehouse of refuse and trash that somehow turns me on and yet simultaneously repulses me suffice it to say Donald J Trump is on his way out to the big house to the slammer to the hoosegow to the calaboose to the pokey to sing-sing and Robert Mueller with my help and God's will will put him there if you wish to purchase my new book Keith is effing crazy this is not a joke go on over to Amazon now I know there some criticizing me for mocking Tommy Lehren I said the Tommy Lehren misused the flag and some look at my book cover and say well Keith you also misuse the flag I am

today we are going to be discussing the fallout from the amana ford indictment and from the george papadapolis capitalist in indictment and he actually made a plea bargain i'm gonna talk about whether Trump is gonna be tempted into firing Robert Mueller the special counsel I think that would be a very large mistake we're gonna get to all of that plus I want to talk a little bit at length about this insane ad that I mentioned yesterday from a Latino victory caucus in Virginia against Ed Gillespie the Republican candidate for Virginia governor but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over

calm promo code Bennigan's bull and branch calm promo code Ben okay so I actually want to star today with the ad that I talked briefly about yesterday from the Latino victory caucus in Virginia and for those who missed it I want to play it because this is I think the worst political ad I have ever seen in my life I mean I think this makes the Daisy ad the famous days yet from 1964 where LBJ essentially accused Barry Goldwater of wanting to get the United States Newt it makes that ad look like nothing I mean this is really an egregious ad so for those who can't see you're about to see a bunch of minority children who are who are running away from a truck that has on it a confederate flag they don't tread on me license plate and an Ed Gillespie bumper sticker because the truck is going to run them over because it's a white supremacist seeking to kill minority children so Latino kid stops and then he sees an asian kid and then both of them start running because here comes that truck again ed gillespie bumper sticker on it every racially diverse child in Virginia is on this block and here they've been running away from the from the truck and oh no they've run into a dead end the truck suddenly it's night and the headlights come up and all the kids wake up from their terrible dream is this what Donald Trump and Ed Gillespie meet and then it's a picture of the people of the parents watching the Charlottesville hate rally and says reject hate vote November reject hate vote November 7th and paid for a Latino victory fund it's not authorized by the candidate but obviously the candidate did not condemn it the reason that I'm playing this ad again is because it really does speak to the insanity that has now engulfed huge parts of the left you know the great conflicts in American history have largely been driven not just by political differences but by the feeling that those political differences are not are not where we are unable to overcome those political differences that we hate each other right there the actual hate in this ad is not from Ed Gillespie right the actual hate in this ad is from this Latino victory fund it's from the campaign for Ralph Northam who actually you know if he didn't give the go-ahead to the ad which would've been illegal he obviously hasn't condemned the ad and there was another mailer that actually went out from the northern campaign endorsed by the northern campaign linking again Ed Gillespie to what happened in Charlottesville Virginia it's really pretty horrific stuff when when I read Federalist one yesterday and I talked about how Alexander Hamilton had specifically cited the idea that in politics you have to assume the best intentions on the part of your opponent if you want to convince them we're no longer in the age of convincing we're now in the age of getting out your base and I think that that's a political truism I think that people missed that in 2012 but in 2016 I think people got that that it was all about getting out the base no more was it no one was trying to appeal to the median voter now it's just about getting out the people who already like you and the best way to get them out is to essentially say that your opponent is evil and horrible and nasty and terrible but if you do this too much if you rely on this tactic too much you actually end up telling Americans that the people that they live with in their same community are evil horrible nasty brutish people and if you do that it's very hard to put the country back together again because I can have conversations with people with whom I disagree I do it all the time for a living I do it all the time casually I live in LA I mean this stuff happens but I don't actually think the people I live with in LA and the individuals with whom I speak are nasty horrible people I think they may believe bad things that are bad but I don't believe they're nasty evil people this ad essentially suggests that people who disagree with you are nasty evil people again it falls into the intersectional politics you want you want an example of intersectional politics at its finest this is the example of intersectional politics at its finest right this idea that you're gonna have all of these various minority groups and they're all running away from the evil white majority that is chasing them down on streets it's it's really a horrific ad and that's not the only evidence that we have of that over the last 24 hours Elliot Hamilton reporter for Daily wire he got ahold of an email that was issued by a woman apparently named Madeline leader she is the head of data services for the technology department at the DNC and she wrote this letter she was trying to search people out for four jobs she said a bit more than just the messenger here but we in the technology department here at the DNC are looking to hire for the following positions and then she lists a bunch of positions then she says as you may have heard we are rebuilding the technology team into a robust well-oiled machine that can tackle all elections from the presidential down to dog catcher and school board what's more important is that we are focused on hiring and maintaining a staff of diverse voices and life experiences something that we desperately need if we hope to secure the future of our countries and they're not just trying to hire a data science lead or a full stack engineer or a product designer they're trying to hire a staff of diverse voices and life experiences because you know when your computer crashes what you really need is somebody coming in and explaining to you how they grew up poor in in an inner city that's that's really really important I know in my computer crashes the first thing I do when I call our IT guy is I say to him please tell me the story of your life and how you're diverse experiences have led you to the point where you can fix my mac no that's not how any of this works but that's how I'm the bad part here's what the email apparently says according madellaine leader again the data the the Democratic National Committee data service manager who gave in no comments daily wire when we asked her about it she said please let me know if you have any questions or concerns and feel free to for it on to your contacts I personally would prefer that you not forward to cisgender straight white males since they're already in the majority she says straight out in the email that she doesn't want this email forwarded to people who happen to be straight and white because they're already in the majority it's that same sort of intersectional logic that leads to the idea that we can gauge your value as a human being we can gauge your worthiness in the workplace by your color by your life experiences as opposed to by the quality of work you do or by the kind of activity in which you take place again the slander in that Latino victory ad the slander that everyone implies a confederate flag is trying to run down black children which is insane I mean they're legitimately hundreds of thousands of Americans we're not doing that and have Confederate flags the idea that everyone is voting for Ed Gillespie size with the charlottesville hate protesters the idea that anyone who has it don't tread on me on the front of their car that that person is trying to run down some poor Muslim child on the streets of Alexandria it's just insane but again it comes from the same intersectional place that this white majority is inevitably imbued with a nasty horrible racism that cannot be fixed and as long as we think that as long as the left keeps doing that they're gonna get pushback from the other side right that Trump was a symptom of this you want to know one of the reasons why Trump won one of the reasons why Trump won is because Americans got sick and tired of being told that they were the types of people who are trying to drive people down and Hillary's deplorable lines was the worst thing she could have said during that campaign because when she said deplorable she may have been referring to the all right but instead she paints it with a broad brush said half of all Trump supporters were members of the all right that of course was untrue well what this leads to is a is a an insane amount of doubt in our institutions because we no longer trust the institution's we no longer trust the people who staff our institutions now we look at the motivations of the people who staff our institutions and we say are these people well motivated or not or is everything a partisan battle and that's why I think what happens in the in the mana Ford indictment or the Papadopoulos situation all of that is gonna have bearing on how Trump thinks Trump is an oppositional thinker he tends to think that people are out to get him by nature and in many cases he is right right now I don't think that Muller actually has them in the crosshairs I'll explain why in a second I actually don't think the Mueller is is going to be able to make a case against President Trump I think the worst-case scenario for president Trump is this ends up looking a lot like a Ron contra or the guy at the top is basically wet off the hook and some underlings go go down but with all of that Trump could be convinced to fire Robert Mueller and really create a political firestorm for himself by people whispering into his ear that everyone is out to get him I'm gonna explain all of that in just a second plus what Tony Podesta and Hillary Clinton and everybody else have to do with this why is DC so darn corrupt I'll explain in just a second first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at the u.s. ECA so you would do whatever it takes to protect their family somebody try to break in your house in the middle of the night you go to your gun safe you take out your shotgun and if somebody tried to break in you would blow them away but owning a gun for protection should not be intimidating overwhelming or confusing even in light of the fact that one mistake could land you with a mountain of legal fees a lifetime behind bars bars are worse it's you're right tonig on its your right to use it properly that's why I work with the US ECA to give my listeners they're complete concealed carry and family defense Guide 100% free it is 164 pages of life-saving information you can't find anywhere else they'll help you understand confusing gun laws responsibly owned and store a gun particularly if you have small kids trained for real-life scenarios survive the murky waters of the legal system and a lot more go to defend my family now calm right now to begin your simple rewarding journey to concealed carry and home defense confidence and right now you'll also get the complete audio version and bonus home defense checklist 100% free go to defend my family now calm again let's defend my family now come for free instant access to fend my family now calm gives you the information that you need to protect and defend your family so to recap in very brief terms yesterday's news there are basically two big pieces of news first was Trump former campaign chair Paul Manafort was in charge of the campaign for something like five months Paul Manafort was indicted on 12 counts virtually all of them had nothing to do while all of them had nothing to do with Trump and the vast majority of them had nothing to do with even the period in which mana fort was working for Trump and the White House essentially said as much for Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying that yesterday but look today's announcement has nothing to do with the president has nothing to do with the president's campaign or campaign activity the real collusion scandal as we've said several times before has everything to do with the Clinton campaign Fusion GPS and Russia and she of course is is at least partially correct the idea the only scandal here is fusion GPS and Russia is not true okay the fact is that there is some other material to Donald Trump jr. letters the George papadopolis stuff that it's troubling so the Trump campaign in nature the Trump White House more specifically is doing what they're supposed to do right they're saying George papadopolis was a low-level staffer who had nothing to do with anything he's really not in charge of anything in the campaign and and so they're now minimizing his presence in the campaign just as they did with Carter Paige who's also a foreign policy adviser with connections to the Russians it was extremely limited it was a volunteer position and again no activity was ever done in an official capacity on behalf of the campaign and never been what about the outreach to these making the campaign officials to try to put together this you mean that the outreach that was repeatedly denied and we're not gonna take any action on that how can you describe Papadopoulos as having a limited role when there's a there's a photograph of mr. Papadopoulos sitting at a table with millions of people so okay and she's not wrong about this again the idea that Trump was sitting there trying to direct from the top George papadopolis seems kind of ridiculous here's the problem with regard to Papadopoulos so basically to recap Papadopoulos was making some sort of entrees to the professor right not the guy from Gilligan's Island a professor who is located in London who apparently had connections with the Russian government and was trying to fix up the Trump campaign with the Russians and Papadopoulos is trying to make this happen the Russians also told him they had access to thousands of Hillary emails or thousands of emails more specifically and they said also that they had dirt on Hillary Clinton Papadopoulos apparently tried to pass this up the chain and this was shut down it's now coming out that some of the people he talked to included Paul Manafort he was basically he was gonna be indicted on charges of lying to the FBI about the extent to which he had been working with the Trump campaign while he was making these connections and instead he pled guilty in order so that he could basically get out of it there's there's some rumors today the Papadopoulos may have been wearing the wire the federal government turned him and that the he was wearing a wire and in context of all the the other Trump officials we're gonna have to find that out but having read the Papadopoulos statement of the offense I can say with certainty that there is nothing in there that is significantly more damning for example then that Donald Trump jr. letters that Trump jr. released himself on Twitter where he basically said that he was willing to hear the Russians had about hurt on Hillary and again Huckabee Sanders and the rest of the Trump team they're not wrong to say that Hillary Clinton was willing to do the same thing in that fusion GPS dossier so in the end I don't think any of this really touches Trump I don't think this reaches all the way to the top Manta force lawyers is saying also there's no there's no evidence of collusion and he's right I mean the indictment doesn't contain any evidence of collusion between Manta fort and the Russians with regards of the campaign specifically there's no evidence that mr. Madoff or or the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government mr. Madoff or represented pro-european Union campaigns for the Ukrainian and in that he was seeking to further democracy and to help the Ukraine come closer to the United States and the EU okay so you know again I think there's a bit of a of a benevolent spin on what manna fort was doing but the evidence simply is not there Trump's own lawyer Rhett Jay Sekulow he's saying that Trump is not interested in firing Mueller the only thing that can damage Trump in my opinion here the only thing that will really hurt him is if he fires Mueller there are two things that Trump can do that will start a political firestorm in the midst of all of this one of them I think would be justifiable one I think would be unjustifiable the thing that he could do that would be justifiable is to tell his attorney general to open up a Special Counsel investigation into Hillary Clinton infusion GPS to see if there was actual collusion taking place now Eli Lake has a really good piece over a Bloomberg view and when she talks about the fact that because Hillary basically used lawyers as go-betweens and shows both plausible deniability as well as a chain of payment and it wasn't like a gift from the Russian government because of that there may not be any laws violated but certainly an investigation would be a worthwhile thing Trump could do that it would start a firestorm it look like he's trying to misdirect from the Mueller episode I'm not sure to be politically smart even though it revved his base up for sure on the other hand when he could do that could really hurt him his firing Mueller if he fires Mueller based on suspicion that Mueller is gonna do something it will look more like a cover-up than like a legitimate exercise of presidential power even though he does have the power as president of the United States to fire the special counsel the Independent Counsel law expired in the late 90s that was the law that allowed Kenneth Starr to basically operate free of being fired by President Clinton both parties said this is no good we can't have independent counsels who are running around willy-nilly doing whatever they want without being subject to being fired by either Congress or the executive branch so they let that law expire now special counsels can be fired by the president but if Trump would have fired the special counsel and if you were to do so on the basis that the special counsel was looking at his family finances for example which he said he doesn't want Mueller to do or if he were to fire Mueller on the basis that Mueller is is going too far into his investigations of Trump personally it would look like a coverup and it would create a not a constitutional crisis because it would be constitutional but would create a political crisis for Trump you create the appearance that he's firing Mueller in order to avoid being being convicted of something right now in order to be avoid being investigated or it protects his family members and there are people encouraging him to do this so Trump's lawyer Jay Sekulow is doing the right thing here he's saying I don't think Trump is gonna fire me learn he has no intention of doing so no I do know in fact yeah I saw a couple people talking about that this morning and and the answer to that is no the president has not is not interfering with the special counsel Mahler's position he's not firing the special counsel he said that before there's no the fact that I don't think that anybody is surprised that an indictment came down today or that there was this play because we expected this indictment I mean I think I've been on your broadcast talking about this a couple months back okay now all of that Lee says there is exactly correct John Kelly Trump's chief of staff he says the same thing he says let the indictments work let's see where the legal system works and let the system do what it's supposed to do all of the activities as I understand it that they were indicted for was long before they ever met Donald Trump or or had any association with the campaign but I think the reaction of the administration is let the legal justice system work everyone's innocent until resumed innocent and we'll see where it goes okay and that exactly would be the right thing to do right you should just let this thing roll out unfortunately I think that there are forces on the left and forces on the right that are basically trying to troll Trump into firing Mueller because once he fires Mueller then there is going to be an accusation that he fired him for the same reason that he's supposedly fired call me because was getting too close now as I said all along I think the real reason that Trump fired Comey is he wanted to Comey to come out publicly and exonerate Trump Comey wasn't willing to do that because Comey said if I exonerate you now and then you come under investigation later then I'm gonna have to say so and Trump didn't like that so he fired call me well the same thing could easily happen with Mueller where he goes to Mueller and says listen I want you to exonerate me and Mueller says well I can't yet and Trump says you're fired if that happens it will look like a cover-up of epic proportions and it will lead the Democrats not only to try and impeach him if they gain control of the house in 2018 but we'll put Republicans in a tough spot too these will look a lot more like the Saturday night massacre under Richard Nixon then it'll look like him just firing somebody who deserves to be fired as I say they're people on both right and left or trying to troll him into this Steve Bannon apparently is trying to troll Trump into firing Robert Mueller that's because Bannon has more balls than brains I'll explain that in just a second but first I want to say

right who are trying to tell Trump to fire Mueller and there are some folks on the left or trying to tell Trump to fire Mueller I think that some people on the right who are trying to tell Trump to fire Mueller are trying to get in good with Trump they understand the easiest way to earn Trump's respect and his good grace is to suggest a Trump that he has ultimate power right like Jafar at the end of of Aladdin the ultimate power in the universe itty-bitty living space the problem is that you know people like Bannon who are telling Trump obstruct Muller don't give him any documents try to stop him because he's out of control you do that it's gonna come out it's gonna look like you're trying to obstruct and then you have a political problem on your hands whereas you just say listen my doors are wide open I have nothing to hide it makes it very difficult for the left to claim that this Trump Russia collusion stuff is a reality folks on the left are desperately hoping against hope that Muller has the evidence to go against Trump but again I don't think he does you know Laura Ingraham said this last night she said that if Muller had anything on Trump he would hit with that first I think that that may or may not be true but I don't see based on the manna for indictment unless it's just an attempt to get manna for it to flip how this reflects on Trump I have always thought that if if there was any sort of collusion inside the Trump campaign it wasn't because Trump was sitting atop the campaign directing it is because trumpet said I wanted to be close to the Russians I liked Putin I hate Hillary and so some low-level staffer says okay he doesn't like he likes Putin he doesn't like Hillary what if we just go to Putin and help from take out Hillary it seems to me that this could very easily be a case of Henry the second well no one rid me of this meddlesome priest and and that would be the easiest answer here but that would not necessarily be the actually that that wouldn't actually be Trump directing this from above again I think both the right and the left though are trying to kind of push Trump into using that gun that's over the mantelpiece you know there's this old rule in drama it's a is a rule from check off the player I check off that when you put a gun over the mantelpiece in the first act it must be used by the end of the second act well the gun over the mantelpiece is firing Mueller and I have a feeling that Trump is going to be tempted to do it just because that's what Trump has been tempted again the only audacious movies made as president really is firing Comey which blew back on him which should be a good example not to do this leon panetta obviously a matter of left he says that more indictments are coming again democrats are gonna keep saying this and keep saying this hoping they can't rip trump into firing Mueller's that then they can go after him on that basis as opposed to the actual underlying supposed crime what these indictments may indicate is that as a result of it there will be other trails of evidence that will be followed by bob muller and i think there's probably a very good bet that additional indictments will be forthcoming and could involve members of both parties okay well I think that that last point is the really important one okay the person one of the people who who was basically called on the carpet or is going to be called on the carpet is Tony Podesta Tony Podesta is the brother of John Podesta very very close to the Clintons the Podesta group was founded by the Podesta brothers to lobbying group inside Washington DC they worked very closely with Paul Manafort in his sort of pro-ukrainian dealings from 2006 to 2014 and in doing so Podesta got himself into some hot water the same day that the man afford indictment came down Tony Podesta has now resigned from the Podesta group he's resigned because he's got to imagine that something is coming down the pike for him well this should tempt Trump to basically hold his fire because of people from both sides get indicted it's gonna look like what it is this is the swamp it's not gonna look like Trump it's gonna look like the swamp Trump's best move here is to hold his fire unfortunately Steve ban and being more balls than brains is telling him not to do that ban and apparently according to The Daily Beast spoke on the phone with Trump on Monday offered a message get yourself some new lawyers now listen I know Bannon pretty well I was on a phone call with him twice a day for an hour a day for an hour a call for two years so I know bannon's tendencies bannon's tendencies is always honey badger right honey badger that's honey badger that this is not a situation where the honey badger is going to be successful because the fact is the more you dig in here the more the Democrats actually have something to play with according to The Daily Beast the former White House chief strategist has grown increasingly concerned the president's legal team is falling down on the job proving too accommodating to Robert Mueller leaving trum venerable as former campaign aides are handed indictments in terms of Steve's thinking about how the president is handling this yeah he thinks the legal team was not prepared for what happened today there serving the president well a source close to Bannon said another confidant abandon believes Ty Cobb and John's out the top two attorneys on the president's legal team are quote asleep at the wheel apparently two sources inside and outside the White House with knowledge of a conversation between Trump and Bannon told The Daily Beast been advised from not to demote doubt in Cobb but to bring in new lawyers to work over them in the hopes that fresh blood would bring an order and ruthlessness to Trump's legal team that Bannon sees is desperately incompetent and doubt in Cobb have both said that they should cooperate with the Mueller investigation and and both cobb and Dowd have had their problems but the idea that you're gonna fix this by basically stonewalling is the biggest mistake that you can make stonewalling here again if Trump is really in a sense I think that stonewalling is probably the worst thing that he can do and and I'll give you an example of this right Tony Podesta steps down from the Podesta group and he is talked about by Tucker Carlson on Fox News well Venable which is a very very good national law firm they sent a letter to Tucker Carlson and they basically threatened Tucker Carlson to stop talking about this is it gonna help Tony Podesta to do this the answer is no here's Carlson talking about it we got a letter from Jeff Garin thir he's a lawyer with Venable LLP a big law firm here in DC the letter demands that this show quote immediately cease and desist disseminating false and misleading reports about mr. Podesta in the Podesta group it demands we retract and delete all our prior reporting in the Podesta group and warns that if we don't do this quote mr. Podesta may pursue legal action including for damages in order to fully protect his rights the letter doesn't stop there though it also warns us that we will face legal action under the Copyright Act merely for quoting from this letter publicly as we just did the most amusing line though is this one quote Paul Manafort did not work with the Podesta group in this representation of the European Center for a modern Ukraine that's what the lawyers letters pulled us apparently that lawyer hasn't read the Manafort indictment yet in paragraph 22 of that indictment we read this quote at the direction of Manafort and gates companies a and B engaged in extensive lobbying on Ukraine the indictment also says that the Podesta group and Mercury were selected personally by Paul Manafort to lobby on behalf of Ukrainian interests so stonewalling in other words is the worst thing that you can do here because if you stonewall it's just gonna lead to more information being disseminated like tucker carlson did correctly last night on his program so this is a mistake the way that Trump should play this the way that Trump should play this first of all let me just say this the person who is most in agreement with me on this is Alan Dershowitz the harvard law professor who i actually had at harvard law and he says that he doesn't think that new lords gonna quote unquote get Trump I think this is correct his indictment has everything to do with Trump they never would have indicted him for money laundering or tax evasion if he weren't somebody who they thought could turn on Trump could provide information and evidence if not Trump somebody higher up in the chain between Manta for and Trump this is dominoes you knock down the first domino that knocks down the second domino ultimately what Muller is aiming for is the big domino in the Oval Office I don't think they're gonna get him I don't think they have anything because collusion even if it were to be established isn't a crime that's correct as I've said before collusion is not in fact a crime you actually have to engage in conspiracy in order for you to achieve a crime none of that is real and so the best thing that Trump can do is sort of open his arms and say bring it at me you know come at me bro right that's that sort of the best thing he can do especially because as I'm about to explain the the Trump can actually turn this whole thing to its advantage I'm explain how Trump can turn this whole thing to his advantage but for that you're gonna have to subscribe to the podcast if you want to watch me talk about it

this to his advantage I think the way he can turn this to his advantage is by pointing out what he's always been pointing out which is the swamp now the problem is that the swamp also encompasses a lot of his lower downs and what Trump should do and this is what Trump Trump fans are gonna have to swallow hard here and accept a reality Donald Trump is not playing for tea-chest Donald Trump is not playing underwater mega mega mega upside down Hungry Hungry Hippos okay he's not doing any of those things Donald Trump even if you like him even if thing is well motivated man he is not a sophisticated player in this space okay the lie that who's gonna come in and clean everything up because he was just so sophisticated business player knew the ins and outs had bribed people all this it's just not true okay the most the best case you can make for president Trump if you are a Trump supporter right now is saying that Trump came in here and it turns out that even during his campaign the swamp was basically trying to infiltrate his campaign and trying to infect his campaign with swamp eNOS right manna fort was a Republican insider long before long before President Trump had ever been on the political horizon again I told you I was made aware of manna for being kind of a swamp creature back in like 2012-2013 and he was working deeply with the RNC at the time when he's close with the Bush's the idea that that manna fort was some sort of trump specific pick who was personally close to Trump is not true probably what happened is that people at the RNC said you know who you could use you could use Paul Manafort and he said okay sure Manta fort why not what he should be saying is listen all these people who are recommended to me by the RNC all these people who are recommended to me about the Republican insiders these are the people who are involved in the swamp you want to know how I know because look how manifold was working with Podesta right Podesta is a part of the swamp too these are all part of the swamp now the one thing about this that I like particularly is that it is true okay it is true that Washington DC is filled with swamp creatures now the reason the Washington DC however is filled with swamp creatures is not because we just elected the worst people invariably very often people we elect are good people the problem is that the swamp eats people because the swamp is in and of itself just a swamp of money can we say the swamp people think oh well look at all that corruption all these corrupt people if we just elected the right people then that would fix everything I'm a believer in the Milton Friedman line it's not about electing the right people it's about getting the wrong people to do the right thing and that means you have to minimize the power in Washington DC all of the swamp penis right and it does it engulfs both parties and involves people in both campaigns all of this is because Washington DC is so powerful because Washington DC has so much money in it because there are so many people who are seeking to take advantage of that wealth and power in Washington DC I'm gonna give you a list of names of people who have basically been implicated in all of this okay manna fort okay Hillary Clinton Tony Podesta Donald Trump jr. Christopher steel James Comey George papadopolis Jeff Sessions Rod Rosenstein right there's like everyone everyone has been implicated in something here that is not good and is swampy in some way and the reason for that is not because all these people are bad it's not because all these people are evil people it's not because they all have bad intent it's because the people who are drawn to Washington DC the people who are drawn to power tend to be the people who most want to take advantage of the money in power the only way to stop this swamp enos is to cut Washington DC down to the bone now I don't know that President Trump is willing to do that but if he were this would be the perfect time to say this the perfect time to say this would be right now you look at all this look at all this corruption you know manna Ford had no idea who the guy was he came in he ran my campaign for a while I really brought him on for delegate stuff which is probably true when I found out about all the Russia stuff then I fired him which is also true you know I'm not here to be participate in the swamp but I have to admit that being an ignoramus about this sort of stuff it was pretty easy to infiltrate my campaign and this is one of the problems that we need to solve by minimizing the power of Washington DC that would require Trump to say that he's made mistakes before it would require Trump fans to say that he's made mistakes before but it seems to me that's the best tactic and can actually be used as a positive for President Trump going forward okay time for some things I like things I hate and then we'll deconstruct the culture for a moment okay so things I like I've been doing books for parents because I was asked about it last week so this book is called the happiest baby on the block my Harvey Karp so yesterday I gave you sort of a guide to dealing with toddlers because I have a three and a half year old and you know disciplining toddlers a difficult thing this one is about how to get some sleep when you're a parent the happiest baby on the block is basically about very very small babies right newborns how do you come crying and help your newborn baby sleep longer it's become basically the the Holy Writ when it comes to combing newborn babies they call them the five SS and I won't get them all off the top of my head but its swaddling and shush Inge and swinging and this is what you do to a baby that won't stop crying carps theory is that there's no such thing as colic that the idea that there's a colicky baby who's just crying and crying and crying because don't stop crying he thinks that if you use these methods it comes the baby pretty quickly I've used it on both my children it definitely works checkout the happiest baby on the block by Harvey Karp there's also a little documentary that you can view online where Karp actually shows you how to do these techniques to get your baby to stop crying he can finally get some slaves to check that out okay other things that I like so this is pretty incredible Hillary Clinton was asked what she's gonna dress as for Halloween and she said she would quote go as the president really that's what she said she said that she would go as the president which led me to ask well why would she dress his Donald Trump that's weird first of all that would be a great that would be a great thing if Hillary Clinton were to dress his Donald Trump I don't think she's actually going to do it Hillary Clinton at this point has basically become Miss Havisham from Dickens she was jilted at the altar thirty years ago and now she still walks around learning or wedding dress and that's her shtick now so here she was doing that yesterday she was asked about these indictments and Hillary says well guys I have a great chapter on indictments in my book please buy my book please please keep me relevant I have a great chapter about Russia in here she's still trying to show her books here there's one thing she will never be in that of course as presidents of the United States what a charmer she is I can't believe she's not president okay other things that I like so Bryan Cranston it's very rare to run across actors who are not so eaten by the Hollywood machine that they don't feel the necessity to go out there and just rip Trump up and down every five minutes Bryan Cranston is one of these maybe it's because he's sort of late to the ball game right he was a comedic actor until he did Breaking Bad and now he's probably one of the most sought-after actors in Hollywood he came out and he said listen people who are rooting for Trump to fail essentially screw you guys say he said if you if you think that you know Trump should fail here here's what he said let me get the direct quote according to The Hollywood Reporter he said if he fails the country's in jeopardy it would be egotistical for anyone to say I hope he fails so that person oh hey fu why would you want that so you can be right I don't want him to fail I want to succeed I do I honestly do and if you got a good idea that helps the country oh man I'm gonna support you I don't care if you're a Republican I'm a Democrat or whatever I don't care a good idea is a good idea now this harkens back to right after Obama was elected and Rush Limbaugh said he wanted Obama to fail what he meant by that is he wanted Obama's policies to fail he wanted Obama to hidden want Obama's he didn't want bad outcomes for the country he wanted Obama to fail in implementing his policies but I think that Cranston's comments here go to something deeper which is people have a personal investment in Donald Trump personally failing and that's a problem I agree with him and good for Cranston for saying it okay time for a quick thing I hate okay so today is the thing I hate John Kelly the chief of staff has become more and more sort of openly political I think there's a mistake by John Kelly I think John Kelly I had the love and respect of a vast majority of Americans the chief of staff because of his military service is great career the fact that he's a gold star father and now it seems like he's getting more and more political and when he does so he's mirroring the Trump line on a lot of topics sometimes that's good and sometimes what he's doing is true but he's getting himself in trouble I'm not sure this is his best use to the President of the United States is going out there and speaking on things like removal of Confederate monuments now cuz I disagree with him about the Confederate monument removal but because his job is to act as a a shield for President Trump not to act as a sword for for Trump's rhetoric in any case he was on with Laura Ingraham last night launching her news show and here's what he had to say it shows you what how much of a lack of appreciation of history and what history is I would tell you that robert e lee was an honorable man he was a man that gave up gave up his country for his state which in 150 years ago was more important than country it was always loyalty to state first back in those days now where it's different today but the the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War and men and women of good faith on both sides made their stand where their conscience had them make their stand so people are basically ripping him up and down for that last comment about the Civil War that robert e lee was an honorable man that people made stands of conscience on both sides and they're trying to suggest that he's a racist because of this watch Ken Burns's documenting Ken Burns basically says a lot of these same things this wasn't until the last five to ten years sort of the way that the Civil War history was taught when I was in middle school this is where the Civil War was taught not just that it was about slavery but there were people who are arguing on behalf of states rights disconnected from slavery and didn't hold slaves and didn't even particularly like slavery this was this was sort of commonplace teaching that may be wrong right and maybe that the revisionist history is correct this was all about slavery that Lee was not an honorable guy that he was fighting on behalf of a treasonous cause and that the entire thing was it was about slavery from beginning to end that seems to me in many ways more historically accurate than the traditional way this has been taught but to suggest that Kelly's a racist because of this is to be ignorant of how the Civil War has largely been taught in American schools for the last hundred and fifty years and now again I think his last line there that the Civil War happened because failure to compromise I'm not sure how you compromised with slavery exactly obviously Lincoln tried actually Lincoln wanted to to try and cut some sort of deal Republicans had been trying to cut some sort of deal even though their abolitionists but that failed because the the South basically could not accept the results of the 1860 election okay time to deconstruct the culture a little bit so in deconstructing the culture what we like to do is we'd like to take a piece of culture that maybe you are listening to your kids are listening to your friends are listening to and talk about what exactly the message is in the culture this one is kind of subtle there's a very very catchy song out by a group called Portugal of the man I guess that it's the name of the group is based on some obscure thing about how they felt like more than one person so there one man and also a country but they picked Portugal at random and in case band names are basically come out the band names are basically just segments from a James Joyce novels like Finnegan's Wake they just pick a phrase and then that becomes the name of the band any case the song is called feel it still it's a very catchy song but there's something going on in the music video that if you didn't know about it you're not going to catch okay so what's weird about this this particular music video aside from the fact that it's a weird music video is the fact that they actually embedded Easter eggs throughout the music video so you'd have to watch it online but you can actually click in the middle of the music video and it puts out messages so the people who design it right the band actually said they wanted it to be a rallying cry for politics they said that they wanted this to be a song for the resistance so you can listen to it and not get that it's a song for the resistance right basically they're saying that you know you you feel the lyric is all about how they're supposedly apathetic but they can still feel the resistance of 66 and say I'm a rebel just for kicks now I've been feeling it since 1966 now the ideas they're still part of this Woodstock generation that's why the album is called Woodstock so the left has never gotten over this idea like it stop it right there actually if you go back to that particular freeze screen of the people making out in the car if you were to click on the freeze screen of the people making out in the car maybe an Easter egg actually pops up when you click on it and it's it's a direction to Planned Parenthood so that's an example there's also a direction to give money to the ACLU or to help refugees and so they've embedded all these political messages so right there's a sort of random shot of people making out in a car if you click on this then it gives you the direct contact information for the it gives you the direct contact information for Planned Parenthood so this is the way that that Hollywood sees it's making a difference and this is why when people in Hollywood say we're just out there to make money we're just appealing to the population no they feel the necessity to actually push a particular message and everybody's living this afterglow from the 1960s the 1960s happened literally 50 years ago now folks 50 years ago okay the 1960s ended 14 years before I was born it's been a long time and you've got all these young people who have this glorified version of what happened at Woodstock which is basically a bunch of hippies smoking dope and screwing each other in the mud and this is supposed to be some sort of great and glorious point in American history but now we're gonna revitalize that we're gonna we're gonna make all of that come back through our through our hip Ness you know I don't think that's the case and I think that this constant search for a cause is not good particularly when you don't even know what the causes are that you are talking about the song itself super catchy but you should always know what it is that you are watching and listening to or at least the messages that they are trying to portray I mean there's a more obvious one right you see a Hindu guy burning a copy of Infowars the idea being everyone on the right is an Infowars Alex Jones reader so I assume this guy is a Sikh in any case the embedded messages and a lot of these songs are a little bit are a little bit hard to spot but this one was very purposefully put in there the crew the creative director Jason again him Jason Krieger he said quote we love the idea of presenting the apathetic decadent rebel just for kicks from the song against a hidden message of resistance he says this is a real practical laundry list of ways you can get out there and fight injustice so just understand that the pop culture is trying to push a particular point of view the reason they're trying to hide it is because if you know they're trying to push a particular point of view they're not good at doing it Katy Perry pushing a particular point of view and I kissed a girl and I liked it is much more effective than Katy Perry onstage at the DNC speaking on behalf of Hillary Clinton okay we will be back here tomorrow with all of the latest breaking news i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show
