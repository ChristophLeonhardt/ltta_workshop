have you ever heard of a company saying yeah I'd like to pay 38 billion dollars more tax I've never heard of a company say I like make $38 more tax let alone 38 billion that's how good it is to be a company in America now but don't take it from me take it from Tim Cook Apple's CEO without these policy changes would you be able to announce today the creation of 20,000 new jobs no there clearly let me be clear there there are large parts of this that a result of the tax reform and there's large parts of this that we would have done in any situation so it sounds like president Trump's tax bill has been a huge windfall for Apple well we - there are two parts of tax bill right there's a corporate piece in an individual piece I do believe the corporate tax side will will result in job creation and a faster growing economy now politically Tim Cook is a left-wing activist who has another left-wing activist Al Gore on his corporate board but he's still honest enough to say it Donald Trump's tax cuts made this possible and Donald Trump's tax cuts are going to create jobs let me quote some more from the Wall Street Journal article just incredible movie that Apple said it would invest thirty billion dollars in capital spending in the US over five years that would create more than 20,000 jobs the total includes a new campus which initially will house technical support for customers and ten billion dollars towards data centers across the country it will also expand from 1 billion to 5 billion dollars a fund it established last year for investing in advanced manufacturing in the u.s. more than 20,000 jobs including advanced manufacturing I didn't even know that they did advanced manufacturing in America anymore and yeah those are not minimum-wage jobs advanced manufacturing that sounds like about the best kind of job in the world that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
