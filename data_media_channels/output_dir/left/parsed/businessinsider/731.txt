the President of the United States has
terminated the director of the FBI James
Comey the president informed Comey that
he's been terminated and removed from
office we know the FBI has been looking
into whether the Trump campaign colluded
with the Russians a very serious offense
were these investigations getting too
close to home for the president
I shall resign the presidency effective
at noon tomorrow
indeed there are comparisons this is a
remarkable moment it's not something to
take lightly
