hello I'm handsome seeker this is counting the cost on ages zero your weekly look at the world of business and economics in what's been a big week for global trade we'll look at how the u.s. is uh pending the rules of Commerce and if free trade really is worth fighting for I'm Wayne hey reporting from Vietnam where we look at how this country has in just a few decades emerged from economic isolation and how it stands to benefit from a new multilateral trade deal plus a look at the futuristic self-driving vehicles from this year's Geneva Motor Show now when the leader of the world's largest economy decides to take a more protectionist trade stance raising the price of some imports there's a domino effect even president Trump's watered down tariffs on steel and aluminium hurt America's allies and trading partners and economists are baffled on this week's show we'll look at why the United States under Trump is going down this road we'll ask if China and intellectual property is Trump's next target and if the world's largest economy start a trade war what does it all mean for you and me first off John Hendren at the White House a defiant Donald Trump fulfilled a promise that helped make him president the American steel aluminum industry has been ravaged by aggressive foreign trade practices it's really an assault on our country accusing China and other countries of dumping cheap steel on the US market in an attack on American industry he said punitive tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum many of the countries that treat us the worst on trade and on military are our allies as they like to call them so we just want fairness the controversial plan would take effect in 15 days exempting Canada and Mexico as they renegotiate the north american free trade deal with the US and reserving the right to change the terms for other countries with changing things among the steel workers that helped put Trump in the White House over his promises of protectionism they're going to bring sealed back Trump had his own protectors we're gonna spend over a hundred million dollars and our plan alone in Kentucky in Granite City Illinois hundreds of workers laid off when the u.s. steel plant closed two years ago we'll be going back to work but on Capitol Hill the plan was criticized as the first shot in a certain trade war I'm disappointed as what I should say because we just passed the tax bill and this kind of flies in the face of that Democratic senator dick durbin compared it to dropping a bomb on a flea a fellow Republican Senator Jeff Flake vowed a bill to reverse the tariffs in Canada the foreign minister faced questions about whether the deck was being stacked against her free trade negotiation team her answer was diplomatic we think a win-win-win outcome for all three countries is absolutely possible and at the negotiating table we are absolutely defending and standing up for the national interest at the European Union talk was much tougher defend it so we are now imposing tariffs on motorcycles harley-davidson on blue jeans Levi's on Bourbon we can also do stupid newly planned EU tariffs on those and other US products are designed to hit swing states in American elections Florida Ohio Pennsylvania that Trump's Republican Party will need to hold Congress in midterm elections later this year despite days of opposition Trump remained a man of steel on tariffs yes even if he needed a reminder to sign them well the European Union is the top trading partner of the United States in goods and it is the top US export market joining us now from London is Russell Jones economists and partner at Llewelyn consulting good to speak with you again so why is Trump doing this given that the Europeans have been warning for some time that they will retaliate it's a very good question my suspicion is that this is a increasingly desperate president who is in a rather chaotic state of mind at the moment searching out for policies that he can actually into practice which will appeal to his core domestic support and protectionism is one of those policies he doesn't actually need to have a great deal of support from Congress to put in place these initiatives and he sees himself as fulfilling some of the promises he made you in the election campaign but generally speaking I think it's it's a president who is searching out to demonstrate that he can actually deliver something of substance and how vulnerable is the US to European tariffs I think the real concern about this this whole process is that we see rounds of retaliation and encounter retaliation and so on I mean the tariffs which have been announced thus far are in themselves really relatively small beer especially now that the United States is is thinking of carving out certain exceptions for other countries such as Canada and Mexico in themselves they're not going to create a lot of damage to the global economy or to the European economy but the real concern is what follows subsequently and now that the United States has decided to go down this path whether it can stop whether the world can stop there are plenty of examples from history where trade wars rather than mr. as Mr Trumper suggested can be good things actually trade wars can be extremely bad extremely damaging for the world economy so really this I think is a misguided policy and if there is one thing that I've learned over the course of my career it is that bad policies tend to end with bad macroeconomic outcomes and you talk there about about going down this this road so in the in the future I mean are we witnessing a sea change in in how global trading rules are being used because Trump is using national security as a reason for this for example would this said a whirring precedent yes I think it would I mean that that mechanism is is itself very questionable but really if you look at what Trump is suggesting III think it's it's troubling on two levels first of all it is symbolic of the United States abandoning what has been a very multilateral a very liberal attitude towards trade over the post-war period so all the way back to 1945 it has been the multilateral lidget liberal hegemon in the global economy and by abandoning that role it leaves a vacuum and the question is how that vacuum will be filled I think the European Union would like to think that it can occupy that vacuum and it will retain many of those liberal and multilateral priorities but the danger is that it gets filled by other forces not least those in China where perhaps we can be less confident that the sort of trend that we've seen in international trade since 1945 is is sustained and on a second level it's it's bad policy simply because it's economically illiterate you know trade balances are determined by macroeconomic forces how much a country spends how much a country saves not by individual trade deals and the fact is that for many decades the United States has spent considerably more than it's saved that's why it has an external deficit and the sort of policies that Trump is pushing through in terms of tax cuts and deregulation will actually encourage that excessive expenditure to continue so there's a there's an incoherence an inconsistency with what the u.s. is trying to do in terms of domestic policy as well as this international angle so what would a transatlantic trade war look like then and who's gonna pay the bigger price consumers or manufacturers at the end of the day you know consumers will will suffer but so will will industry I mean protection is a recipe for inefficiency it's a recipe for Less competition it's a recipe for higher prices it's a recipe for lower productivity you know there aren't really very many things good which come out of it initially perhaps you can sustain economic activity in certain sectors I think that's what Trump is really trying to do he's trying to protect the steel industry for example and you can you can achieve that end but it's a very narrow end the broader picture which comes through over the longer term is that consumers and businesses everywhere will typically suffer considerable costs if this process is allowed to gather momentum Russell Jones thanks very much for being with us thank you for joining us now via Skype from Washington is Jacob Kierkegaard a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics thanks very much for being with us so your organization is involved in in talking up the benefits of the global trading system so tell us why free trade is worth fighting for well fundamentally is certainly correct the Peterson Institute believes in the economic potential of globalization we believe that you have free trade it leads to more investment it leads to more jobs in fact in some sectors it leads to higher productivity and ultimately higher living standards but what is and that is certainly worth fighting for but what we must never forget which we say consistently advocate as well which has unfortunately been forgotten here in the United States in the last number of decades is that when you do free-trade agreements there are going to be winners and losers from them that is the nature of efficiency enhancing measures but it is up to domestic policies to redistribute some of the gains the overall bigger pie from a free trade agreement making sure that parts of that additional wealth and economic benefit also flow towards those that lose from the free trade agreement that has been forgotten here in the United States it will be a pity if that wrong lesson from free trade agreements would be I sort of imitated around the world I should organizations like the WTO be more upfront about that that there are as you say winners and losers when it comes to free trade that it has led to - in a wage inequality and people losing out and so on should their meat be more acknowledgement and more attempts to deal with that you could say that this is something that you know trade specific WTO like organizations should advocate but quite frankly that would mean the WTO and others taking positions on purely domestic policy issues which I think would be resented in many countries ultimately it is in my opinion incumbent upon the political leaders that strike free trade agreements and the backers that they have that want these free trade agreements for obvious often selfish economic reasons to recognize that there are losers from this process as well and ensure that these losers are indeed compensated in some way so in my opinion should really first and foremost be part of the domestic political process of agreeing to a free trade agreement good to speak with you Jacob kirkegaard in Washington better now just as Donald Trump signed those trade tariffs in Chile the ink was still drying on a revamped trade deal the trans-pacific partnership will get rid of tariffs for 11 countries and connect economies worth 10 trillion dollars one of the biggest winners is expectedly vietnam the oldest porcelain factory in vietnam hasn't changed much since it was opened in 1960 back then it was operated by the communist government of the former north vietnam when the country was divided today its united under communist rule but the government has embraced capitalism like most state-owned enterprises this factory has been privatized and will soon move to a new purpose-built industrial park moving to a new factory will help us develop you can see all our machines are old so we'll invest in more modern production lines for more than 20 years Vietnam was torn apart by war it ended in 1975 with the North defeating the south which was backed by the United States communism emerged victorious but the leaders soon realized that their centralized economic system had to change economic reality was the best future the government embarked on a series of reforms to open the country up and allow market forces it now has one of the best performing economies in the world when Vietnam began reforming in 1986 its total trade was worth only 640 million dollars a year it was really only doing business with the likes of China and the former Soviet Union just over 30 years on as its economic borders have opened that figure has left to more than 420 billion dollars but some believe it could do even better and say the government must continue evolving to combat problems like rising inequality it's caused by corruption illegal payment an informal economy and Vietnam must try to reduce it and now that Nam must create new incentives to modernize its economy the process is ongoing and reforms like increasing efficiency and breaking down bureaucracy may be pushed along by trade deals like the trans-pacific partnership some may question the pace but certainly the direction of the reform is is is very welcome but some of that will need to be accelerated for for the domestic private sector to be able to grow more than it has been so far that's certainly the goal of this company which used to import its clay and export the finished products price fluctuations meant it eventually became a domestic supplier only TPP and a new modern factory may allow it to realize its goal of returning to the international market all right still to come on counting the cost I'm Cyril Kairos and we're at a recycling plant in Doha and I'll be telling you why the Gulf crisis has been I think businesses like this one turn a new page but first self-driving cars with no steering wheel its makers are hoping this is the future of transport just one of the new innovations on offer at the Geneva Auto Show this week I caught up with the CEO of AI Kona and began by asking him about the concept car he brought to this year's event today we are showing a car that is the After Tomorrow I mean at the next next future in the sense that the self-driving car represents the future of technology in the auto car industry we believe in the self-driving cars as the future because you can think of a car that through and hop you can call and come and pick you up at you are all membrane you to play golf or to work or whatever you want to look to go and you don't have to be involved in driving because the car is doing itself I want to ask you about China it has already become the world's biggest car market will China for example dominate Italy's electric car market in the next 10 years we have been we opened the office in Shanghai in 2011 and immediately we showed an electric car because we thought at the time that all the Western world was in deep crisis because of the financial crisis that you everybody remembers also the car industry was in deep crisis there were very few projects going on in Western Europe or in America and the trend of the car makers were to internalize the projects that they were doing that by themselves at the same time China was growing double-digit so we decided to go there we started with five persons today we are over 80 because as you know that market is by far the larger car market in the world last year the new cars that have been register were over 28 million and we believe that trend is going to continue now the Chinese government has been the first one to really believe in electric cars 44 reasons that my opinion at least first of all because they have the political power there is nobody in the Western world that can decide the decision power they have for example if the major of a major city in China decide that the taxi or the garbage collection of the posters delivery has to be electrical is going to be electrical nobody can make that kind of decision in the Western world second in order to finance this industry you need a lot of money and as you well know in the Western world we don't have that kind of money third reason is China is one of the largest were producer of lithium and lithium is the raw material for the production of lithium batteries and the fourth one is their the one they have to solve the real pollution problem in the big cities so they are the future of this industry as long as carry electric cars and self-driving cars are concerned they raise OGG audio thank you very much my pleasure thank you now a cautionary tale perhaps when it comes to the benefits of artificial intelligence it sounds like a scene from a science fiction film but news this week that Amazon's digital voice assistant Alexa has been laughing at its human owners the smart home device has been breaking into spontaneous fits of creepy robot laughter and it's got quite a few people stress down Amazon hasn't said how widespread the problem is but assures users they are fixing it now things are looking up for France's economy but a skills shortage could put the brakes on growth Natasha Butler reports in the French city of Kabul it's another busy day at this building material supplier business is booming for the samtcy group that has outlets across France to keep growing the company needs more staff but it's struggling to find skilled workers we have 5300 staff but too and 16 job vacancies we mainly need salespeople forklift drivers and tyler's it's really hard to find people who are specialized in areas such as woodwork so it's difficult for us to recruit staff with the skills we need the boss says that 20 years ago people joined young trained on the job and worked their way up but today that's rare because fewer people are attracted to industry we can't fill vacancies internally anymore so we must recruit externally but the skills we need are not always taught in training schools so there's a lot of available talent we train in-house but it's not enough France is experiencing its biggest economic growth in six years but nearly half of its manufacturing companies find it hard to recruit staff even though unemployment is high experts say the labor shortage could slow growth there is no clear impediment for growth in the next few months but the labor shortages can be a real drag for growth in the next few quarters the French government wants to fix the country's labor shortage and get more young people into work it's already reformed the labor law allowed the workplace to be more flexible and it wants to boost the number of training and apprenticeship schemes like this one teachers at this school near Paris hope the government's focus on training will improve the image of apprenticeships and create more opportunities when a young person arrives at a company with two years of training like this they are much more attractive and it's what companies want to learn as much as possible here then one day open my own company to what extent the government's reforms will ease the labor shortage won't be clear for a few years but investing in this generation can only help the economy in the future Natasha Butler for counting the cost Roman Missal France and finally the International Monetary Fund says the economic impact of a nine-month blockade on Qatar is easing its latest figures show the Gulf crisis has actually helped a country to become more self-reliant Zaara hayaat reports from Doha out of a crisis comes opportunity and for 23 year old Abdullah it's this a new machine to make egg cartons made from recycled paper it can produce as many as a hundred thousand of them a day meaning Abdullah will be able to meet a boom in local egg production since the blockade after the Gulf crisis we lost our all our main customers and because they are mainly from Saudi Arabia Bahrain and UAE but we never gave up on our business and we continued searching another new way to run our factory else away the owns the only paper recycling Factory in Qatar which has four times as many customers since the blockade started in June and the factory exports 80% of its recycled paper to the likes of China Sri Lanka and Amman and plans on expanding water is added to this and it turns into pulp it's been pressed and dried on this machine here the whole process takes 30 seconds to end up with recycled paper but the water used is also recycled which means that very little is wasted costs are reduced and the speed that it takes means the company can deliver it boosting orders since the blockade of this on time more than 3000 new businesses have opened in Qatar since the Gulf crisis spurred on by a sense of national pride and a need to rely less on imports the Emir of Qatar is keen to implement self sufficiency as soon as possible we didn't actually feel that the blockade except the high prices of of some some raw materials the challenges of the blockade are continuing but Qatar Development Bank says it has enough resources to support startups and entrepreneurs we take it from the idea stage up until access to funding and investment access to markets and how we can take them globally later on back in the paper recycling factory the owner says a lack of trees and card helps teach the younger generation the importance of recycling and how the Gulf crisis has helped him turn the wheel of fortune from one man's trash to another man's treasure and that is our show for this week remember you can get in touch with us by tweeting me at TASM seeker and use the hashtag a JCTC when you do or drop us an email
