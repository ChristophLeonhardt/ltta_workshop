-  Good evening Mr. Shapiro.
My name is Chanel
Powell, nice to meet you.
- You too!
- So I'm a liberal in
view, those are my views,
and while we have,
-  Well again, thank you for coming.
I appreciate when people
who disagree come.
- Well I appreciate you coming to
our campus and speaking with us.
So I came here essentially out of
support for YAF and I
also came here to listen
and learn from you,
from what you're saying.
I think it's important to see
opposite sides and discuss, right?
But my question to you is,
how do we essentially bridge the gap?
From two different points of view,
how are we able to meet in the middle
by listening, I mean essentially,
we want the same thing, we
want better for our country
and better for our people.
Everyone in this room is our people.
How do we take care of them?
How do we meet in the middle
and take care of them?
-  Well I mean I think that we
actually have to determine,
to be completely frank,
whether we do want the same things.
I think that sometimes
people on left and right
think they want the same
thing in vague terms,
like better country,
but we actually have to determine
what better country looks like.
So, do we want a country where there's
more freedom to rise
and fall economically?
Or do we want a country with more
enforced rigidity of income, for example.
That's an actual difference in goal.
Do we want a country where men and women
are free to pursue whatever lives
that they want,
encouraged to pursue
virtue at the same time?
Or do we see that encouragement
by social groups to virtue as a sort of
block and check on freedom.
There's certain areas where we have
to clarify exactly what we think
an ideal America looks like.
My ideal America is basically
John Stuart Mill's America.
You get to do whatever you want,
you wave your hand around
as much as you want
until you hit somebody in the face,
but that is also contingent on all of us
trying to act virtuously
toward our neighbor.
So I think that the great
genius of the founders,
that they were balancing the sort of
European enlightenment view of liberty
with a more traditionalist view
of what private citizenry looked like,
which was a duty-based private citizenry
of duty to your neighbor,
not based on what
government tells you to do.
I'm not sure that that's
what the ideal America
looks like necessarily for
a lot of folks on the left
who feel, perhaps, that individual rights
need to take a backseat
to collective solutions.
So for example, my ideal America
is not an America where the government
forces doctors to provide
care at a certain price.
Because I think that
a free market solution
is not just better for healthcare,
I think it's more moral.
I think that a consent-based society
is a more moral society in economics.
A lot of folks on the left say,
well consent-based society won't get us
to universal healthcare, right.
So these are serious conversations
and serious discussions.
I think the way that we
can have a conversation
is actually by sitting and defining terms.
So very few conversations begin with the
defining of the terms, they sort of start
with second order conversations.
So instead of saying what do you want
healthcare to look like in America,
what are your competing rights and values?
Instead we start with,
we all want the same thing
and therefore nationalize healthcare.
Or we all want the same thing
and therefore complete privatization.
We might not actually want the same thing.
So you might want to start
with that discussion first.
What do you want to see?
So what I would like to
see in some of these areas
is more individual freedom
and then social networks
outside of government
picking up the slack.
That's what my ideal America looks like.
For a lot of folks on the left,
they don't trust the social networks.
They think that the
government has to come in
and take care from the top-down.
These are fundamentally
different views of the country
and I'm not sure that they
are completely bridgeable.
We can have conversations about them,
but in the end I think the clarity
is sometimes preferable
to agreement in ambiguity.
-  Well I appreciate
your time, thank you.
- Thanks so much.
