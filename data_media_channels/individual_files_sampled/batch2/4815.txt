just pull it and I'll say that anytime you need me to thank you thank you my friend and thanks to at home for joining us this our pop quiz ready American history pop quiz who was the head of the Republican Party at the height of the Watergate crisis who was that of the Republican Party when Nixon resigned poppy Bush George HW Bush was the chairman of the Republican National Committee from early 1973 until just after Nixon resigns in the fall of 1974 and when he was head of the Republican Party in in the summer of 73 right after white house counsel John Dean started testifying about Nixon before the Senate Watergate committee when right after Dean had started basically spilling the beans on not only the crime but the cover-up and then Nixon enemies list and all the rest of it that summer July 1973 Republican National Committee Chairman George Bush set out on a listening tour he traveled to four states to assess the mood of the Republican Party when it came to Watergate how were the party faithful feeling about Watergate how was the party coping how was this playing outside Washington we know that he did this and we know what the results of that listening tour were because George Bush wrote this memo about it date July 2nd 1973 memorandum to general Alexander Haig Haig was White House chief of staff right from George Bush you see the initials there next to it G beat dear al I prepared the attached mood of the party memo for the president then he gives the bottom line quote we're in fair shape I expect when we get by those witnesses dragged in by Dean we'll be doing okay all best and then indeed there is this two-page memo that is attached and the Paige memo is addressed to both general Hague the chief of staff and to President Nixon himself it's listed as confidential but no action required here's what poppy Bush says quote I have just returned from a four state visit see attached schedule to show types of events with the exception of a meeting with students at the University of Washington the other meetings were party and press meetings the press questions he said were 95% about Watergate and it wasn't just the press with that fixation quote poppy Bush says the party people asked me almost exclusively about Watergate but he then goes on to describe his overall findings on his listening tour quote I would summarize the mood as follows a the press it describes them as skeptical and here keep in mind he's talking about the press that he has encountered on this four state listening tour outside the Beltway in these four states to which he has traveled he says the press out there in the country is quote more civil than Washington DC and New York press conferences for the most part willing to entertain the thesis that party is not the loser out of the scandal meaning that the Republican Party as a whole is not being tarnished too much by the Watergate scandal be George Bush then assesses the mood of the students with whom he met quote unwilling to accept at all my conviction that president is uninvolved in Watergate quote reasonable acceptance of the thesis that party should not suffer because of Watergate civilan attitude good questions and then finally he gives his assessment of the mood of the party people so this is the chairman of the Republican Party at the time 1973 talking about the base talking about how the Republican Party faithful out there in the country how they're feeling about this Washington scandal this Watergate scandal as John Dean is testifying and as the scandal is really starting to consume official Washington according to George Bush Republican Party Chairman the Sarah 73 in his assessment the party people quote party people have a quote almost unanimous desire to believe that the president is telling the truth abhorson the enemies list that john dean had testified about quote immense frustration about CRP that's the committee to re-elect the president better known now as creep he says quote all that money sitting there and its continued existence remember this memo was written in the summer of 1973 after the 72 election so Nixon had already been reelected at this point he's saying the party faithful are frustrated that the committee to reelect the president still exists with all that money sitting in it especially if it's gonna turn out to be a slush fund related to the Watergate scandal according to poppy Bush the Party People quote also filled the press is playing up Watergate too much he says the party people have quote unanimous distrust of John Dean but some uncertainty as to his testimony the party people quote generally want the President to hold a press conference or speak out they generally do not feel the president should appear before the Senate committee and then he gives his his summary quote so this is George Bush then head of the Republican Party right explaining he's got this personal conviction that the president was uninvolved in Watergate even if people don't believe him about that here was his conclusion for President Nixon and the White House chief of staff that summer in this confidential memo quote the party people needs shoring up they want to believe in the president they are hurt and embarrassed by Watergate they feel betrayed by Watergate but when told we will overcome based on the president's record and party's principles they react enthusiastically the party people need shoring up tonight after another difficult day in his own summer of escalating scandal the current President of the United States definitely set out to shore up the party people tonight the president is in Indiana holding what the White House described as a make America great again rally promoting support for a Republican candidate is trying to unseat Democratic Senator Joe Donnelly and Indian much like President Nixon in the summer of 1973 the whole country knows and the Republican Party itself knows that a crucial factor and how this is all going to work out for the President and for the party is the level of support and enthusiasm and trust that the president continues to inspire from the Republican base from the party people right to George Bush set out to survey in the summer 45 years ago and both with Nixon 45 years ago and with President Trump tonight everybody looking at this presidential scandal in a clear-eyed way knows that there's a connection between the amount of support the president can continue to count on from the party faithful there's a connection between that and the extent of his own legal jeopardy yes the President appears sort of proverbially bulletproof in terms of whether or not this scandal will dent his standing but the the members of the Republican base who love him the most but everybody knows from American history even from the history of this president that you can only take so much before even the party faithful start to wither a little bit in their support and confidence and trust in the President and that may end up being absolutely crucial as to his ultimate fate and to what happens to the fate of the president and his party together right and the president's legal jeopardy the extent of the president's legal troubles the extent to which he was drawn into the scandal personally in 1973 that wasn't yet clear for Nixon either right John Dean was just starting his testimony the Republican Party Chairman was still telling everybody he was absolutely convinced that Nixon had no personal involvement in the crime or the cover-up which he absolutely did there's that level of uncertainty today as well about how much the president is going to be personally implicated in the scandals that continue to surround him today the New York Times broke yet another story about this president's apparent personal involvement in the scandal that has started ensnaring his campaign aides and his business associates including those who are now flipping against him a la John Dean the president's personal lawyer Michael Cohen pled guilty last week to eight federal felony charges and in so doing in open court under oath the president's personal lawyer implicated the president himself in two of the felonies to which mr. Cohen pled guilty both of which were campaign finance charges both of those felonies involved a tabloid company called American media and its flagship publication the National Enquirer well today the New York Times reports that the president and Michael Cohen beyond the two hush money payments already implicated in Cohen's felony pleadings Times reports that Cohen and Trump also made an effort to buy up all of the dirt and information that the National Enquirer and its parent company had stockpiled on Donald Trump as a public figure dating all the way back to the 1980s you might remember the last week the Associated Press reported that the American media actually kept a physical safe a vault in which everybody knew they safeguarded all their sensitive information about celebrities and public figures that they had obtained but not yet published including information about Donald Trump well today's revelation from the New York Times is essentially that the president at least tried during the campaign to buy the contents of that safe again to hush money payments related to that company and paid out during the campaign have already resulted in felony charges for the president's personal lawyer felony charges in which the President himself has been named as a co-conspirator right president's lawyer has said under oath that the person who directed the commission of those felonies was the president the president's business is also apparently implicated in the commission of those felonies according to the criminal information filed in court alongside Michael Cohen's guilty plea if that part of this alleged criminal enterprise involving the president now also turns out to involve a greatly expanded universe of derogatory information about the president that the campaign may have been trafficking in or trying to buy for the purpose of influencing the election well who knows where that is going to go but when when things came to an end in the Watergate scandal it was because of a Supreme Court ruling a unanimous ruling from the United States Supreme Court which ordered the president to comply with a court or subpoena that to turn over the White House tapes that's what resulted in the the public release of those White House tapes it was the public release of those tapes which really broke the dam in terms of Republican support for Nixon realizing that he would likely be impeached and removed from office including by many votes from members of his own party in Congress President Nixon then resigned that case at the Supreme Court that led to that outcome is legendary because it had such profound consequences but as a matter of law that Supreme Court ruling is not seen as controversial right it was a unanimous ruling for one including from judges who've been appointed by President Nixon since Watergate that ruling has come to be seen as a bedrock part of modern jurisprudence that proves that in America even US presidents can't break the law or defy the law with impunity there's a lot of Supreme Court rulings that are very well-known because they're the source of controversy u.s. v Nixon is very well known but it's not because it's the source of controversy it's not a controversial ruling that said president Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh has very unusually suggested publicly that quote maybe US v Nixon was wrongly decided and now today Democrats in the Senate have announced that one of the witnesses they will call to testify next week at the confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh will be Richard Nixon's old white house counsel John Dean who came clean with the Senate Watergate committee and told them all about the crime and all about the cover-up and that ultimately resulted in the dominoes starting to fall that resulted in the end of that presidency John Dean's gonna testify against Brett Kavanaugh specifically we expect on the issue of executive power and Cavanaugh to writing the result of us vs. Nixon I mean if this White House right now is at all trying to swim its way out at the comparison of this president scandals and Watergate and indeed the unfavorable comparison of this White House to the Nixon White House in the Watergate era it turns out they're swimming against very very strong very fast historical currents here so we're gonna we're gonna have more coverage on that tonight including we'll have an interview tonight with the Porter who first broke the news about the National Enquirer and it's safe full of compromising information including on the president hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
