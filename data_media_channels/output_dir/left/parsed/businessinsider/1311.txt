first of all we live in a country that
respects free speech and he spent so
much time screaming at this protester
and frankly it was a disgrace
he was talking to the protesters
screaming at him really screaming at him
by the way if I spoke the way Obama
spoke to that protest they would say he
became on here keeping him
you have to go back and look and study
and see what happened they never moved
the camera and he spent so much time
screaming at this protester and frankly
it was a disgrace
hold up hold up hold up first of all we
live in a country that respects free
speech
second of all it looks like maybe he
might have served in our military and we
got to respect that
third of all he was elderly and we got
to respect our elders and fourth of all
don't boo
