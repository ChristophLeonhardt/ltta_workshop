00:00:15,578 --> 00:00:18,014
>> Laura: HUNDREDS OF ILLEGAL

2
00:00:18,014 --> 00:00:18,915
IMMIGRANTS ARE PREPARING TO

3
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:20,450
CROSS INTO CALIFORNIA AND ASK

4
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:21,918
FOR POLITICAL ASYLUM.

5
00:00:21,918 --> 00:00:24,120
WHAT IS MORE OUTRAGEOUS, THIS

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,688
CARAVAN OF CENTRAL AMERICANS HAS

7
00:00:25,688 --> 00:00:27,757
BEEN ORGANIZED, AIDED AN ABETTED

8
00:00:27,757 --> 00:00:33,630
AND COACHED BY U.S.-BASED

9
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,165
ACTIVISTS FROM A GROUP.

10
00:00:36,165 --> 00:00:38,901
WHY HAS MEDIA TURNED A BLIND EYE

11
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:41,170
TO THE ROLE PLAYED BY THE

12
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,974
PROJECT'S COORDINATOR, ALEX

13
00:00:44,974 --> 00:00:46,676
MENSING WHO IS FROM THE

14
00:00:46,676 --> 00:00:47,677
UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO'S

15
00:00:47,677 --> 00:00:50,013
IMMIGRATION CLINIC?

16
00:00:50,013 --> 00:00:51,781
LET'S GET INTO THAT WITH DAN

17
00:00:51,781 --> 00:00:54,917
STEIN IN TAMPA AND FRANCISCO

18
00:00:54,917 --> 00:00:56,185
HERNANDEZ IN FORT WORTH, TEXAS.

19
00:00:56,185 --> 00:00:59,255
DAN, LET'S START WITH YOU HERE.

20
00:00:59,255 --> 00:01:02,058
THIS IS QUITE SOMETHING.

21
00:01:02,058 --> 00:01:05,828
WE HAVE AMERICAN NGOs AND OTHER

22
00:01:05,828 --> 00:01:07,697
NGOs WORKING TO GET THE

23
00:01:07,697 --> 00:01:09,332
PUBLICITY GOING FOR THIS GROUP.

24
00:01:09,332 --> 00:01:10,633
THEY COME EVERY YEAR ABOUT

25
00:01:10,633 --> 00:01:11,901
EASTER TIME AND MAKE THEIR WAY

26
00:01:11,901 --> 00:01:12,969
TO MEXICO.

27
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:15,305
MEXICO USUALLY DISBANDS THEM

28
00:01:15,305 --> 00:01:15,838
EFFECTIVELY.

29
00:01:15,838 --> 00:01:17,373
THEY STARTED TO DISBAND THEM

30
00:01:17,373 --> 00:01:18,574
BEFORE I THINK THE PRESIDENT

31
00:01:18,574 --> 00:01:19,976
STARTED TWEETING ABOUT IT A

32
00:01:19,976 --> 00:01:20,743
COUPLE WEEKS AGO.

33
00:01:20,743 --> 00:01:22,879
BUT YOU HAVE THESE LAWYERS THAT

34
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:25,415
BASICALLY EMBED WITH THE GROUP

35
00:01:25,415 --> 00:01:26,382
WHO ARE AMERICAN LAWYERS.

36
00:01:26,382 --> 00:01:28,017
THEY'RE GOING OVER, OKAY, THIS

37
00:01:28,017 --> 00:01:30,219
IS WHAT YOU SAY FOR CREDIBLE

38
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:31,521
FEAR OF PERSECUTION AND THEN

39
00:01:31,521 --> 00:01:33,956
THEY SHOW UP ON BUSES AND THEN

40
00:01:33,956 --> 00:01:37,193
THEY ALL START RECITING THE SAME

41
00:01:37,193 --> 00:01:37,560
LINE.

42
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,997
IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S ENCOURAGING

43
00:01:40,997 --> 00:01:43,866
PEOPLE TO GAIN THE SYSTEM.

44
00:01:43,866 --> 00:01:46,436
>> LAURA, IT'S AIDING AND

45
00:01:46,436 --> 00:01:48,004
ABETTING AND ORGANIZED

46
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:48,371
SMUGGLING.

47
00:01:48,371 --> 00:01:49,972
THE MEDIA SAYS IT'S LIKE A

48
00:01:49,972 --> 00:01:52,442
STREET FAIR, THEY'RE COMING IN

49
00:01:52,442 --> 00:01:55,078
FOR A FESTIVAL AND GOING BACK TO

50
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:55,445
HONDURAS.

51
00:01:55,445 --> 00:01:57,480
THIS IS ORGANIZED SMUGGLING.

52
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,815
AS LONG AS THE UNITED STATES IS

53
00:01:58,815 --> 00:02:00,650
A FREE CAPITALIST AND OPEN

54
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,818
SOCIETY, THERE WILL BE MILLIONS

55
00:02:01,818 --> 00:02:03,553
OF PEOPLE THAT WANT TO COME

56
00:02:03,553 --> 00:02:03,853
HERE.

57
00:02:03,853 --> 00:02:05,822
NOT EVERYBODY CAN COME AND A

58
00:02:05,822 --> 00:02:07,857
SOVEREIGN NATION LIKE THE U.S.

59
00:02:07,857 --> 00:02:09,258
HAS A RIGHT TO CONTROL WHO COMES

60
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:11,026
IN AND WHO DOESN'T.

61
00:02:11,026 --> 00:02:12,195
GROUPS LIKE PEOPLE WITHOUT

62
00:02:12,195 --> 00:02:13,663
BORDERS DO NOT SUBSCRIBE TO THAT

63
00:02:13,663 --> 00:02:14,063
IDEA.

64
00:02:14,063 --> 00:02:16,799
SO THIS EFFORT IS PART OF AN

65
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:18,034
ORGANIZED EFFORT WE SEE ACROSS

66
00:02:18,034 --> 00:02:18,735
THE WORLD.

67
00:02:18,735 --> 00:02:20,636
WE SEE IT IN EUROPE AND THE GAZA

68
00:02:20,636 --> 00:02:22,071
WITH ISRAEL AND ALL AROUND THE

69
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:23,506
WORLD TO TRY TO CHALLENGE

70
00:02:23,506 --> 00:02:25,141
WESTERN SOCIETIES TO PREVENT

71
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:26,976
THEM FROM USING THEIR

72
00:02:26,976 --> 00:02:31,881
IMMIGRATION LAWS TO STOP THIS

73
00:02:31,881 --> 00:02:36,819
ORGANIZED SMUGGLING UNDER THE

74
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:37,286
BAN OF ASYLUM.

75
00:02:37,286 --> 00:02:39,889
I FEEL SORRY FOR THE PEOPLE.

76
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:41,591
IF ONLY REFUGEES CAN GET IN.

77
00:02:41,591 --> 00:02:43,359
EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE CALLED A

78
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:43,693
REFUGEE.

79
00:02:43,693 --> 00:02:44,660
SO THEY GET COACHED IN.

80
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,462
THEY KNOW IF THEY MAKE A

81
00:02:46,462 --> 00:02:47,897
CREDIBLE FEAR CLAIM, IF THERE'S

82
00:02:47,897 --> 00:02:50,099
NO DETENTION SPACE, THEY'LL BE

83
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:52,101
RELEASED FOR YEARS BEFORE THEY

84
00:02:52,101 --> 00:02:53,703
GET THEIR HEARING AND LUCKILY

85
00:02:53,703 --> 00:02:54,937
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS

86
00:02:54,937 --> 00:02:58,641
TAKING STEPS TO STOP THIS BY

87
00:02:58,641 --> 00:03:00,543
DEPLOYING IMMIGRATION JUDGES TO

88
00:03:00,543 --> 00:03:01,978
EXTRADITE THEIR REMOVAL.

89
00:03:01,978 --> 00:03:06,582
>> FRANCISCO, MEXICO HAS TRIED

90
00:03:06,582 --> 00:03:08,918
TO HELP OUT HERE AT VARIOUS

91
00:03:08,918 --> 00:03:10,920
POINTS INCLUDING BY, YOU KNOW,

92
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,489
TELLING THE FOLKS, LOOK, YOU

93
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:15,792
HAVE 30 DAYS TO LEAVE MEXICO.

94
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:18,060
WE'LL GIVE YOU A TRANSIT VISA

95
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,862
AND YOU HAVE TO LEAVE MEXICO.

96
00:03:19,862 --> 00:03:21,497
THEIR POINT IS, MEXICAN

97
00:03:21,497 --> 00:03:23,499
OFFICIALS HAVE SAID IF YOU WANT

98
00:03:23,499 --> 00:03:25,535
ASYLUM, WE'LL GIVE YOU ASYLUM.

99
00:03:25,535 --> 00:03:27,203
BUT THEY HAVE MADE IT CLEAR IN

100
00:03:27,203 --> 00:03:28,538
VARIOUS SOURCES HAVE TOLD ME

101
00:03:28,538 --> 00:03:30,540
THAT THE HONDURANS

102
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,141
OVERWHELMINGLY DON'T WANT TO BE

103
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:33,042
IN MEXICO.

104
00:03:33,042 --> 00:03:35,278
SO THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED IN

105
00:03:35,278 --> 00:03:37,447
GOING TO ANY COUNTRY EXCEPT OUR

106
00:03:37,447 --> 00:03:37,780
COUNTRY.

107
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,414
WHY IS THAT?

108
00:03:38,414 --> 00:03:40,683
>> EXCEPT THE PROMISED LAND.

109
00:03:40,683 --> 00:03:42,652
LISTEN TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

110
00:03:42,652 --> 00:03:44,987
ARE WE NOW AGAINST LEGAL

111
00:03:44,987 --> 00:03:45,588
IMMIGRATION?

112
00:03:45,588 --> 00:03:47,223
ASYLUM LAW IS A LEGAL PROCESS BY

113
00:03:47,223 --> 00:03:48,758
WHICH THESE FOLKS CAN APPLIED TO

114
00:03:48,758 --> 00:03:49,325
COME IN.

115
00:03:49,325 --> 00:03:52,061
THEY EITHER HAVE PROOF OR THEY

116
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:52,628
DON'T.

117
00:03:52,628 --> 00:03:53,496
YOU CAN'T COACH PROOF.

118
00:03:53,496 --> 00:03:54,897
WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO COME IN

119
00:03:54,897 --> 00:03:56,199
UNDER A LEGAL PROCESS.

120
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,333
THAT IS OUR LAW.

121
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,268
THEY'RE NOT COMING ACROSS.

122
00:03:59,268 --> 00:04:01,571
THERE'S NO SMUGGLING, NO ILLEGAL

123
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:02,772
ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATES.

124
00:04:02,772 --> 00:04:05,541
THEY'RE A PLAYING TO COME INTO

125
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,559
THE UNITED STATES

126
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:07,877
THE UNITED STATE

127
00:04:07,877 --> 00:04:08,878
THE UNITED STATES LEGALLY.

128
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:10,213
ISN'T THAT WHAT WE WANTED?

129
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:12,982
IF THERE'S 400 AT THE BORDER,

130
00:04:12,982 --> 00:04:14,617
BRING THEM SOME BRICKS AND THEY

131
00:04:14,617 --> 00:04:15,718
CAN BUILD THE WALL.

132
00:04:15,718 --> 00:04:19,021
>> SINCE WE SPENT $16 BILLION

133
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:21,557
ALL TOLD ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION,

134
00:04:21,557 --> 00:04:22,859
THAT WOULD BE FIVE WALLS.

135
00:04:22,859 --> 00:04:24,126
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT LEGAL

136
00:04:24,126 --> 00:04:24,527
IMMIGRATION.

137
00:04:24,527 --> 00:04:26,262
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE

138
00:04:26,262 --> 00:04:28,231
THAT COME HERE ILLEGALLY IN THE

139
00:04:28,231 --> 00:04:28,698
UNITED STATES.

140
00:04:28,698 --> 00:04:29,799
MANY OF THE PEOPLE INTERVIEWED

141
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:30,700
HAVE SAID --

142
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,367
>> NO.

143
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:32,101
>> Laura: HOLD ON.

144
00:04:32,101 --> 00:04:33,202
THEY HAVE DISBANDED FROM THE

145
00:04:33,202 --> 00:04:34,670
GROUP AND SAY WE'RE GOING TO GET

146
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:34,971
THERE.

147
00:04:34,971 --> 00:04:38,441
WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE IF WE

148
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:44,780
DON'T GET IN AS ASSILEES --

149
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,315
>> WHAT ABOUT LEGAL IMMIGRATION?

150
00:04:46,315 --> 00:04:48,885
THEY'RE INVOKING ASYLUM LAWS

151
00:04:48,885 --> 00:04:50,887
THAT IS THE LAW OF THE LAND.

152
00:04:50,887 --> 00:04:52,255
>> Laura: FRANCISCO, ARE YOU

153
00:04:52,255 --> 00:04:53,256
SAYING YOU DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S

154
00:04:53,256 --> 00:04:56,158
FRAUD IN THE ASYLUM --

155
00:04:56,158 --> 00:04:59,328
APPLICATION OF THE ASYLUM LAWS?

156
00:04:59,328 --> 00:05:00,563
>> SURE THERE IS.

157
00:05:00,563 --> 00:05:01,597
>> Laura: IT'S RAMPANT.

158
00:05:01,597 --> 00:05:04,700
>> AND IMMIGRATION IS VERY GOOD

159
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,870
AT FERRETING IT OUT.

160
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,673
THE PROOF IS --

161
00:05:10,673 --> 00:05:13,943
>> Laura: WHAT IS -- FRANCISCO,

162
00:05:13,943 --> 00:05:15,611
YOU'RE AN IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY.

163
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:18,281
YOU THINK THESE -- YOU THINK

164
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:21,183
THAT 24-YEAR-OLD MOTHER OF THREE

165
00:05:21,183 --> 00:05:23,519
IS PUTTING ON WITNESSES AND --

166
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,654
HERE'S MY DOCUMENTS.

167
00:05:24,654 --> 00:05:26,122
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY DOCUMENTS

168
00:05:26,122 --> 00:05:28,124
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

169
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:29,425
>> MRS. INGRAM --

170
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:30,893
>> Laura: CALL ME LAURA.

171
00:05:30,893 --> 00:05:33,396
>> THE U.S. AGENTS -- THE TRUMP

172
00:05:33,396 --> 00:05:34,864
ADMINISTRATION'S AGENTS ARE

173
00:05:34,864 --> 00:05:35,565
GROWING TO DETERMINE WHETHER

174
00:05:35,565 --> 00:05:37,567
THESE PEOPLE CAN PROVE IMMEDIATE

175
00:05:37,567 --> 00:05:37,967
FEAR.

176
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:39,702
IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S ALL THESE

177
00:05:39,702 --> 00:05:41,270
SOCIAL PROGRAMS GOING OUT.

178
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,673
IT'S A HARD THRESHOLD TO PROVE.

179
00:05:43,673 --> 00:05:45,308
IT'S A LEGAL WAY OF INVOKING THE

180
00:05:45,308 --> 00:05:46,309
LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES.

181
00:05:46,309 --> 00:05:48,444
>> Laura: I THINK IT'S 75 TO 93%

182
00:05:48,444 --> 00:05:51,881
OF PEOPLE THAT APPLY FOR ASYLUM

183
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:53,883
IN THIS PROCESS GET IT OR

184
00:05:53,883 --> 00:05:56,285
ULTIMATELY GET RELEASED ANYWAY

185
00:05:56,285 --> 00:05:57,420
DURING THE PROCESS --

186
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,622
>> NO, LESS THAN 10%.

187
00:05:59,622 --> 00:06:01,324
>> Laura: THEY GET RELEASED

188
00:06:01,324 --> 00:06:05,161
INTO -- DAN, DO THEY NOT GET

189
00:06:05,161 --> 00:06:08,164
RELEASED AFTER THEY APPLIED --

190
00:06:08,164 --> 00:06:10,600
>> THE FIRST IS WHAT IS CALL

191
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,734
CREDIBLE FEAR.

192
00:06:11,734 --> 00:06:13,202
IT'S A LOW THRESHOLD.

193
00:06:13,202 --> 00:06:16,105
ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY IS I'M

194
00:06:16,105 --> 00:06:17,607
AFRAID TO GO HOME.

195
00:06:17,607 --> 00:06:19,609
THEY CAN REQUEST A JUDGE.

196
00:06:19,609 --> 00:06:21,644
THE PROBLEM IS THEY GET BACK

197
00:06:21,644 --> 00:06:23,379
LOCKED AND RELEASED TO SOCIETY

198
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:26,682
AND HERE FOR YEARS.

199
00:06:26,682 --> 00:06:29,485
I WISH HAD A DOLLAR FOR EVERY

200
00:06:29,485 --> 00:06:31,721
TIME THEY DON'T SHOW UP FOR

201
00:06:31,721 --> 00:06:34,056
THEIR HEARING OR DEPORTATION --

202
00:06:34,056 --> 00:06:35,524
IT GOES ON AND ON.

203
00:06:35,524 --> 00:06:36,525
>> OKAY --

204
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:39,095
>> Laura: HOLD ON A SECOND.

205
00:06:39,095 --> 00:06:40,763
>> THERE IS A MASSIVE MESS.

206
00:06:40,763 --> 00:06:42,999
>> IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, FIX THE

207
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:43,265
LAW.

208
00:06:43,265 --> 00:06:44,400
>> THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS

209
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,468
TRYING TO CHANGE THE LAW.

210
00:06:45,468 --> 00:06:47,336
>> Laura: FRANCISCO, YOU'RE

211
00:06:47,336 --> 00:06:47,870
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

212
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,740
>> CHECK THIS OUT --

213
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,941
>> Laura: HOLD ON.

214
00:06:51,941 --> 00:06:52,908
FRANCISCO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

215
00:06:52,908 --> 00:06:54,810
THIS LAWS DO NEED TO BE CHANGED.

216
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,146
THE WAY THE ASYLUM LAWS ARE

217
00:06:57,146 --> 00:07:00,049
WRITTEN NOW ARE -- IT'S EASILY

218
00:07:00,049 --> 00:07:00,383
GAMABLE.

219
00:07:00,383 --> 00:07:03,019
IF THAT'S EVEN A WORD.

220
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:05,821
IT'S EASILY GAMED AND IT DOES

221
00:07:05,821 --> 00:07:08,324
HAVE TO BE CHANGED BECAUSE IT'S

222
00:07:08,324 --> 00:07:10,026
ACTUALLY PUTTING THE MIGRANT'S

223
00:07:10,026 --> 00:07:10,926
LIVES AT RISK.

224
00:07:10,926 --> 00:07:12,361
YOU HAVE THESE KIDS CROSSING

225
00:07:12,361 --> 00:07:14,664
THAT ARE BEING MANIPULATED --

226
00:07:14,664 --> 00:07:15,464
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

227
00:07:15,464 --> 00:07:16,999
>> Laura: AND BEING HURT BY THE

228
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:21,904
GANGS AND RECRUITED BY GANGS.

229
00:07:21,904 --> 00:07:24,040
THIS IS A HUMANITARIAN NIGHT

230
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,775
THAT WE HELPED CREATE.

231
00:07:25,775 --> 00:07:27,243
>> GOD BLESS YOU FOR SAYING

232
00:07:27,243 --> 00:07:29,045
THAT.

233
00:07:29,045 --> 00:07:30,813
YOU'RE CORRECT.

234
00:07:30,813 --> 00:07:32,615
>> Laura: WE'RE RUNNING OVER.

235
00:07:32,615 --> 00:07:34,617
THIS JUST CAME OUT TODAY.

236
00:07:34,617 --> 00:07:35,518
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LOSES

237
00:07:35,518 --> 00:07:38,187
TRACK OF 20% OF THE

238
00:07:38,187 --> 00:07:38,954
UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN WITHIN

239
00:07:38,954 --> 00:07:41,490
THREE MONTHS OF THEIR ARRIVING

240
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,560
HERE, THIS IS HHS TESTIMONY

241
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:44,860
TODAY.

242
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,065
THEY HAVE LOST TRACK OF 7,635

243
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:49,865
UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN THAT THEY

244
00:07:49,865 --> 00:07:52,802
HAD TO CHECK IN WITH OVER THE

245
00:07:52,802 --> 00:07:55,037
LAST THREE MONTHS OF LAST YEAR.

246
00:07:55,037 --> 00:07:58,107
THEY LOST TRACK OF 1,500 OF

247
00:07:58,107 --> 00:07:59,508
THOSE AFTER 30 DAYS.

248
00:07:59,508 --> 00:08:01,944
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT ARE.

249
00:08:01,944 --> 00:08:03,946
>> AND THE PEOPLE ARE --

250
00:08:03,946 --> 00:08:05,481
>> MANY OF THE PEOPLE SAY

251
00:08:05,481 --> 00:08:07,483
THEY'RE FLEEING -- THEY SAY

252
00:08:07,483 --> 00:08:09,018
THEY'RE FLEEING GANG VIOLENCE.

253
00:08:09,018 --> 00:08:11,587
THE MINORS ARE ACTUALLY

254
00:08:11,587 --> 00:08:13,622
RECRUITED BY MS-13 --

255
00:08:13,622 --> 00:08:14,790
>> Laura: WE'RE OUT OF TIME.

256
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,125
>> WE HAVE A DIRECT

257
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:16,726
RELATIONSHIP --

258
00:08:16,726 --> 00:08:18,427
>> Laura: WE AGREED ON

259
00:08:18,427 --> 00:08:18,794
SOMETHING.

260
00:08:18,794 --> 00:08:20,396
>> I'LL MEET YOU AT THE BORDER.

261
00:08:20,396 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Laura: FRANCISCO, WE'RE GOING
