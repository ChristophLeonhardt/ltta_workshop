00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,829
in such an interesting position because

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:48,899
your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> vice and that's a platform</font>

20
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,300
primarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> toward to us Millennials and</font>

21
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're reporting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the UN and that's an</font>

22
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:56,280
intergovernmental institution decade's

00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,680
worth of<font color="#E5E5E5"> legacies so in your experience</font>

24
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,710
what is the overall attitude an opinion

25
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,110
of our generation towards a lot of UN's

26
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,180
role in achieving international

27
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,130
corporation do you think we're more

28
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,409
skeptical more idealistic to splitter

29
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:12,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">thoughts great thanks for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks for</font>

30
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,920
that question I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's an important</font>

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,430
question on<font color="#CCCCCC"> one level due to the</font>

32
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do different forms of</font>

33
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,189
communication I think a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of young</font>

34
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:21,509
people are better informed about what

35
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:24,630
the UN is even doing the UN is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all over</font>

36
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">the world it's helping children but it's</font>

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,210
also in a position<font color="#CCCCCC"> where it has to</font>

38
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,770
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that job of it better and</font>

39
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,220
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure people can interact on</font>

40
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,170
directly with with folks in the field

41
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,600
one thing I've noticed in<font color="#E5E5E5"> New York is</font>

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,799
that the internship program here it it

43
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,530
generally includes folks from like

44
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,990
Europe from from maybe East Asian

45
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,009
countries that are a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

46
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,380
off they're not actually from the places

47
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,630
where the UN is helping people the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

48
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,890
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's one thing that could</font>

49
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">be fixed and generally if there's kind</font>

50
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,799
of better availability for for for folks

51
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,469
for so the kids can get in Iraq with you

52
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:07,590
and that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be good and I think that</font>

53
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in general and a lot of it so I</font>

54
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,580
crowdsource this question on facebook

55
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font>

56
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,370
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what my friends wanted to</font>

57
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,610
know about you n and a lot of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

58
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,560
came down to expression<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sort of</font>

59
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,150
disappointment a little bit or just

60
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,760
wanting to understand whether the<font color="#E5E5E5"> un's</font>

61
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,410
what is going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a dent in in</font>

62
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,540
certain areas like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know removing</font>

63
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,580
Assad to<font color="#E5E5E5"> human trafficking which is</font>

64
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,020
initiatives that you know have been

65
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,760
going on for four<font color="#E5E5E5"> decades what do you</font>

66
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,700
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> UN and is is in terms of their</font>

67
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,370
perception to you know our<font color="#CCCCCC"> generation</font>

68
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,500
what are they doing in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that front to</font>

69
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,680
remediate these concerns well I think on

70
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,170
one level the concerns of children are

71
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,510
pretty much our young people Millennials

72
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,730
I guess are now more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than ever the same</font>

73
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,620
as kind of everyone else so as you

74
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,450
mentioned Millennials are worried about

75
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,950
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on in Syria they're worried</font>

76
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,050
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's going on in South Sudan so</font>

77
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,350
in that sense young people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in a</font>

78
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,430
unique position because they're already

79
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,440
online they're already on the internet

80
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,820
they can reach out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to folks they can</font>

81
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the UN directly they can tweet</font>

82
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,330
at them they can you know you can send

83
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">an email to the UN so I think the UN</font>

84
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,070
probably could do a better job of

85
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,440
listening<font color="#E5E5E5"> to those voices because in a</font>

86
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,630
lot of cases children are the ones and

87
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,770
Millennials are the ones that are in a

88
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,750
position to change things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the coming</font>

89
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,510
years so so that's that's what's up yeah

90
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you all right Thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> You Angie</font>

91
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,600
I Sam let's say Diana who's calling us

92
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,420
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hertz alia which is just outside of</font>

93
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:38,040
Tel Aviv hi Anna hi fan how are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you good</font>

94
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,860
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you good thanks for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having me no</font>

95
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,200
thanks for coming on my question has to

96
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,820
do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Palestine joining the</font>

97
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,410
International<font color="#E5E5E5"> Criminal Court this year</font>

98
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,690
mm-hmm I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of noticed that there's a</font>

99
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,760
common perception that the ICC maybe

100
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,860
isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> a highly effective institution I</font>

101
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,780
think this really<font color="#E5E5E5"> came too late last</font>

102
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">month when South Africa clouded the</font>

103
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,710
courts arrest warrant against Sudanese

104
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:02,010
President Omar al-bashir so I was just

105
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">wondering</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an ICC</font>

106
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,290
investigation into Gaza crime crimes

107
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,910
committed in Gaza during the conflict

108
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,650
last summer would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> an opportunity for</font>

109
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,920
the court to restore its credibility

110
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,180
thanks that's a very good question a

111
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">very timely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question given as you</font>

112
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,750
mentioned what happened last month in

113
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,298
South Africa I there obviously are a lot

114
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:23,190
of questions about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ICC's viability</font>

115
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,260
whether it can force you know arrest

116
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,400
warrants and so for

117
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,120
as for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the investigation in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Gaza that</font>

118
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,830
definitely is a territory for the court

119
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,100
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only in the past the court has only</font>

120
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,220
gone after<font color="#E5E5E5"> African individuals so that's</font>

121
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,199
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cases that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have already</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exist</font>

122
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,539
obviously this is a preliminary inquiry

123
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:44,729
so you can't really pronounce so much on

124
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:47,130
what's going to going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen but you</font>

125
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,530
know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a case there the UN</font>

126
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,940
released a report last month that

127
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,520
basically indicted both sides in the

128
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,190
Gaza conflict for possible war crimes so

129
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,740
in that sense it's an opportunity for

130
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,990
the International<font color="#E5E5E5"> Criminal Court to kind</font>

131
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,850
of I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean really for more people to pay</font>

132
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,400
attention to it but you also have to be

133
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,430
careful i think and not invest too much

134
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,740
in this one case in terms of turning

135
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,570
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ICC getting people to pay</font>

136
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,770
attention to it there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other</font>

137
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,440
issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know pre predate this</font>

138
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,870
the US for instance it's not even part

139
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,639
of the ICC<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when you talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to folks at</font>

140
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,560
the UN folks from Africa folks from

141
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,849
other parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the developing world</font>

142
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:25,229
that's kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing they say</font>

143
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:27,419
they say well this is the world body

144
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:30,930
that's supposed to enforce you know

145
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,849
judgments and so forth but some of the

146
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:34,349
main countries on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Security Council</font>

147
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:36,900
aren't even part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I'm glad you</font>

148
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,180
brought<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the UN report on Gaza that</font>

149
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">just came out because I was wondering if</font>

150
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:43,229
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> had any insight into whether the</font>

151
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:46,080
evidence against Hamas were also being

152
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,400
engaged in war crimes during the

153
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,830
conflict would actually damage the same

154
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,510
 that the Palestinians are trying to

155
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,690
advance by joining the ICC well that's

156
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:55,919
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've talked to with</font>

157
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,900
Palestinian officials and you know

158
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,789
they're aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what happens when you</font>

159
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:02,039
give the ICC jurisdiction in this case

160
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,440
in Palestine so dating back to last

161
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,500
summer and obviously given the the

162
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,169
report<font color="#CCCCCC"> that came out last week there are</font>

163
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:11,010
allegations that both sides have

164
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,110
committed war crimes I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's a</font>

165
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,550
chance that they're willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take just</font>

166
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,780
to put myself in their shoes for a

167
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,110
moment I think that they balance the

168
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,030
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the outcomes there and even if</font>

169
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,389
the ICC eventually<font color="#CCCCCC"> indice a Palestinian</font>

170
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:26,520
and Dyson Israeli that I think they

171
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,280
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's worth it one thing you see</font>

172
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,970
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the UN is the kind of malaise about</font>

173
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,060
about Palestine where the Security

174
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,039
Council early this year there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

175
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:39,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">about a resolution that might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

176
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">frame</font>

177
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,500
for withdrawal on the 1967 border from

178
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,639
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> understanding from talking to</font>

179
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">diplomats that's really not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

180
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime soon not to mention the</font>

181
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,490
peace talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> themselves which for many</font>

182
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,530
years were the focus of attention those

183
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">seem to be pretty much dead at the</font>

184
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,889
moment so the ICC is a unique

185
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:59,280
opportunity I think for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Palestinians</font>

186
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,169
at least that's how they view it in

187
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:02,819
light of kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of nothing else really</font>

188
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,940
happening so given the aforementioned

189
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,520
kind of lack<font color="#CCCCCC"> of muscle of the ICC do you</font>

190
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,199
think if they do reach some kind of

191
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,180
verdict after launching an investigation

192
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,909
if they decide to do to do so will that

193
00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:17,030
actually change anything on the ground

194
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,550
well that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question and any kind</font>

195
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,319
of indictment let alone an investigation

196
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,639
so I guess I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just should preface that</font>

197
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,960
you know there's a preliminary inquiry

198
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,210
right now there could possibly be an

199
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,440
investigation in the pistol

200
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,120
investigation and then there could

201
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,250
possibly be you know indictments and so

202
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,629
forth should the ICC years down the line

203
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:38,669
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is my understanding it might be</font>

204
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:41,460
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time frame you know indict sand</font>

205
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,379
Israeli someone in the military or

206
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,229
someone in Hamas whether they can

207
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:49,650
enforce that remains to be seen so I

208
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,569
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the optics at this point</font>

209
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:53,849
are more important<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then what</font>

210
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:56,909
the eventual in diamond is or what you

211
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,229
know if someone gets goes to the Hague

212
00:07:58,229 --> 00:07:59,909
which seems probably pretty unlikely

213
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:03,300
given the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> Israel and Hamas have kind</font>

214
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,889
of interacted with with international

215
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:08,310
organs such as the ICC<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay great that's</font>

216
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">really interesting thank you thanks for</font>

217
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,409
coming on yeah thanks Anna I'm calling

00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:17,099
what we've got another skype caller at

220

225
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,520
coming on<font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks um so I've been reading</font>

226
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,559
a lot of your work<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially on South</font>

227
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,750
Sudan which it has Smith<font color="#CCCCCC"> grey and very</font>

228
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,059
enlightening and currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my</font>

229
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,919
internship at control arms we've been

230
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,870
I've been personally following the South

231
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,449
Sudan and conflict very closely and we

232
00:08:45,449 --> 00:08:47,100
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the UN Security Council has</font>

233
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,320
sanctions placed and just indicted and

234
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,060
six people on those sanctions

235
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,670
only for travel and<font color="#CCCCCC"> assets so what do</font>

236
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,170
you think the next step should be for

237
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,670
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Security Council do you think an</font>

238
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,350
arms embargo would be a good next step

239
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">and do you think that actually have an</font>

240
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,790
impact on<font color="#E5E5E5"> South Sudan on the ground yep</font>

241
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,300
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say that's a very good</font>

242
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,160
question as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned an arms</font>

243
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,630
embargo is kind of in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing</font>

244
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's floated at the council my senses</font>

245
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">that might be again a bit of a ways off</font>

246
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,240
as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the sanctions mechanism for</font>

247
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,970
South Sudan was only implemented in

248
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,220
March so it's taken a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> months for</font>

249
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,270
them to even come up with these names

250
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,520
things on South Sudan unfortunately

251
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,410
seemed to go pretty slowly at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

252
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:31,440
Security Council I mean there's probably

253
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,730
many reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that there are a number</font>

254
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,410
of crises in the world but I think that

255
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably a lot of folks I think maybe in</font>

256
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">your field to think they should be</font>

257
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,779
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit quicker and</font>

258
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,970
addressing those things but as you

259
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,529
mentioned an arms embargo might be a

260
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:46,020
good next step that's how some people

261
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,720
see it also the African Union has a

262
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,760
commission of inquiry in South Sudan and

263
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,690
that's another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to look out for</font>

264
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,480
they've kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know they said they</font>

265
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,800
finished it and but they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

266
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,130
release it until peace talks are kind of

267
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,260
achieved something and based on what's

268
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,670
happened in the past few weeks it really

269
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,530
doesn't seem like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that those were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

270
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,600
anywhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> and some of the atrocities are</font>

271
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,850
really really disturbing so there's an

272
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,290
argument to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be made for releasing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

273
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,670
know a lot of human<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights groups in</font>

274
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,700
fact have pushed for that to happen yeah

275
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,890
I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> following up on that I know</font>

276
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very closely at the UN and</font>

277
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">behind the scenes a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit on treaty</font>

278
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,150
negotiations and I've been kind of aware

279
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,310
with arms trade treaty and just moving

280
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,170
forward how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think treaties and</font>

281
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,089
negotiations behind the scenes can

282
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:33,350
hopefully affect long-term situations

283
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,970
well I think South Sudan is a perfect

284
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,980
example for that<font color="#CCCCCC"> where a treaty such as</font>

285
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,500
the you know the ATT could could be

286
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,410
helpful tracking weapons and both<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

287
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,970
south sudan and in car in the Central

288
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">African Republic next door a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

289
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">violence is being committed with very</font>

290
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,779
kind of low-level weapons and a treaty

291
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:53,370
such as that would be would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be helpful</font>

292
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,350
in tracking that as<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're behind the</font>

293
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">scenes I think that it's important for</font>

294
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,000
for folks to kind of bring bring these

295
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,040
kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i would say simmering</font>

296
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,000
conflict but the violence is really

297
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,920
incredible in South Sudan so I don't

298
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,890
think simmering is the right word but

299
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,600
these long-standing conflicts if they're

300
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,100
brought to the attention i think that

301
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,290
could add a little impetus to de tree

302
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,030
negotiations bring it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> their attention</font>

303
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:20,470
yeah yeah one<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing once again I</font>

304
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,420
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are all pretty clear and aware</font>

305
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,970
that South Sudan is very underreported

306
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,880
and very lacking media attention and i

307
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,280
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you actually really report on</font>

308
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,890
it quite frequently so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

309
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,990
why do you report on it and why do you

310
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that is that it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so under</font>

311
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,760
reported in general so well those are

312
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,550
two really good questions I report on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

313
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,980
because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that well my editors</font>

314
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,870
want me to report them the two<font color="#CCCCCC"> I should</font>

315
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">mention but at the security it's a</font>

316
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,080
conflict where it seems more accessible

317
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,150
in some way for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Security Council you</font>

318
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,940
look at situation in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Syria people don't</font>

319
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,530
quite know what to do there's those

320
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">actors on the council</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taken</font>

321
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,610
one side or the other and there's a real

322
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,220
logjam in terms of any sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> action to</font>

323
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,360
say nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the level of violence</font>

324
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,960
there and on South Sudan as in the

325
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,300
Senate rodica<font color="#E5E5E5"> Republic that seems like a</font>

326
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,839
environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> where the UN could do have a</font>

327
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:18,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a greater effect and the Security</font>

328
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,680
Council if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> take action on an arms</font>

329
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,020
embargo for instance that would have

330
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,950
probably have a much more impactful

331
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">effect than if you did something similar</font>

332
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,560
in Syria if that were an option yeah I

333
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean since there is president and two</font>

334
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,360
since the EU has an arms embargo to

335
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,490
South Sudan and so is America's de

336
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,440
there's precedent to possibly do one

337
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,230
embargo internationally as well so thank

338
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,760
you so much thanks for coming on

339
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,280
appreciated thank you yeah thanks a lot

340
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,410
I'm sorry I said San Francisco instead

341
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,320
of New York obviously you're in New York

342
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right well I Sam you know we</font>

343
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually just got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sweet a second</font>

344
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,490
from one of our viewers named<font color="#CCCCCC"> melchor</font>

345
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,339
wants to know if the UN has<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned</font>

346
00:12:57,339 --> 00:12:59,380
anything from what happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Rwanda</font>

347
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,839
during the 90s do you think any lessons

348
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,280
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rwanda can be applied to South</font>

349
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,760
Sudan absolutely yeah I mean that's

350
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,160
really a black mark on the UN over 20

351
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,760
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago now they now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have new kind of</font>

352
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,110
doctrines responsibility to protect you

353
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:14,640
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

354
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,680
when you see something like this happen

355
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,740
or signs that something atrocities may

356
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,090
be committed<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if they're not on the</font>

357
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">level of the genocide in Rwanda so I</font>

358
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,190
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> on one level the UN</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has learned</font>

359
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,590
that peacekeepers are also in positions

360
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,450
that they haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> been in the past and</font>

361
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:33,330
they're able to protect more people at

362
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,740
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time there's questions about</font>

363
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,840
whether they should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing more</font>

364
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,100
particularly in South Sudan where

365
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,020
they're basically overwhelmed protecting

366
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,810
I think it's now over 140,000 South

367
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,490
Sudanese who are seeking shelter with

368
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,480
them and they're they're basically

369
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,680
unable to leave and go do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> else</font>

370
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,440
the UN has learned I think they probably

371
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,280
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> people would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say they could do</font>

372
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,640
learn even more well you know we can all

373
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,530
learn more and speaking of<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

374
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">more let's see if our next caller Miguel</font>

375
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,580
can get you to learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit with</font>

376
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,800
his questions so let's say to me go<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

377
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">right hello a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Sam thank you for</font>

378
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,750
taking my questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh first of all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

379
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">just wanted to ask whether you think</font>

380
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,090
there's a root cause to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the to Puerto</font>

381
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,370
Rico's current debt crisis or do you

382
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:22,130
think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a series of courses and</font>

383
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:25,380
yeah just rolls you know give give give

384
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:29,580
rise to the to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the crisis uh-huh thanks</font>

385
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,790
we go so I went<font color="#CCCCCC"> down to Puerto Rico in</font>

386
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,760
February to report on basically the same

387
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,260
issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're talking about now this</font>

388
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,370
week<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that what the governor</font>

389
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">announced that they couldn't repay their</font>

390
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,560
debt it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like there's a lot of</font>

391
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,750
reasons why puerto rico's in the

392
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,820
situation it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you may know</font>

393
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,440
them better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> even I do for many</font>

394
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">years the economy was doing quite well</font>

395
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,290
it had<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of tax breaks it had a</font>

396
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,790
competitive advantage over some other

397
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,220
countries manufacturing left those tax

398
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">breaks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> left I think probably as you</font>

399
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,940
aware if you read the Puerto Rican press

400
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,830
you see also a high level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of corruption</font>

401
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,260
where money is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of divvied up</font>

402
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,930
there's consultancies that they don't

403
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,850
seem to<font color="#CCCCCC"> add up people getting money and</font>

404
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">other things the government also in the</font>

405
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,140
report that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> released</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Monday that was</font>

406
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,630
commissioned by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Governor got to be up</font>

407
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,300
idea it mentioned that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the government</font>

408
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,700
pretty regularly would just take out

409
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,390
loans

410
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,370
to cover deficits they also kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

411
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,100
didn't have the capacity to get taxes

412
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,770
they would make em tax<font color="#CCCCCC"> Amnesty's and</font>

413
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:37,440
that's set a bad precedent and obviously

414
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">I haven't even mentioned the kind of</font>

415
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">political dynamic in Puerto Rico where</font>

416
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,360
it's still unresolved and it's not clear

417
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,050
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to happen right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

418
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,960
particle can't file for bankruptcy which

419
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,970
other means which means polities can do

420
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:53,460
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rest of the country so that's my</font>

421
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:57,480
sense but yeah and it's important you

422
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,580
mention the the political dynamic

423
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:03,060
because i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you know part of the</font>

424
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,800
reason and maybe they've told you

425
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,060
something different is that this you

426
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,580
know taking of a bond corruption has

427
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,960
been going on it's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

428
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,810
mostly been due to the to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> political</font>

429
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,810
structure the fact that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

430
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,450
different from the states our political

431
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:24,120
parties do not base himself<font color="#CCCCCC"> on economic</font>

432
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,850
policy there's not like a liberal party

433
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,850
and I really conservative party so I

434
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:33,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that's you know taken away from</font>

435
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:37,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">the actual governing and I you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know I'm</font>

436
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:40,560
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create your take on what do you</font>

437
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,230
think it's important<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all countries</font>

438
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,720
especially in Puerto Rico to have

439
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,300
parties which base you know base their

440
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,670
positions on economic policy instead of

441
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,130
you know status or any other you know

442
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:58,100
legal you know legal problems which

443
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:03,840
short term is still the issues that that

444
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,720
face you know every country so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

445
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,699
my question was yeah that whether you

446
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:12,030
think you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that's that made an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issue</font>

447
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,500
that would be a main issue the fact that

448
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,630
parties the parties the main parties

449
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,150
that governess do not you know give

450
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,859
utmost importance<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the economic issues</font>

451
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:25,619
thanks that's a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> question you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

452
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,359
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> when i went down to Puerto Rico</font>

453
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,340
was that dynamic was clear to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that</font>

454
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,800
that kind of economic issues weren't as

455
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,240
clear as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of just basically</font>

456
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,520
party affiliations obviously it's not

457
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,140
necessarily unique to Puerto Rico the

458
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">rest of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> US I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of people</font>

459
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,320
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> vote</font>

460
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">online but that sense of kind of parties</font>

461
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,130
kind of coming back and forth one party

462
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,820
in power one party next<font color="#E5E5E5"> time is in power</font>

463
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:54,360
no one really<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to kind of ruffle</font>

464
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,039
feathers kind of end the business as

465
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:59,610
usual some of the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of social welfare</font>

466
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,740
programs maybe could have been run a

467
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,330
little bit better not to say that they

468
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,639
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be cut or anything but I think no</font>

469
00:18:05,639 --> 00:18:08,549
one really wanted to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and there's</font>

470
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:09,899
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of vested interests the business</font>

471
00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:11,610
community in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> political class seem to</font>

472
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,190
be you know kind of switch and chairs

473
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,649
sometimes but again same thing in the

474
00:18:16,649 --> 00:18:19,710
rest of the US but as you mentioned I

475
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,659
think the political status how that's

476
00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:23,460
unresolved I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a huge</font>

477
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,460
element here no one really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of can</font>

478
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,870
step forward on<font color="#E5E5E5"> those platforms that</font>

479
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,870
might be in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of the be viable in</font>

480
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,840
the rest of the country because people

481
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,340
don't quite know what Puerto Rico is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

482
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,779
it that's my sense when I was talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

483
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:38,659
people people you know the independence

484
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,889
statehood it's a number of questions

485
00:18:40,889 --> 00:18:45,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are unresolved yeah oh thank you</font>

486
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,769
thank you for taking my<font color="#E5E5E5"> question Sam and</font>

487
00:18:46,769 --> 00:18:49,139
that was a great article by the way you

488
00:18:49,139 --> 00:18:52,470
wrote on Puerto Rico Thanks ago I had

489
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,419
some so we're almost at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the</font>

490
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:55,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">show now but you know we actually did</font>

491
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,000
get a couple more tweets about Puerto

492
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,470
Rico great<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want you to take a look at</font>

493
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,240
one of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'm do you think the</font>

494
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">federal government the US federal</font>

495
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,720
government should bail out puerto rico

496
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,879
and why did thousands of Puerto Ricans

497
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:07,769
leave the island for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the u.s. I know you</font>

498
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:10,409
wrote a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about this so what</font>

499
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:13,860
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> your thoughts well a bailout I guess</font>

500
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,440
there's there's two issues here right

501
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,720
now there's you could literally bail out

502
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,399
puerto rico you could you know pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

503
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:23,179
dead I think in Washington that's really

504
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:26,070
not not being floated I think that would

505
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,740
run into a lot of opposition my I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

506
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,570
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what what should be done but</font>

507
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,879
the other option is chapter 9 bankruptcy

508
00:19:32,879 --> 00:19:35,629
which would allow a kind of orderly

509
00:19:35,629 --> 00:19:38,129
process that would you know creditors

510
00:19:38,129 --> 00:19:39,960
would be at the same table with the

511
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,929
government and there's a bill in

512
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:44,070
Congress now that would allow Puerto

513
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,440
Rico to do that it remains to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seen</font>

514
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,299
what kind of support that will get some

515
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:51,149
folks some Congress men and women are

516
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:52,840
against that they would<font color="#CCCCCC"> prefer</font>

517
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,029
financial control board which would give

518
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:59,380
more protection to the kind of less

519
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,919
power to the to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> local government I</font>

520
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,880
think chapter<font color="#CCCCCC"> nine is what you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

521
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,610
look out<font color="#E5E5E5"> for in the future and and and</font>

522
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,470
see how those bills go in Congress as

523
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,870
for why thousands of really hundreds of

524
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,279
thousands of Puerto Ricans<font color="#CCCCCC"> leave the</font>

525
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:15,000
island for the US for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> States</font>

526
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,740
basically there's there's a ton of

527
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,409
reasons unemployment is very high only

528
00:20:20,409 --> 00:20:23,500
forty percent of the population is kind

529
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,029
of in the workforce a lot of folks have

530
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:26,950
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of given up on jobs when I</font>

531
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,020
went down to Puerto Rico I interviewed a

532
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,960
lot of young people and you know one

533
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,640
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I should mention is especially in</font>

534
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,200
San Juan you run into a lot of really

535
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,210
highly educated folks people that have

536
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:40,210
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know high level degrees and they</font>

537
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,529
just kind of don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what to do there</font>

538
00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:44,320
they end up working in you know kind of

539
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,419
minimum-wage jobs and they don't see a

540
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:49,330
way out so if I was in that position I

541
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:53,289
might leave too I there's there's

542
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:56,289
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of reasons but the</font>

543
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:59,110
economy is definitely the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one all</font>

544
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">right well you know I like I told some</font>

545
00:21:01,899 --> 00:21:03,399
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our guests before the show we can</font>

546
00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:05,049
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> each of these issues for at</font>

547
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:08,260
least 30 minutes that but you know and

548
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,899
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have 30 minutes so I Sam we're</font>

549
00:21:10,899 --> 00:21:12,279
at the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the show when she</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

550
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:13,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">goodbye</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to everybody at home thanks</font>

thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> for coming on goodbye and tune in</font>

552
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,720
next week the<font color="#E5E5E5"> United Nations reported</font>

553
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,010
that the entire western part of the

554
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:23,140
country has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> cleansed of Muslims and</font>

555
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,270
is now debating deploying a peacekeeping

556
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,659
operation<font color="#CCCCCC"> well the time we spent in the</font>

557
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:30,610
Central<font color="#E5E5E5"> African Republic really was a</font>

558
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:33,399
major turning point in the conflict when

559
00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:35,110
the French troops came in to put a stop

560
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,090
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> celicas reign of terror it was a</font>

561
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:39,640
welcome sight for many but everyone

562
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,610
underestimated the anti-balaka and

563
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,809
despite them promising that they would

564
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:45,399
drop their weapons after the celica left

565
00:21:45,399 --> 00:21:48,610
they proved to be just as destructive

566
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,190
the UN sending peacekeepers would be a

567
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:54,070
step in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right direction</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it could</font>

568
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,840
be a long time before Muslims are safe

569
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,860
again and bengi and an even longer time

570
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,510
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> those who are forced</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to leave can</font>

come back
