white liberals as a great work of genius the the guy opens up if you don't know childish gambino that's the alter ego of Donald Glover he's a TV writer he's won Emmys he's really talented guy and so this is the guy who opened up his song redbone with the words but stay woke just to give you an idea of his politics there's new song is called this is America and Democrats love it because this song it's supposed to be a searing indictment of the US and the Second Amendment and police brutality and I don't know whatever other lefty things you want to throw in there America is the worst place ever man do Democrats love it and this the reason it's interesting culturally the reason we have to talk about it and everyone is missing what they should be taking away is the point of this song is it supposed to be in part a satire of old minstrel shows shows of black men you know mocking black men and all of this in reality this type of entertainment is the modern-day minstrel show we'll get to that later first let's take a look at the video got you sleeping are you sleeping now you get the idea so for those who couldn't see for those who were just listening Donald Glover comes on in and he's dancing and it's all fun and happy that's a nice little beat you know and then he goes up to a hooded guy and just pulls out a gun and blasts him right in the head and he comes in there's a nice black choir singing and they're in sort of regalia and it's all nice and happy Donald Glover comes in dancing and then just mows them all down with an ak-47 and this and this is America right there singing all this nice stuff and then when you start shooting people this is America that's what they're saying it's searing indictment comes in cars on fire in the background gang crime and it just reminds you of Democrat run cities that's what it'll look at this is supposed to be this is America this is Democrat run cities it's supposed to look like Detroit all of the cars you know on fire being broken down the last time a Republican ran Detroit Pericles was running Athens but listen to the lyrics so if for those who couldn't make out quite what's being said I think you could it's just the lyrics are awful the lyrics begin this is the this is the first stanza yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah go go away yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah go go away not exactly Shelly or John Keats or anything not even you know Isaiah Berlin that this is the lyrical content but we'll get to we'll get to why this is terrible artwork later first let's just talk about the politics so it opens up we just want a party party just for you we just want the money money just for you I know you want a party party just for me yes this is America guns in my area I got the strap I got a carry-on and by the way what you should say is I get to carry them because in all of the other countries in the world when there are guns and knives in their area you don't get to carry them and then you get killed and you don't get to protect yourself the lyrics goes on America I just checked my following list and you go tell somebody you mother eva's Oh me so before we go on here that that's crucial part you owe me things are terrible people are getting shot everything's bad all of the nice things all of the nice dancing that's just a facade and really we're just getting gunned down there's there is actually one interesting political line he says here which is this is a celli that's a tool and what he's referring to is this is a cell phone and there have been instances of black men being shot dead because they pull out a cell phone and the cops think it's a gun and it's a tense situation and it's the difference.we guns and cell phones right guns are a tool cell phones are a tool because they can actually protect against overreach by the government the whole song is just terrible political commentary it is but it's importantly it's just political commentary without the political terror commentary the phone is there the sergeant the phone the song is dreadful it's not good art even with the political commentary it's not very good but this is the evidence of a bad work of art if the work of art only stands on its politics it isn't good art it's it's why it's what comedians have to do it's why Jimmy Kimmel has to just give political monologues and cries cuz he's not telling he can't tell good jokes so it's a crutch but why the crazy dance why is Donald Webber doing this crazy dance one of the theories suggested here is he's doing exaggerated poses like in minstrel shows like in the Jim Crow South there the lyric he says his grandma told me get your money black man get your money go out there and get your money and what critics are suggesting is this is a little bit of a distraction so you're not seeing all the bad stuff that's going on in the background he's showing how we get distracted by popular entertainment and we get distracted by modern minstrel shows and that this is supposed to be a satire of a minstrel show all of the big crazy faces all of the wild dancing and happy-go-lucky singing and jumping around we'll get back to that because that's the whole key race hustlers from Hollywood to New York from these music videos to the pages of the Atlantic they are providing the new minstrel show it's the same old audience of white Democrats but it's the new minstrel show all of that later first keeping it real kanye West is extolling the virtues of free thought and speaking his mind and according to TMZ producer van Latham that is most certainly not keeping it real if you say what you think and you're explaining the world as you see it that is not keeping it real but then if you just do automatically what other people tell you to do even if it's not a true narrative that is keeping it real I understand why you're confused keeping it real is another leftist euphemism I I did this Praeger video that's gotten a lot of play from last week and it's about how the left morphs language transforms and perverts language to mean the opposite of what it says it means keeping it real is a great example of this because keeping it real is the opposite of what it said keeping it real is really keeping it unreal Vann Lathan said I'm disappointed I'm appalled and brother I'm unbelievably hurt by the fact that to me you Kanye West have morphed into something that is not real what is real Chris Rock the comedian Chris Rock gives some guidance on what real is then not no one to answer to your question Oh keeping it real keep it real keeping it real keeping it dumb that's what it is Chris Rock this is a good example of you know funny because it's true the people are laughing at this because it is true and Chris Rock is really good at this kind of social commentary is he's using this expression this leftist euphemism which is primarily a stereotype of a black saying keeping it real and he's saying what keeping it real means it's not keeping it real means keeping it dumb it means you know this being proud to say no I don't want education no I don't want to better myself I don't I don't want to better my circumstances in my family life in my personal life I want to keep it real as if to save reality is the opposite of improvement and keeping it real keeping it dumb brings us to ton the easy coats who is trending on Twitter last time I checked town easy coat says every white liberals favorite magazine writer all of your is pseudo sophistic at white liberal friends will love tong easy coats and i'll explain why in a minute tawny easy coats is the MacArthur Genius grant winner National Book Award winner he's won a ton of awards he just wrote a piece attacking Kanye West for speaking his mind and embracing Donald Trump the title of that piece is I'm not black I'm Kanye I'm not black I'm Kanye what he's referring to is the old expression from OJ Simpson I'm not black I'm og oj saying i transcend my race i'm not just gonna be ghettoized into this one a particular characteristic and demographic you want to put me in I'm bigger than that so just from the title now we note on easy coats is comparing Kanye to a wife-beating double murderer the piece only gets worse from here taani hazy coats opens up using these phrases like the yawning whiteness this is why white liberals love it so much you say oh yes we are boring yes we do y'all we're yawning yes keep keep talking yeah that's right of course you couldn't use that phrase about any other racial group or ethnic group you couldn't talk about the the bellowing Italian miss or something you know you can you bet but you can use it went on easy coach uses in the Atlantic this oh yes well how brave how strong so then Don Eazy coats compares kanye west to michael jackson the the black god dying to be white you know because Michael Jackson bleached his skin so first this within a few paragraphs kanye west compare town easy codes compares kanye west to a double murderer wife-beater and then he compares him to a child molesting drug addict but this is that this is the great erudite serious thinker she opens up with these two outrageous comparisons codes then makes a series of stupid points and I think he's being obtuse here because he is either being obtuse or he is genuinely dumb and I don't think he's genuinely dumb I tend to think it's the former so Coates takes issue that Kanye said the Donald Trump not Barack Obama proof that Kanye could be President Kanye said this he said yeah I when Donald Trump became president I realized I could become president this is obviously true but all taani z-code sees is color alt uneasy coatsy's is Oh Barack Obama's black and Kanye is black that should be the inspiration but what kanye west is seeing is Barack Obama is this harvard-educated lawyer political activist guy and Donald Trump is a pop culture figure I'm a pop culture figure I'm not a lawyer I'm not a political activist I'm just a pop culture guy if the big outrageous pop culture guy can become president so can i that is the much truer comparison but all coatsy's is color and all he writes about is color so coats then takes issue with Kanye West calling Chicago the murder capital of the world so last year Chicago had a fifty nine point four percent increase in murders over 2015 this is the highest level of murders since the mid 1990s which was a huge high in gun murders Chicago has this shocking number of murders but Tana heezy coats wants to point out the rate the per capita of murder rate is lower than st. Louis and Detroit and a few other terrible cities so you know Kanye lied so what Kanye said is not true cuz you know Chicago has some really nice neighborhoods so that brings down the per capita murder rate you know there's a lot of business that happens there so breezed it so so what Kanye West said is not true this is totally dishonest criticism is that or is that really what you're saying you're saying Chicago had a 59% increase in the murder rate more than one person on average can die every day and be murdered every day in Chicago but oh you call it the murder capital of the world it's really only the third murder case Capital obviously by the way when you call something a murder capital of the world in America you're obviously speaking hyperbolically isn't but people it's not like people don't know that Fallujah exists that these two awful war-torn cities Raqqa exists cities they're at war in the Middle East no one's suggesting that those places aren't awful and don't have higher murder rates you're speaking hyperbolically obviously Chicago has a very high murder rate and Kanye West made the right criticism he said Barack Obama came up on race hustling he's from Chicago and Chicago didn't improve it got worse during his tenure maybe that says something about his policies so totally dishonest from codes coats then criticizes West very telling Lee because West never fell into the bitterness of his peers that's a quote he never grew up and became bitter the criticism is that he never got bitter that he didn't you Kanye you you'd never decided to start dividing and falling into a victimhood and aggrievement culture even though Kanye by the way because you haven't done that you've succeeded beyond your wildest dreams Coates becomes hysterical at this point he then says Michael Jackson endorsed the destruction of all black people that's actually a claim in this absurd Atlantic article and then Coates concludes quote and so for Kanye West I wonder what he might be if he could find himself back into connection back to that place where he sought not a disconnected freedom of I but a black freedom that called him back back to the bone and drum back to Chicago back to home if a white writer had written this article he would be run out of town on a rail for it's absurd blatant racism because what would Coates is saying to West is come back he said literally says come back to the bone and drum come back to your inescapable immutable irrational racial roots come back keep it parochial keep it divided keep it tribal keep it bitter keep it real that's what he's saying what is real what is real what would it mean to really keep it real to keep it really really real taani easy Coates has won the Hillman Prize the National Magazine Award the George Polk award the Harriet Beecher Stowe award the American Library Fellowship American Library in Paris fellowship the National Book Award and the MacArthur Genius grant probably the most sought-after award in the world what about Donald Glover childish gambino Donald Glover is won multiple Emmy Awards a Grammy Critics Choice Award multiple Writers Guild Awards and the the n-double-a-cp award the list goes on and on multi-millionaire I think that last check he's got well over 12 million dollars but what do they have in common one of these two guys have in common they push a grievance narrative to a largely white audience they push this narrative that blacks are necessarily kept down they can't succeed hard work won't cut it got to keep it divided got to keep it real stop pretending that you can make it in America Kayne shut up stop saying that people can make it in America if they just better themselves and educate themselves and follow certain social mores that will ensure success for their children or make it far more likely that their children will succeed and that they will succeed simple social mores that are open to everybody stop telling them that tell them that they can't succeed that they got to stay down and yet ironically Donald Glover and Tanya he's he coats are proof in themselves that this narrative isn't true how many awards have they won how many millions of dollars have they made combined what social and cultural influence do they have combined and but then they don't preach what they practice because the narrative sells their their own lives their testament that doesn't sell the Kanye true narrative doesn't sell but that this narrative sells this is the modern minstrel show yeah that's what it is the critics are calling this this donald glover video an assault on minstrel shows it is in reality is the complete opposite it is the modern minstrel show for those who don't know what a minstrel show is for you know the sixteen year olds in the audience who didn't you haven't studied this or seeing this and in the old days minstrel shows portrayed black people as inept and frivolous and unable to better themselves here's an example of one my friends it is indeed a financial pleasure to have so many of you resemble here today on this auspicious occasion see so it's the white person puts on the black face and the big white lips and then mispronounces words so says resemble instead of a symbol and suspicious instead of auspicious haha' he's a dimwit who can't really better himself and hahaha and then the white audience laughs and the white audience applauds and this didn't just exist in the 19th century in the early 20th this happened in the 70s a little bit to television shows like good times come to mind good times was created by white lefties shows created by Norman Lear that kind of thing and they pretend that they're attacking problems in some ways they're offering social commentary but it's also the same effect you know you have the the wild crazy black character saying the catchphrase and then although mostly white liberal audience laughs and applauds so what is the minstrel show today because at the time they didn't realize that that those were modern-day minstrel shows in the 1970s what's their minstrel show today the left is totally delusional they're looking for another amos and andy they're looking for this with the big black face and the big white lips and everything the modern-day minstrel show doesn't look like that the modern-day minstrel show on the pages of the atlantic and in music videos portray precisely the same thing though don't they they they they're the old minstrel shows played primarily to white Democrat audience the the new minstrel shows precisely the same audience they played to exactly the same group of people Kanye West is rejecting that ridiculous a narrative that he and and Glover and Coates proved by their very lives and careers is untrue so what are the race hustlers do what what do these guys do they they do the same thing that they did to Candace Owens and to Thomas soul and to Clarence Thomas to every other black person who has ever had the temerity the abject audacity to question the enfeebling Democrat narrative of grievance they pilloried them as Uncle Tom's that's all they ever heard Uncle Tom's there in authentically black their race traders they're the worst kind of evil they say how dare you speak for yourself how dare we have a narrative here's the script here's the script you have to your we gave you the script you have I know listen I know that I've won the MacArthur Genius award and I've succeeded beyond my wildest dreams because this is the land of opportunity and obviously if you work hard over enough time you can better yourself that's not the script you got it here take the script and dance play your part and dance that's what they tell them to do and it's despicable and it by the way it shows what courage it takes to contradict that entrenched prevailing interest that's been around for a very long time what courage it takes for a guy like Kanye West we kind of joke about him because Kanye West is an eccentric crazy character takes a lot of guts to do what he did takes a lot of guts for that guy to tweet out Thomas soul quotes and to say I like Candace Owens and to say I enjoy listening to Jordan Peterson takes a lot of guts because then he'll be acute because of what the minute he describes reality as it really is as he sees it they'll say no you're not keeping it real you're gonna how dare you how we're gonna come after you were gonna pillory you and it isn't it isn't just racial issues that you see this on because conservatives should be pretty careful here that there are actually racial issues in the country we like to say there aren't racial issues at all but then obviously we know that there are racial issues in the United States there are different rates of earning different rates of marriage out of wedlock birth abortion crime education it the majority of black babies in New York City are aborted rather than born that is a major racial issue and you can't you can't blame all of that on the legacy of slavery that's what the Left wants to do they say those all the legacy of slavery it's all that you can't blame it all on that you can you can in part blame it on the legacy of Democrats in the Great Society you can in part blame it on the good intentions policies of affirmative action and the good intentions allegedly policies of the Great Society you can import blame it on exclusion you can import blame it on a legacy of division but they're clearly regardless of if you're gonna blame it on historical ills or modern policies or Democrats or mostly just Democrats I guess you'll blame it on clearly there are issues there's no question about that and I've never really liked sometimes on the right we see this issue so clearly and then we really want to explain it so we use that the Democrat plantation language we say the Democrats are keeping blacks on the plant because it's evocative language I don't really like that I find it kind of condescending I'd I just I don't think it achieves anything I think it people listen to say are you kidding me who are you to tell me but we shouldn't be reactionary that plays into the left hands too and and the speaking of the left hand the minstrel see the minstrel show of keeping it real extends way beyond a rapper and an essayist it extends way beyond Donald Glover and Tana hazy coats it is all over the place it is all over the Academy the university is the mainstream media it's everywhere it see it is beyond racial issues 40% of colleges have no Republican professors 40% have none it's not to say 60% of professors are Democrats 40% of colleges have no Republican professors that's according to a National Association of scholars article they lack even one Republican professor Mitchell Lambert who's an associate professor of business at Brooklyn College shows that seventy eight point two percent of academic departments sampled had zero Republicans or so few quote as to make no difference so what happens in that case what happens when your college has not a single person who contradicts the politically correct perspective well then you don't get any perspective you don't get any other ideas it's a it's a ghettoizing experience this is an example of that euphemism how keeping it real is the opposite of real it is the opposite the university is the opposite of that the how the the place that is supposed to promote intellectual curiosity and freedom and the relentless pursuit of truth it does the opposite of that the same is true of the mainstream media after the 2016 election the executive editor of the New York Times Dean Baquet said quote if I have a maiya culpa for journalists and journalism it's that we've got to do a much better job of being on the road out in the country talking to different kinds of people than we talk to especially if you happen to be in New York based news organization and remind ourselves that New York is not the real world and that is true I can I tell I can promise you that having spent a lot of time in New York it's not the real world there's a new study in the journal of expertise I have to say how many of these journals are there they have all of these gentleman has started to like the Journal of cough FA or something they have the Journal of this in the Journal of that I don't know how reliable they are but the Journal of expertise shows a majority of staff writers and editors at the New York Times in the Wall Street Journal come from elite universities Harvard Yale Princeton all the you know universe they they have a measure based on median SAT score or something 52% of times staff writers and editors 54% of Wall Street Journal staff writers and editors now you might say well those are prestigious places it's not surprising that they come from prestigious universities this actually is a fairly new thing net that the the journalism that reporting the news is for the elites the very very highly educated and specifically educated in the old days the elite grads they wouldn't go to The Wall Street Journal they would go to Wall Street and make a ton of money or they would go to industry and make a ton of money they would they wouldn't go to report the news newspaper reporting was more of a trade it was a specialty you had to have a relentless dog in pursuit of a story you had it was sort of something wrong with you same thing with artists you know there had to be something wrong with you to say well I I don't want to make a lot of money I want to put myself in a lot of danger I want to work really really hard but I want to pursue the truth I want to pursue these stories it wasn't reporting wasn't really meant for these big ego elite types because those guys they want to prescribe or proscribe rather than describe what they're seeing they want to give their commentary they want to offer what they think the society should look like or why it's looking this way rather than just reporting the events as they see them and in part it's because to actually do good investigative reporting is very hard and very hard work and you don't get a lot of accolades and glamour for it so all of the big ego people they want to prescribe you know they've they've read through Sidda T's so they want they say oh I can explain this to you and by the way that's what we're seeing now at all of these places that used to do good investigative work we're now seeing a proliferation of commentary masquerading is reporting there's what is real what's really real well this is it's the commentary of these people but is it their reporting this is why they get it so so wrong because look on this show at the daily wire on the bench Pierrot show the Andrew Clavin show whatever matt walsh show we say this is commentary this is our perspective this is cultural commentary new york times doesn't do that the new york times says this is the news but they give exactly the same amount of commentary the exact amount of political opinion as any other commentary network does they say but these are the facts CNN just the facts the washington post democracy dies in darkness just the facts i'm a banana but that's nonsense which is why they're dishonest which is why they're fake news and that's why they get it so wrong it creates a totally parochial point of view that has delusions of cosmopolitanism or or universality or any of this but they're not they come from the same little schools that come from the same little cities they go to the same little dinner clubs they read the same thani AZ Coates essay they give it the same applause the the left is right about one thing they don't know that they're right but they're right about one thing bigotry is insidious it's very hard to detect they're right about that they're not detecting it you know they're certainly not they talk about the unconscious biases they yeah they're not conscious of them because they are demanding the left demands and pushes a false narrative that blacks specifically but racial minorities more broadly cannot succeed they just can't they're just inept they're just as inept and helpless as the minstrel shows of the days gone by never mind that this narrative is demonstrably false that's what the audience demands that's what the Atlantic audience demands and very sadly performers of this false narrative are gonna dance to the same old tune they're doing it now and it's trending on Twitter and they're gonna win more awards for it and they're gonna keep they're gonna make even more ridiculous claims in that same old audience that's good oh oh oh that's right you can't better yourself oh it's really really sad and maybe people will someday be able to see through the insidiousness of that that bigotry but probably not anytime soon okay enough about race do we haven't a little bit of time so I'm glad I'm glad before we had to cut to break that we were able to get to Kanye watch for the 17th day in a row I think this show is basically going to be renamed the Kanye West program kanye west analysis we got to get to the news before we get to the news I'm sorry I'm sorry I have to say goodbye to Facebook in YouTube we got so much to talk about I want to talk about Rosie O'Donnell going to the clink throwing Rosie O'Donnell behind bars hopefully I want to talk about John McCain a little bit and John McCain at look it appears that he's in the last days it looks like he's dying of aggressive brain cancer but he ain't going out without a fight and he's hitting a lot of former allies so we'll talk about that but if you're not on daily wire.com I got to say goodbye to you if you are there thank you very much you almost keep the lights on you keep khofifah in my cup go over there right now you get it's $10 a month $100 for an annual membership you get me at the end work laven show you get the Ben Shapiro show you get the Matt Walsh show that is you can check out now if you if you ever thought you know Pablo is not Catholic enough for me then you can then you can watch the Matt Walsh show and you it gets your fill so I go over there right now you'll get to ask questions in the conversation that's coming up next one up is little ol me so you can ask the questions everybody can watch only subscribers can ask questions many are called few were chosen but that doesn't matter mmm hold on just got to keep it real a little bit over here I'm gonna kid oh those are real that is keeping it real those are the Kanye West vintage leftist tears they have been pouring in as Hawaii spews lava so to the continental United States has been spewing leftist ears ever since Kanye West said that he like Donald Trump and those are real that is it's hard to tell keeping it real from real these days that is oh wow go over I'm gonna take a few gulps myself go to daily wire.com you'll get the leftist to your tumblr we'll be right back with the news dee-lish so let's get to a really happy news story Rosie O'Donnell is in trouble with the law if justice is blind Rosie O'Donnell may now be headed to the clink we are joined for comment by President Donald Trump mr. president your reaction I like to see bad people fail Rosie failed I'm happy about it she's basically a disaster well she called me a snake oil salesman and you know coming from Rosie that's pretty low because when you look at her and when you see the mind the mind is is weak I don't see it I don't get it I never understood how does she even get on television I believe Barbara made a terrible mistake putting her on and I think Barbara's probably paying a big price when you see the mind you know you're totally right mr. president the mind is weak the - we so Rosie apparently made illegal campaign donations on five separate occasions and when you donate to a political candidate there was a limit for campaign donations in this case I believe the limits $2,700 and Rosie XT exceeded it apparently vastly exceeded it so you might recall you're having deja vu all over again dinesh d'souza the conservative filmmaker and columnist he did this - he did this exact same thing for his friend Wendy long and I was working races in New York when Wendy long was running in this race Wendy long was his old pal from Dartmouth she was never gonna win this Senate seat in New York and he donated $20,000 to her instead of the legal limit so he donated over the limit one certainly not enough money to make any difference in politics and to a race that was unwinnable it just wasn't going to happen for this great crime dinesh for giving a little extra money to his old college pal in a race that was never gonna win he was sentenced to five years probation eight months and a halfway house and a thirty thousand dollar fine the reason that Dinesh got this usually these cases aren't prosecuted the reason that he was prosecuted and sent to the clink is because he was a major critic of Barack Obama he made these films against Barack Obama he was a relentless critic of Obama so he was selectively prosecuted and sentenced to a absurd time for this this minor first-time offense Rosie O'Donnell has donated way more money than that to many more candidates apparently $90,000 in just this cycle alone and then when she was called out on it she claimed ignorance she said well I didn't know what there was a limit I didn't know what the limit was the mind the mind it's just not there as Donald Trump says the mind is not so she said I didn't know how was I supposed to know I mean I know it's the law and it's written on every campaign website and it's actually by law clearly spelled out but it you know if it was too much the candidates should return the money but as you might know ignorant of the law is no excuse that's not an excuse not to be prosecuted so will she be prosecuted I don't know usually the first time offenders don't get prosecuted rosie is clearly a multiple time offender here is justice blind are they gonna go after Rosie it's funny because last time Obama was in office and Obama hated dinesh and now at Trump is in office and Donald Trump is Rosie O'Donnell's primary antagonist in the entire world there was that time during the ED well point out Rosie started the fight but that during the debate megyn kelly said Donald Trump you have called women slobs and pigs and idiots and this and then and the interrupted he said only Rosie O'Donnell oh so who knows is justice blind there are two points on this that you should think about one is justice under the law if it's good for dinesh it's got to be good for Rosie what's good for the goose is good for the gander also we should think about the justice of the law these these are limits on campaign contributions I think this is a terrible law I think it's anti-constitutional I don't think we should have these sort of limits on how much you can give to a political candidate because one it's anti-constitutional it suppresses your your political speech we know that money is speech if I it costs money to make a big yard sign it costs money to to write an op-ed it costs money to publish things it costs it speech can require money and your speech will reach a certain number of people depending on how much money you spend but we know that in the Citizens United case speech was we know that people don't lose their constitutional rights to free speech just because they organized in groups so I find all of these campaign finance laws anti-constitutional but it also it doesn't achieve what it wants to achieve it just creates shady backroom ways for the money to transfer big politics is always going to attract big money this is an argument for small government if you don't want big money in politics don't have big politics have small government but also the minute you start limiting donating to a campaign or donating it to this then you're gonna have more money going to the party structures that's going to give more corruption for the party bosses to pick winners and losers you're going to have super PACs which are apparently shady or the Democrats hate super PACs you're just gonna put the money there and this brings us to John McCain John McCain is the big proponent of campaign donation limits John McCain his major campaign law campaign mccain feingold was struck down in the citizens united decision the famous citizens united decision that said that people don't give up their rights when they were organizing groups mccain was very angry about that decision this was one of his landmark pieces of legislation now john mccain is dying and it looks like he's in his last days so people are gonna not criticize him they're not going to attack him because the you don't want to attack a dying man which is perfectly right it is distasteful to unnecessarily speak ill of the dead and the dying but in the last few minutes here i would like to point out john mccain seems to be taking advantage of this of this social more a because he's not going peacefully he's not saying i just you know want to spend my last days just only talking about the nice things and enjoying my impressive life he's launching a memoir he's a he just leaked that he doesn't want donald trump at his funeral he's attacking Trump he he's willing to have Barack Obama at his funeral but not Donald Trump he's he's releasing this memoir that's coming out at the end of this month and in that memoir he's throwing his former running mate Sarah Palin under the bus this is I don't want to attack John McCain am I gonna spend time attacking John McCain but I do want this to be a cautionary tale because John McCain doesn't this Palin thing throwing Palin under the bus it became so fashionable for all of the sophisticated Republicans to attack Sarah Palin oh she's a hick oh she's has a silly accent oh she doesn't read enough newspapers Oh blah blah blah right and become very fashionable especially when they lost John McCain picked her now you can say all day all me to pick her and I didn't want to pick her while the buck stops somewhere pal and you john mccain picked sarah palin she served him very ably on the campaign she helped his campaign people revisionists now say oh she dragged that he might have won if not for her no way his polling was in the doldrums and then she came on and she really helped his polling now now John McCain is in his final days and he decides to throw her under the bus he makes one last jab at the sitting Republican president and he throws his former running mate under the bus this is all in keeping with a trend among Republicans to really want to win the affection of the New York Times Republicans should never try to win the affection of the New York Times do not do it this is the swamp mentality this is what happens when Republicans come to identify more with their pseudo sophisticate Democrat critics than they do with their own constituents and they don't dance with the guy who Brun them you know the the Republican candidates get elected because of conservatives because of their base and then the minute they get to Washington they say oh I don't want to be with those those people are dirty in there then they they don't read the Atlantic or whatever so I please a New York Times like me like me I'm not like them this is a particular political disloyalty by the way that history does not look fondly upon everyone thinks in the moment they say oh I can't oh I don't like the Tea Party because they're too direct and they speak too plainly and they like the Constitution too much you know I'm not like them I go I drink Manhattan's I drink node I read the Atlantic who are these who are the political disloyal people who don't like their own base Mayor John Lindsay of New York does history remember him is he one of the great men oh yes John as John Lindsay said you see epitaphs everywhere big statues always judges the great John Lindsay said like Nelson Rockefeller as the wonderful political leader Nelson Rock no you don't you forget these people they're not the great leaders of the Republican Party or of any movement it's a weak sauce it's really weak sauce you will never as a conservative or as a Republican win the affection of the New York Times you'll win it for a moment when it's instrumental and it's useful and then they'll stab you in the back as they did to John McCain in 2008 they were really really nice to him during the primary they were really really nice to him attacking George Bush in 2000 and when he was attacking other conservatives in 2008 and then he gets the nomination they go right back to their guy and they attacked John McCain happens every time they they they they will not reward you betraying your base or the confidence of your base it looks desperate don't do it a cautionary tale okay we'll get to more we're at a time we'll get to more news tomorrow in the
