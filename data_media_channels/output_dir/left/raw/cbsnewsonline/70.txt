WE SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT THE 

38
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:08,301
DEMOCRATS HAVE SAID THIS IS A 

39
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:09,368

THIS ASSERTION IS NOT 

355
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:37,863

363
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:56,282
AS A -- AS A SUPREME COURT HAS 

364

ASSURANCE OF CONFIDENTIALITY, A 

368

385
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,823

558
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:01,512
VOTE ON IT. 

559
00:18:01,512 --> 00:18:02,781
THE RESPONSE IS THAT MR. 

560
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,216
CHAIRMAN YOU HAVE GIVEN WITH 

561
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,317
ALL DUE RESPECT, REALLY FLY IN 

562
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:09,755
THE FACE OF THE NORMS OF THIS 

563
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,088
COMMITTEE. 

564
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:12,290
OUR TRADITIONS AND OUR RULES. 

565
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,993
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, AAGREE WITH MY 

566
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:15,293
COLLEAGUE. 

567
00:18:15,293 --> 00:18:17,096
IT'S STRIKING GIVING YOUR LONG 

568
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,730
HISTORY OF ENCOURAGING THE 

569
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,166
EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO TREAT 

570
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,601
MINORITY REQUESTS EQUAL WITH 

571
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,468
MAJORITY REQUESTS THAT YOU 

572
00:18:23,468 --> 00:18:26,438
DISCOURAGE THE NATIONAL 

573
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,272
ARCHIVES FROM RESPONDING TO 

574
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,507
RANKING MEMBER FEINSTEIN'S 

575
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:29,942
REQUESTS WHICH SHE TRIED TO 

576
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,110
CRAFT WITH YOU TO BE IDENTICAL 

577
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,512
WITH THE REQUEST FOR JUSTICE 

578
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:33,745
KAGAN. 

579
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:34,312
WE SHOULDN'T BE PROCEEDING 

580
00:18:34,312 --> 00:18:35,280
UNTIL WE HAVE THE FULL 

581
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,748
DOCUMENTS THAT ALLOW US TO 

582
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:37,916
REVIEW THE JUDGE'S RECORDS. 

583
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,050
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, LAST FRIDAY WE 

584
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,420
LEARNED THAT NEAR I 1 MONEY 

585
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,620
2,000 PAGE -- 102,000 PAGES OF 

586
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,690
DOCUMENTS FROM HIS WORK IN THE 

587
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,290
WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL'S OFFICE 

588
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,959
ARE BEING WITHHELD FROM THE 

589
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,227
COMMUNITY AND THE PUBLIC. 

590
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:52,598
BASED ON A CLAIM OF 

591
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:53,131
CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGE. 

592
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:53,732
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE HAS NEVER 

593
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:54,999
BEEN INVOKED TO BLOCK THE 

594
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:56,568
RELEASE OF PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS 

595
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:57,969
TO THE SENATE DURING A SUPREME 

596
00:18:57,969 --> 00:19:00,105
COURT NOMINATION. 

597
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:01,339
THIS INCLUDES WHEN JUSTICE 

598
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:03,909
KAGAN WAS NOMINATED TO THE 

599
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,678
SUPREME COURT, AS WELL AS JUS 

600
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:07,379
THE ROBERTS.

ROBERTS. 

603
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:09,715
YESTERDAY WE SENT A LETTER TO 

604
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:12,551
THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL ASKING 

605
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:13,652
THE PRESIDENT WRAITHS CLAIM OF 

606
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,553
PRIVILEGE OVER THE DOCUMENTS SO 

607
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,221
THEY CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE TO 

608
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:17,555
THE COMMITTEE AND TO THE 

609
00:19:17,555 --> 00:19:18,457
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

610
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:19,858
WE HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED A 

611
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,393
RESPONSE TO THAT LETTER. 

612
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:22,927
SO WE SHOULD NOT BE PROCEEDING 

613
00:19:22,927 --> 00:19:26,932
UNTIL WE HAVE A RESPONSE AND 

614
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,401
THESE DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN 

615
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:29,701
AVAILABLE. 

616
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:30,702
IT IS 102,000 DOCUMENTS. 

617
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:34,539
>> MR. CHAIRMAN -- MY MOTION TO 

618
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:36,175
ADJOURN WOULD RAISE THIS ISSUE 

619
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,809
OF EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE AND 

620
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,010
WHETHER IT HAS BEEN PROPERLY 

621
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,213
ASSORTED FOR REASONS THAT HAVE 

622
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,948
BEEN OUTLINED WELL BY MY 

623
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:43,882
COLLEAGUE SENATOR WHITE HOUSE. 

624
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,850
THERE'S NO VALID CLAIM HERE OF 

625
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:46,485
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE. 

626
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:49,454
EVEN IF THERE WERE ONE IT'S NOT 

627
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:50,088
BEEN PROPERLY ASSERTED. 

628
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:53,225
THE QUESTION IS, WHAT IS THE 

629
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:53,925
ADMINISTRATION AFRAID OF 

630
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:54,525
SHOWING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE? 

631
00:19:54,525 --> 00:19:56,261
WHAT IS IT TRYING TO HIDE? 

632
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,196
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, USING YOUR OWN 

633
00:19:58,196 --> 00:20:00,132
WORDS IN THE STATEMENT YOU JUST 

634
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,533
READ YOU SAID I QUOTE -- WE 

635
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,468
HAVE HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME 

636
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:05,671
TO RE-- ENOUGH TIME TO REVIEW 

637
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:06,171
THE DOCUMENTS. 

638
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,306
SIR WE JUST GOT A DOCUMENT DUMP 

639
00:20:08,306 --> 00:20:09,908
LAST NIGHT OF OVER 40,000 

640
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,008
PAGES, I WOULD SAY NOT ONE 

641
00:20:11,008 --> 00:20:13,478
SENATOR HERE HAS READ THROUGH 

642
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:13,911
THE 40,000 PAGES. 

643
00:20:13,911 --> 00:20:15,013
WE ARE CONTINUING TO RUSH 

644
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,282
THROUGH THE PROCESS A PROCESS 

645
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:18,950
THAT DESERVING TO BE 

646
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:19,283
SCRUTINIZED. 

647
00:20:19,283 --> 00:20:19,917
I SUPPORT SENATOR BLUMENTHAL'S 

648
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:21,185
MOTION TO ADJOURN AND I HOPE 

649
00:20:21,185 --> 00:20:22,654
THAT WE CAN AT LEAST HAVE A 

650
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:23,988
VOTE ON THAT MOTION. 

651
00:20:23,988 --> 00:20:27,526
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I THINK YOU'D 

652
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:28,627
BE HARD-PRESSED TO FIND A COURT 

653
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:32,330
IN THE COUNTRY THAT WOULD NOT 

654
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,233
GIVE A PARTY LITIGANT A 

655
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,935
CONTINUANCE WHEN THE PARTY ON 

656
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:39,638
THE OTHER SIDE DID A 42,000 

657
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:40,539
PAGE DOCUMENT DUMP AFTER CLOSE 

658
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:44,309
OF BUSINESS THE NIGHT BEFORE 

659
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:44,542
TRIAL. 

660
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:47,112
>> WE WAITED FOR MORE THAN A 

661
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,347
YEAR WITH A VACANCY ON THE 

662
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,747
SUPREME COURT UNDER THE 

663
00:20:49,747 --> 00:20:51,015
DIRECTION OF YOUR LEADER IN THE 

664
00:20:51,015 --> 00:20:55,620
UNITED STATES SENATE. 

665
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,387
AND THE REPUBLIC SURVIVED. 

666
00:20:56,387 --> 00:20:58,724
I THINK THE TREATMENT WAS 

667
00:20:58,724 --> 00:20:59,991
SHABBY OF MERRICK GARLAND AND 

668
00:20:59,991 --> 00:21:00,691
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S NOMINEE. 

669
00:21:00,691 --> 00:21:04,096
THE FACT WE CANNOT TAKE A FEW 

670
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,198
DAYS OR WEEKS HAVE A COMPLETE 

671
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:06,832
ARE YOU OF JUDGE BRETT 

672
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:08,633
KAVANAUGH'S -- REVIEW OF JUDGE 

673
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:09,801
BRETT KAVANAUGH'S REVIEW IS NOT 

674
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,069
FAIR TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

675
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:12,204
UNDER ARTICLE 2 SECTION 2 OF 

676
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:14,906
THE CONSTITUTION TO ADVISE AND 

677
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:23,282
CONSENT ON SUPREME COURT  

678
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,015
NOMINEES. 

679
00:21:24,015 --> 00:21:24,448
>> SENATOR KORNYN? 

680
00:21:24,448 --> 00:21:27,685
YOU WANT TO SPEAK. 

681
00:21:27,685 --> 00:21:29,087
>> I WOULD JUST SAY THAT 

682
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:30,489
SENATOR WHITEHOUSE SUGGESTED 

683
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:31,723
THAT WE HANDLE THIS HEARING 

684
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:32,657
LIKE A COURT OF LAW. 

685
00:21:32,657 --> 00:21:34,826
BUT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT IF 

686
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:39,131
THIS WERE A COURT OF LAW, THAT 

687
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,266
VIRTUALLY EVERY SINGLE MEMBER 

688
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,001
ON THE DAIS, ON THAT SIDE WOULD 

689
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,369
BE HELD IN CONTEMPT OF COURT. 

690
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:46,204
BECAUSE THIS WHOLE PROCESS IS 

691
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,206
SUPPOSED TO BE A CIVIL ONE. 

692
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:49,741
WHERE PEOPLE GET TO ASK 

693
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:52,076
QUESTIONS AND WE CAN GET 

694
00:21:52,076 --> 00:21:52,343
ANSWERS. 

695
00:21:52,343 --> 00:21:54,613
AND THAT'S THE BASE BASIS UPON 

696
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,848
-- BASIS UPON WHICH WE ARE TO 

697
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:57,949
EXERCISE OUR CONSTITUTIONAL 

698
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:59,050
RESPONSIBILITIES OF ADVICE AND 

699
00:21:59,050 --> 00:21:59,317
CONSENT. 

700
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:04,189
JUST SUGGEST WE GET ON WITH THE 

701
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:04,489
HEARING. 

702
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,124
>> IF MY COLLEAGUES -- 

703
00:22:07,124 --> 00:22:09,327
>> I COULD JUST RESPOND? 

704
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:10,929
IF WE CAN JUST RESPOND TO THAT. 

705
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,498
>> YOU CAN RESPOND BUT JUST A 

706
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:13,731
MINUTE. 

707
00:22:13,731 --> 00:22:15,634
>> IF PEOPLE WONDER WHY THE 

708
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:18,804
CHAIR IS SO PATIENT DURING THIS 

709
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:20,305
WHOLE PROCESS, I HAVE FOUND 

710
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:22,274
THAT IT TAKES LONGER TO ARGUE 

711
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:25,811
WHY YOU SHOULDN'T DO ANYTHING 

712
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:26,644
THAN LET PEOPLE ARGUE. 

713
00:22:26,644 --> 00:22:27,278
WHY THEY WANT IT. 

714
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:30,048
THESE THINGS ARE GOING TO BE 

715
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,515
SAID THROUGHOUT THIS HEARING. 

716
00:22:31,515 --> 00:22:34,553
WE'RE GOING TO BE IN SESSION 

717
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:35,520
TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, 

718
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,589
FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY, UNTIL 

719
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:38,924
WE GET DONE THIS WEEK. 

720
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:44,329
SO HOWEVER LONG PEOPLE WANT TO 

721
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:47,132
TAKE, WE'RE GOING TO NOT 

722
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:47,699
NECESSARILY ACCOMMODATE ALL 

723
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,167
OBSTRUCTION, BUT IF PEOPLE GOT 

724
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:49,968
SOMETHING TO SAY, THIS CHAIRMAN 

725
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:52,303
IS GOING TO LET THEM SAY IT. 

726
00:22:52,303 --> 00:22:53,371
BUT IT GETS PRETTY BORING TO 

727
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,707
HEAR THE SAME THING ALL THE 

728
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:55,907
TIME. 

729
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:59,544
SENATOR BOOKER, MAKE IT QUICK 

730
00:22:59,544 --> 00:22:59,777
PLEASE. 

731
00:22:59,777 --> 00:23:02,781
>> I REALLY APPRECIATE THE 

732
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:03,281
DEFERENCE MR. CHAIRMAN. 

733
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:04,649
THE QUESTION WAS WHY WOULD WE 

734
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:05,316
WANT TO DELAY THIS? 

735
00:23:05,316 --> 00:23:08,920
AND THIS IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO 

736
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,154
DELAY. 

737
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,422
THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO BE FULLY 

738
00:23:11,422 --> 00:23:12,624
EQUIPPED TO DO OUR 

739
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:13,157
CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY WHICH 

740
00:23:13,157 --> 00:23:13,725

TAKE SERIOUSLY. 

743
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:19,931
IT IS VERY HARD TO PERFORM OUR 

744
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:22,768
ROLE OF ADVISE AND CONSENT WHEN 

745
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,302

VETTING OF THE BACKGROUND OF

755
00:23:41,752 --> 00:23:42,788
WE'RE DENIED THE FULL VETTING 

756
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,155
AND SIR, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING 

757
00:23:44,155 --> 00:23:46,924

THAT'S PUT BEFORE US. 

783
00:24:36,974 --> 00:24:37,675
IT'S UNDERMINING OF THE 

784
00:24:37,675 --> 00:24:38,910
CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE TO WHICH WE 

785
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,278

YOUR POLITICAL PARTY IN THE

00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,676
CAUCUS, AND I'M GOING TO PHRASE 

795
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,546
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THE 

796
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:17,281
CONTACT QUOTES IN FRONT OF ME. 

797
00:25:17,281 --> 00:25:18,083
. RECENTLY SENATOR SCHUMER SAID 

798
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,352
IN FRONT OF THE FLOOR, THE BEST 

799
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,653
JUDGE OF WHETHER OR NOT 

800
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,488
SOMEBODY SHOULD BE ON THE 

801
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:25,357
CIRCUIT COURT IS DECISIONS THAT 

802
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:31,062
THEY'VE MADE AT LOWER COURTS. 

803
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:32,931
SENATOR LEAHY SAID SOMETHING 

804
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:35,467
SIMILAR TO THAT WHEN SENATOR 

805
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:39,370
SOTOMAYOR WAS BEFORE US THAT WE 

806
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:41,239

807
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,942
YOU HAVE DONE IN A LOWER COURT 

808
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:45,944
THAT IS THE BEST BASIS FOR 

809
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:46,945
KNOWING WHETHER OR NOT YOU 

810
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:51,349
OUGHT TO BE ON THE SUPREME 

811
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:51,582
COURT. 

812
00:25:51,582 --> 00:25:54,352
SO WE HAVE 307 CASES THAT THIS 

813
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:55,320
NOMINEE HAS WRITTEN DECISIONS 

814
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:02,060

REPUBLICAN SIDE HAS GONE 

823
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:20,544
THROUGH THEM. 

824
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,347
>> BUT SIR, WHY DID YOU ASK FOR 

825
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:24,215

830
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,988
RECORD OF 7,000 PAGES PER HOUR. 

831
00:26:30,988 --> 00:26:34,759
THAT IS SUPER HUMAN. 

832
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,226
>> THEY'RE AMAZING. 

833
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:37,094
THEY'RE AMAZING. 

834
00:26:37,094 --> 00:26:43,101
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, IF I MAY. 

835
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,736
I'VE BEEN THROUGH NINE SUPREME 

836
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:45,436
COURT HEARINGS. 

837
00:26:45,436 --> 00:26:47,405
>> IS THIS YOUR OPENING 

838
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:48,306

839
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:49,340
>> IT'S PART OF IT. 

840
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,042
>> WHY DON'T YOU PEAK YOUR 

841
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:51,609
OPENING STATEMENT HEARING.

845
00:26:57,047 --> 00:26:57,348
CHALLENGED. 

846
00:26:57,348 --> 00:27:02,186

OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO WHAT 

850
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:09,027
I BELIEVE WAS A PERSONAL 

851
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:09,260
ATTACK. 

852
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,329
>> I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU

858
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,240
THAT THIS IS MY NINTH HEARING 

859
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,775
AND I THINK WE'VE GOT TO LOOK 

860
00:27:24,775 --> 00:27:26,010
AT THIS. 

861
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,346
THESE ARE VERY UNIQUE 

862
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:29,080
CIRCUMSTANCES. 

863
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,750
NOT ONLY IS THE COUNTRY DEEPLY 

864
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,351
DIVIDED POLITICALLY, WE ALSO 

865
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:35,786
FIND OURSELF WITH A PRESIDENT 

866
00:27:35,786 --> 00:27:40,024
WHO FACES HIS OWN SERIOUS 

867
00:27:40,024 --> 00:27:40,324
PROBLEMS. 

868
00:27:40,324 --> 00:27:41,760
OVER A DOZEN CABINET MEMBERS 

869
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,863
AND SENIOR AIDS TO PRESIDENT 

870
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:47,165
TRUMP HAVE RESIGNED, BEEN 

871
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,300
FIRED, OR FAILED THEIR 

872
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:53,238
CONFIRMATIONS UNDER CLOUDS OF 

873
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:56,841
CORRUPTION, SCANDAL, AND 

874
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:57,142
SUSPICION. 

875
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:58,209
THE PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL 

876
00:27:58,209 --> 00:27:59,210
LAWYER, CACKLE CAMPAIGN 

877
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,347
MANAGER, DEPUTY CAMPAIGN 

878
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,481
MANAGER, AND SEVERAL CAMPAIGN 

879
00:28:04,481 --> 00:28:05,583
SUPERVISORS HAVE BEEN ENTANGLED 

880
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,886
BY GUILTY PLEAS AND 

881
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:08,319
CONVICTIONS. 

882
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:12,323
SO IT'S THIS BACKDROP THAT THIS 

883
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:14,459
NOMINEE COMES INTO WHEN WHAT 

884
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:18,563
WE'RE LOOKING AT IS, IS HE 

885
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:19,998
WITHIN THE MAINSTREAM OF 

886
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:21,833
AMERICAN LEGAL OPINION AND WILL 

887
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:28,473
HE DO THE RIGHT THING BY THE 

888
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:29,507
CONSTITUTION? 

889
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:31,910
WE ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING THE 

890
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,978
VETTING PROCESS THAT HAS CAST 

891
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:36,314
ASIDE TRADITION IN FAVOR OF 

892
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,016
SPEED. 

893
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,185
WHEN JUSTICE SCALIA DIED, 

894
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:41,853
REPUBLICANS REFUSED TO EVEN 

895
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:44,889
MEET, EVEN A MEETING IN THEIR 

896
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,024
OFFICE WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA'S 

897
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:50,161
NOMINEE AND HELD THE SEAT OPEN 

898
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:50,728
FOR ONE YEAR NOW WITH A 

899
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:53,164
REPUBLICAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE 

900
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:54,732
THEY'VE CHANGED THEIR POSITION. 

901
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:57,402
THE MAJORITY RUSHED INTO THIS 

902
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,570
HEARING AND IS REFUSING TO EVEN 

903
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:03,741
LOOK AT NOMINEE'S FULL RECORD. 

904
00:29:03,741 --> 00:29:06,644
IN FACT, 93% OF THE RECORDS 

905
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:08,012
FROM KAVANAUGH'S TENURE IN THE 

906
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:10,014
WHITE HOUSE AS COUNSEL AND 

907
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:14,719
STAFF SECRETARY HAVE NOT BEEN 

908
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:15,286
PROVIDED TO THE SENATE. 

909
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:19,157
AND 96% HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN TO 

910
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:19,557
THE PUBLIC. 

911
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:24,429
WE DO KNOW WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE 

912
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,764
THINKS OF THIS NOMINEE. 

913
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,800
DON MCGANN, THE WHITE HOUSE 

914
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,802
COUNSEL, SPOKE TO THE 

915
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:31,836
FEDERALIST SOCIETY AND MADE 

916
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:32,904
CLEAR BRETT KAVANAUGH IS 

917
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:37,909
EXACTLY THE KIND OF NOMINEE THE 

918
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:38,877
PRESIDENT WANTED. 

919
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,144
IN A SPEECH, MR. MCGANN 

920
00:29:40,144 --> 00:29:42,447
DISCUSSED HIS TWO LISTS OF 

921
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,414
POTENTIAL SUPREME COURT 

922
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:43,882
NOMINEES. 

923
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:47,185
ONE HE SAID WAS FILLED WITH 

924
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:47,685
MAINSTREAM CANDIDATES. 

925
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:49,987
THE OTHER LIST INCLUDED CABBED 

926
00:29:49,987 --> 00:29:53,724
DATES THAT ARE KIND -- INCLUDED 

927
00:29:53,724 --> 00:29:55,626
CANDIDATES THAT ARE TOO HOT FOR 

928
00:29:55,626 --> 00:29:55,927
PRIME TIME. 

929
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:56,828
PROBABLY PEOPLE THAT HAVE 

930
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:57,228
WRITTEN A LOT. 

931
00:29:57,228 --> 00:30:01,099
WE REALLY GET A SENSE OF THEIR 

932
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:01,332
VIEWS. 

933
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:04,535
THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT MAKE 

934
00:30:04,535 --> 00:30:05,436
PEOPLE NERVOUS. 

935
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:06,805
THAT IS A QUOTE. 

936
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,040
NOW WHAT I'M SAYING, THIS IS 

937
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,143
THE BACKDROP INTO WHICH WE COME 

938
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,078
INTO THIS SITUATION. 

939
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:16,848
SO YES, THERE IS FRUSTRATION ON 

940
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:17,515
THIS SIDE. 

941
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:22,420
WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE 

942
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,154
PRIOR NOMINEE, THE LAST ONE 

943
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,855
PRESIDENT OBAMA PRESENTED TO 

944
00:30:24,855 --> 00:30:25,390
US. 

945
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,990
HE NEVER EVEN GOT A MEETING. 

946
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,992
HE NEVER GOT A HEARING. 

947
00:30:28,992 --> 00:30:32,096
HE NEVER GOT A VOTE. 

948
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:34,966
AND NOW THE RUSH TO JUDGMENT 

949
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:39,037
AND THE INABILITY TO REALLY 

950
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,471
HAVE A CIVIL AND POSITIVE 

951
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:42,607
PROCESS ENDS UP BEING THE 

952
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:42,840
RESULT. 

953
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,311
I REALLY REGRET THIS BUT I 

954
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:47,178
THINK YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND 

955
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:50,748
THE FRUSTRATION ON THIS SIDE OF 

956
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:51,048
THE AISLE. 

957
00:30:51,048 --> 00:30:51,849
EVERYONE ON THIS SIDE OF THE 

958
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:54,352
AISLE WANTS TO DO A GOOD JOB. 

959
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:57,255
THEY WANT TIME TO BE ABLE TO 

960
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:58,823
CONSIDER WHAT THE FINDINGS ARE. 

961
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:02,493
AND THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS 

962
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:06,698
OF PAGES OF E-MAILS AND OTHER 

963
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,966
ITEMS WHICH COULD CONSTITUTE 

964
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:10,401
FINDINGS ON A WHOLE HOST OF 

965
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:11,636
MAJOR SUBJECTS THAT THIS 

966
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:13,704
NOMINEE MAY BE FACED WITH. 

967
00:31:13,704 --> 00:31:16,707
AND THEY ARE SERIOUS. 

968
00:31:16,707 --> 00:31:17,141
THE TORTURE ISSUES. 

969
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:18,643
ALL OF THE ENRON ISSUES HE'S 

970
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:18,976
BEEN THROUGH. 

971
00:31:18,976 --> 00:31:21,713
ALL OF THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT 

972
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:25,816
WE WANT TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT. 

973
00:31:25,816 --> 00:31:27,418
SO I MEAN, UNDERSTAND WHERE 

974
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:28,352
WE'RE COMING THERE. 

975
00:31:28,352 --> 00:31:31,689
IT'S NOT TO CREATE A 

976
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:34,392
DISRUPTION, IT'S NOT TO MAKE 

977
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:39,664
THIS A VERY BAD PROCESS, IT IS 

978
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:44,102
TO SAY MAJORITY GIVE US A TIME 

979
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:46,471
TO DO OUR WORK SO WE CAN HAVE A 

980
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:47,238
POSITIVE AND COMPREHENSIVE 

981
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,707
HEARING ON A MAN THAT MAY BE 

982
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:56,214
THE DECIDING VOTE FOR MANY OF 

983
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:57,115
AMERICA'S FUTURES. 

984
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,549
>> I ASK FOR A SECOND. 

985
00:31:58,549 --> 00:31:59,817

I ASK THAT WE RECONVENE AND

HAVE A VOTE. 

990
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,560
>> I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN 

991
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,095
TO YOU, WE'RE HAVING A HEARING. 

992
00:32:12,095 --> 00:32:13,197
IT'S OUT OF ORDER. 

993
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:14,665
WE'RE NOT IN EXECUTIVE SESSION. 

994
00:32:14,665 --> 00:32:17,201
THAT WOULD BE THE PROPER FORM 

995
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:18,569
FOR ENTERTAINING MOTIONS. 

996
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,171
>> I ASK THAT RECONVENE IN

>> WE WON'T VOTE ON SENATOR

WE WON'T FOLLOW YOUR 

1001
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:26,210
SUGGESTION. 

1002

I UNDERSTAND MY COLLEAGUES WANT 

1080

1081
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,858
STRONGLY ABOUT THIS.

1083
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,226

ARE WE GOING TO BE ALLOWED TO

00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:05,836
INTERRUPT EACH OTHER? 

1086

00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,447
DIVIDED FOR PEOPLE THAT THINK 

1144
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:58,015
JUDGE KAVANAUGH SHOULD BE ON 

1145
00:36:58,015 --> 00:36:58,949
THE SUPREME COURT AND PEOPLE 

1146
00:36:58,949 --> 00:37:01,619
THAT THINK HE SHOULD NOT BE ON 

1147
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:02,453
THE SUPREME COURT. 

1148
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:04,322
AND WE HOPEFULLY GET THAT DONE 

1149
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:04,555
FRIDAY. 

1150
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,023
BUT IF WE HAVE TO GO SATURDAY 

1151
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:06,890
AND SUNDAY, WE'LL GO SATURDAY 

1152
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:09,460
AND SUNDAY UNTIL WE GET IT ALL 

1153
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:09,994
DONE. 

1154
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:12,129
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, HOW CAN WE 

1155
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:12,529
POSSIBLY -- 

1156
00:37:12,529 --> 00:37:14,699
>> DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR 

1157
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:15,599
QUESTION, SENATOR KENNEDY? 

1158
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,735
>> WELL, IF I WANT -- YES, MR. 

1159
00:37:18,735 --> 00:37:19,370
CHAIRMAN. 

1160
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:19,770
I APPRECIATE IT. 

1161
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,339
IF I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING, DO 

1162
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:25,076
I NEED TO BE RECOGNIZED BY THE 

1163
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:25,476
CHAIR? 

1164
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:27,478
>> THAT WOULD BE THE WAY THAT 

1165
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:27,845
IT'S HANDLED. 

1166
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:29,480
I'VE TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO YOU, I 

1167
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,881
WANT TO BE PATIENT BECAUSE 

1168
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:32,717
SOMETIMES IF YOU ARE NOT 

1169
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:33,584
PATIENT AND YOU ARGUE WHY 

1170
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,019
SOMETHING SHOULDN'T BE DONE, IT 

1171
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,021
TAKES LONGER THAN IT DOES JUST 

1172
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:37,721
TO LISTEN TO PEOPLE. 

1173
00:37:37,721 --> 00:37:38,956
BUT I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD 

1174
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:41,292
HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE SAME 

1175
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,560
THING THREE OR FOUR TIMES. 

1176
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,229
>> WELL PATIENCE IS GOOD, MR. 

1177
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:45,496
CHAIRMAN. 

1178
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:47,765
BUT I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND 

1179
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:48,098
THE RULES. 

1180
00:37:48,098 --> 00:37:49,967
>> YEAH YOU SHOULD BE 

1181
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:50,267
RECOGNIZED. 

1182
00:37:50,267 --> 00:37:51,702
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE 

1183
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:53,637
BEEN PATIENT AND LISTENED TO 

1184
00:37:53,637 --> 00:37:56,207
PEOPLE NOT BE RECOGNIZED AND 

1185
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,042
SPEAK ANY WAY BECAUSE I WOULD 

1186
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:00,311
LIKE TO HAVE THIS BE A PEACEFUL 

1187
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:00,745
SESSION. 

1188
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:03,147
>> BEFORE I TRY YOUR PATIENCE, 

1189
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:03,413
I'M DONE. 

1190
00:38:03,413 --> 00:38:05,316
>> MR. CHAIRMAN I HAVE A 

1191
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:07,084
QUESTION ABOUT GROUND RULES. 

1192
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:07,684
>> GO AHEAD. 

1193
00:38:07,684 --> 00:38:09,220
>> THE QUESTION IS, BEFORE WE 

1194
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,721
CAN PROCEED, I WOULD LIKE TO 

1195
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:12,189
KNOW WHETHER THE MAJORITY IS 

1196
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:14,592
STILL REQUIRING OF ALL OF THE 

1197
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:15,325
DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF THIS 

1198
00:38:15,325 --> 00:38:17,294
COMMITTEE TO PRECLEAR OF THE 

1199
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:17,861
QUESTIONS, DOCUMENTS, AND 

1200
00:38:17,861 --> 00:38:21,866
VIDEOS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO 

1201
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:24,134
USE AT THIS HEARING. 

1202
00:38:24,134 --> 00:38:26,670
>> IF THE -- I WAS HOPING THAT 

1203
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,639
ON THE SUBJECT THAT YOU JUST 

1204
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,909
BROUGHT UP THAT WE WOULD HAVE 

1205
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:35,012
SOME CLARIFICATION OF WHAT YOU 

1206
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:35,980
WANT TO APPROACH THAT. 

1207
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,548
AND I'M NOT PREPARED TO ANSWER 

1208
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:39,283
THAT QUESTION BECAUSE I DON'T 

1209
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:40,751
KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER HAS BEEN 

1210
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:43,421
AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO GIVE ME 

1211
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:45,689
WHAT YOU THINK THE ANSWER HAS 

1212
00:38:45,689 --> 00:38:47,858
BEEN OF DISCUSSION BETWEEN OUR 

1213
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:48,391
STAFF ON THAT SUBJECT. 

1214
00:38:48,391 --> 00:38:49,693
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I DON'T THINK 

1215
00:38:49,693 --> 00:38:51,161
IT'S EVER BEEN A CASE IN A 

1216
00:38:51,161 --> 00:38:53,097
HEARING LIKE THIS THAT THE 

1217
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,599
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE HAVE 

1218
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,103
TO PRECLEAR WHAT WE PROPOSE TO 

1219
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:00,470
QUERY THE NOMINEE ABOUT. 

1220
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,673
I THINK THAT IS TOTALLY 

1221
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:03,040
UNPRECEDENTED. 

1222
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,442
>> AND MR. CHAIRMAN, IF WE 

1223
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,143
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RULES ARE. 

1224
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:09,313
>> I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO 

1225
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:09,746
SENATOR HORANO. 

1226
00:39:09,746 --> 00:39:11,282
THE REASON WE'RE HAVING THAT 

1227
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:13,584
DISCUSSION IS, AT LEAST IN MY 

1228
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:15,986
TIME ON THIS COMMITTEE AND FOR 

1229
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:17,421
15 NOMINATIONS, WE'VE NEVER HAD 

1230
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:19,357
A REQUEST FOR A VIDEO. 

1231
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,559
SO I WOULD -- IT SEEMS TO ME TO 

1232
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,728
BE COURTEOUS TO ALL THE MEMBERS 

1233
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:24,628
OF THE COMMITTEE, IT WOULD BE 

1234
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:28,666
NICE TO KNOW THE PURPOSE AND 

1235
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:29,566
WHAT IT MIGHT CONTAIN. 

1236
00:39:29,566 --> 00:39:33,404
ANY QUESTIONS YOU WANT TO ASKS, 

1237
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:34,405
YOU CAN ASK QUESTIONS. 

1238
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:36,040
IT WASN'T ABOUT WHAT QUESTIONS 

1239
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,575
YOU WERE GOING TO ASK. 

1240
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:38,342
IT'S ABOUT THE PRESENTATION OF 

1241
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:39,877
SOMETHING THAT HAS NEVER BEEN A 

1242
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:46,584
PART OF THE SUPREME COURT 

1243
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:47,051
HEARING IN THE PAST. 

1244
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,820
I THINK I WILL BOMB BACK AND 

1245
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,053
FORTH. 

1246
00:39:50,053 --> 00:39:50,955
SENATOR TILLIS. 

1247
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:52,856
>> MR. L CHAIRMAN, I'M 

1248
00:39:52,856 --> 00:39:53,257
CONFUSED. 

1249
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:56,126
I HEARD THIS WAS A REACTION TO 

1250
00:39:56,126 --> 00:39:58,095
THE DOCUMENTS RELEASED LAST 

1251
00:39:58,095 --> 00:39:59,129
NIGHT. 

1252
00:39:59,129 --> 00:40:01,532
I'M REVIEWING A TWEET FROM NBC 

1253
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:02,666
THAT SAID DEMOCRATS PLOTTED 

1254
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:03,533
COORDINATED PROTEST STRATEGY 

1255
00:40:03,533 --> 00:40:04,901
OVER THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND ALL 

1256
00:40:04,901 --> 00:40:10,173
AGREE TODDIES RESPECT -- AGREED 

1257
00:40:10,173 --> 00:40:14,912
TO DISRUPT AND PROTEST THE 

1258
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:15,179
HEARING. 

1259
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:16,146
AND CHUCK SCHUMER LED A PHONE 

1260
00:40:16,146 --> 00:40:16,347
CALL. 

1261
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:18,682
SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR, NONE OF 

1262
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:20,518
THE MEMBERS ON THIS COMMITTEE 

1263
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,119
PARTICIPATED IN THAT PHONE CALL 

1264
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:23,821
OR STRATEGY BEFORE THE 

1265
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:24,821
DOCUMENTS WERE RELEASED 

1266
00:40:24,821 --> 00:40:25,155
YESTERDAY? 

1267
00:40:25,155 --> 00:40:27,858
ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT THIS 

1268
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:29,193
ALLEGATION IS FALSE? 

1269
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:31,228
>> THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS. 

1270
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:31,661
>> SENATOR DURBIN. 

1271
00:40:31,661 --> 00:40:32,829
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, THERE WAS A 

1272
00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:33,430
PHONE CONFERENCE YESTERDAY. 

1273
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,632
AND I CAN TELL YOU AT THE TIME 

1274
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:36,333
OF THE PHONE CONFERENCE, MANY 

1275
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,067
ISSUES WERE RAISED. 

1276
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:40,638
ONE OF THE ISSUES IS THE FACT 

1277
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:41,906
THAT OVER 100,000 DOCUMENTS 

1278
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:44,875
RELATED TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAVE 

1279
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:46,110
BEEN CHARACTERIZED AS COMMITTEE 

1280
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:46,443
CONFIDENTIAL. 

1281
00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:47,711
I'VE BEEN A MEMBER OF THIS 

1282
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:50,981
COMMITTEE FOR A NUMBER OF 

1283
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:51,214
YEARS. 

1284
00:40:51,214 --> 00:40:51,715
COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL 

1285
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:53,117
DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN REALLY 

1286
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,551
LIMITED TO EXTRAORDINARY 

1287
00:40:54,551 --> 00:40:54,918
CIRCUMSTANCES. 

1288
00:40:54,918 --> 00:40:56,220
AS AN EXAMPLE, IF SOMEONE IS 

1289
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,254
ACCUSED OF TAKING DRUGS DURING 

1290
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:58,856
THE COURSE OF AN INVESTIGATION 

1291
00:40:58,856 --> 00:40:59,857
AND I'M NOT MAKING ANY 

1292
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:00,958
SUGGESTION THAT IS EVEN THE 

1293
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,326
CASE OR CLOSE TO IT HERE. 

1294
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:05,262
IT WAS DONE IN A CONFIDENTIAL 

1295
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:05,796
SETTING. 

1296
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:06,529
IN FAIRNESS TO THE NOMINEE. 

1297
00:41:06,529 --> 00:41:13,537
AND THE SAME THING ON DUI'S AND 

1298
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:14,271
ALIKE. 

1299
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:15,005
WE USED AN EXTREMELY RARE 

1300
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:16,040
CIRCUMSTANCES WE WOULD MEET 

1301
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,541
AFTER THE HEARING AND RELATED 

1302
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:19,543
TO A HANDFUL OF PAGES OR 

1303
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:20,010
DOCUMENT REFERENCES. 

1304
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:20,978
INSTEAD WHAT WE FOUND NOW IS 

1305
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,514
THAT WE WERE SEEING HUNDREDS OF 

1306
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:25,683
THOUSANDS OF DOCUMENTS 

1307
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:28,218
CHARACTERIZED AS COMMITTEE 

1308
00:41:28,218 --> 00:41:28,785
CONFIDENTIAL UNILATERALLY. 

1309
00:41:28,785 --> 00:41:30,921
IT'S NOT DONE ON A BIPARTISAN 

1310
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:31,789
BASIS. 

1311
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:32,856
IT'S DONE AS A CHAIRMAN. 

1312
00:41:32,856 --> 00:41:34,524
THE WHOLE QUESTION OF WHETHER 

1313
00:41:34,524 --> 00:41:36,360
THIS COMMITTEE IS GOING TO HEAR 

1314
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,328
A NOMINEE FOR A LIFETIME 

1315
00:41:38,328 --> 00:41:39,096
APPOINTMENT TO THE HIGHERS 

1316
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:41,632
COURT IN THE LAND WITHOUT 

1317
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:45,069
ACCESS TO BASIC INFORMATION 

1318
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,570
ABOUT HIS PUBLIC RECORD. 

1319
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:47,237
HIS PUBLIC RECORD AS SECRETARY 

1320
00:41:47,237 --> 00:41:51,442
TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 

1321
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:51,675
STATES. 

1322
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:52,076
STAFF SECRETARY. 

1323
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:52,710
35 MONTHS OF PUBLIC SERVICE 

1324
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,544
WE'VE BEEN TOLD CANNOT BE 

1325
00:41:54,544 --> 00:41:54,845
CONSIDERED. 

1326
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:55,980
THE DOCUMENTS OF THAT SERVICE 

1327
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,747
CAN NOT BE CONSIDERED. 

1328
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:58,582
SO I WOULD SAY TO THE 

1329
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:00,351
GENTLEMAN, THE SENATOR FROM 

1330
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,519
NORTH CAROLINA, THERE WAS A 

1331
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:03,887
CONVERSATION YESTERDAY ABOUT 

1332
00:42:03,887 --> 00:42:04,287
THESE DOCUMENTS. 

1333
00:42:04,287 --> 00:42:06,523
I HAD NO IDEA THAT AT 11:00 

1334
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:07,224
LAST NIGHT 42,000 MORE 

1335
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:08,191
DOCUMENTS WOULD BE PUT ON TOP 

1336
00:42:08,191 --> 00:42:11,428
OF US AND WE'D BE ASKED TO TAKE 

1337
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:11,928
THEM UP TODAY. 

1338
00:42:11,928 --> 00:42:15,499
SO IT ADDED INSULT TO INJURY. 

1339
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:18,602
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I ASK TO BE 

1340
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:20,103
RECOGNIZE UNDER RULE FOUR. 

1341
00:42:20,103 --> 00:42:21,438
THE CHAIRMAN SHALL ENTERTAIN A 

1342
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:23,140
NOT DEBATABLE MOTION TO BRING A 

1343
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,976
MATTER BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TO 

1344
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:27,877
A VOTE IF THERE IS OBJECTION TO 

1345
00:42:27,877 --> 00:42:30,514
BRING THE MATTER TO A VOTE, A 

1346
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:32,249
ROLL CALL OF THE COMMITTEE 

1347
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:33,951
SHALL BE TAKEN AND DEBATE SHALL 

1348
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,519
BE TERMINATED IF THE MOTION TO 

1349
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,488
BRING THE MATTER TO A VOTE 

1350
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:38,154
WITHOUT FURTHER DEBATE PASSES 

1351
00:42:38,154 --> 00:42:41,358
WITH 11 VOTES IN THE 

1352
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:43,394
AFFIRMATIVE ONE OF WHICH MUST 

1353
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,361
BE CAST BY THE MINORITY. 

1354
00:42:45,361 --> 00:42:49,333
I ASK FOR A VOTE ON MY MOTION 

1355
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:52,036
TO ADJOURN UNDER RULE FOUR, MR. 

1356
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:52,336
CHAIRMAN. 

1357
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:55,338
THESE ARE RULES THAT WE ARE 

1358
00:42:55,338 --> 00:42:56,106
OBLIGATED TO FOLLOW. 

1359
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:58,108
THE CHAIRMAN HAS NO RIGHT, WITH 

1360
00:42:58,108 --> 00:43:02,246
ALL DUE RESPECT, TO SIMPLY OVER 

1361
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,947
RIDE THEM BY FIAT. 

1362
00:43:03,947 --> 00:43:06,083
>> WE ARE OBLIGATED, WE ARE 

1363
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:09,486
OBLIGATED BY THAT RULE IN 

1364
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:09,919
EXECUTIVE SESSION. 

1365
00:43:09,919 --> 00:43:19,095
WE'RE NOT IN EXECUTIVE SESSION. 

1366
00:43:19,095 --> 00:43:22,332
I WOULD RESPOND TO THE ISSUES 

1367
00:43:22,332 --> 00:43:26,136
BROUGHT UP BY SENATOR DURBIN 

1368
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:26,770
ABOUT CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENTS. 

1369
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:30,107
I WAS CRITICIZED FOR MY 

1370
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:33,177
DECISION TO RECEIVE SOME 

1371
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:34,078
DOCUMENTS ON COMMITTEE 

1372
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:34,812
CONFIDENTIAL. 

1373
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:40,918
BUT I'M DOING EXACTLY WHAT I 

1374
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:43,653
DID DURING JUDGE GORSUCH 

1375
00:43:43,653 --> 00:43:45,756
CONFIRMATION AND WHAT CHAIRMAN 

1376
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:47,925
LEAHY DID DURING JUDGE KASICHS. 

1377
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:49,526
THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF 

1378
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:50,093
TREATING REGULAR COMMITTEE 

1379
00:43:50,093 --> 00:43:52,329
PRACTICES OF SOMEHOW OUT OF THE 

1380
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:54,865
ORDINARY. 

1381
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:56,934
PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS THAT WE 

1382
00:43:56,934 --> 00:44:00,003
RECEIVE OFTEN CONTAIN HIGHLY 

1383
00:44:00,003 --> 00:44:01,037
SENSITIVE ADVICE TO THE 

1384
00:44:01,037 --> 00:44:06,110
PRESIDENT, AS WELL AS, PERSONAL 

1385
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:06,577
PRIVACY INFORMATION. 

1386
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:07,244
LIKE FULL NAMES, DATE OF BIRTH 

1387
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:11,048
AND SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS AND 

1388
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:12,515
BANK ACCOUNT NUMBERS. 

1389
00:44:12,515 --> 00:44:13,751
LIKE MY PREDECESSOR, AGREED TO 

1390
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:15,418
RECEIVE SOME PRESIDENTIAL 

1391
00:44:15,418 --> 00:44:16,220
RECORDS AS COMMITTEE 

1392
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,921
CONFIDENTIAL SO BOTH DEMOCRATS 

1393
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:19,757
AND REPUBLICNS COULD BEGIN 

1394
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,358
REVIEWING JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 

1395
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:22,492
MATERIALS MUCH EARLIER. 

1396
00:44:22,492 --> 00:44:25,229
I DON'T KNOW WHY MY DEMOCRAT 

1397
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:28,465
COLLEAGUES OBJECT TO RECEIVING 

1398
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:28,865
DOCUMENTS FASTER. 

1399
00:44:28,865 --> 00:44:32,069
BUT NOT ALL OF THESE 

1400
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:33,670
PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS REMAIN 

1401
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:34,104
CONFIDENTIAL. 

1402
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:36,240
IN FACT, NEARLY TWO-THIRDS 

1403
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:36,806
ALEADY BECAME PUBLIC. 

1404
00:44:36,806 --> 00:44:39,243
THESE RECORDS ARE POSTED ON THE 

1405
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:40,644
COMMITTEE'S PUBLIC WEBSITE AND 

1406
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:43,046
AVAILABLE TO THE AMERICAN 

1407
00:44:43,046 --> 00:44:43,947
PEOPLE. 

1408
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:46,350
AS A RESULT, WE PROVIDED 

1409
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,052
UNPRECEDENTED PUBLIC ACCESS TO 

1410
00:44:49,052 --> 00:44:50,286
A RECORD NUMBER OF PRESIDENTIAL 

1411
00:44:50,286 --> 00:44:52,355
RECORDS AND DID IT IN RECORD 

1412
00:44:52,355 --> 00:44:54,458
TIME. 

1413
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:57,027
THE MOST SENSITIVE PRESIDENTIAL 

1414
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,196
RECORDS REMAINS COMMITTEE 

1415
00:44:59,196 --> 00:44:59,863
CONFIDENTIAL UNDER FEDERAL LAW. 

1416
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:05,002
JUST AS THEY WERE DURING THE 

1417
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:07,370
NOMINATIONS OF KAY BEGIN OR 

1418
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:07,637
GORSUCH. 

1419
00:45:07,637 --> 00:45:09,139
BUT WE HAVE EXPANDED ACCESS TO 

1420
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:10,674
THESE DOCUMENTS ALSO INSTEAD OF 

1421
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:13,544
JUST PROVIDING ACCESS TO 

1422
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,511
COMMITTEE MEMBERS WE PROVIDED 

1423
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:16,946
ACCESS TO ALL 100 SENATORS. 

1424
00:45:16,946 --> 00:45:18,482
INSTEAD OF JUST PROVIDING 

1425
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:21,918
ACCESS TO A VERY FEW COMMITTEE 

1426
00:45:21,918 --> 00:45:24,755
AIDS, WE PROVIDED ACCESS TO ALL 

1427
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:25,989
COMMITTEE AIDS. 

1428
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:28,192
AND INSTEAD OF JUST PROVIDING 

1429
00:45:28,192 --> 00:45:31,361
ACCESS TO PHYSICAL BINDERS OF 

1430
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:34,865
PAPER, WE HAVE PROVIDED 24/7 

1431
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:37,000
DIGITAL AND SEARCHABLE ACCESS. 

1432
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,703
THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED ACCESS TO 

1433
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:40,671
COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL 

1434
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:41,238
MATERIAL. 

1435
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:43,207
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT 

1436
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:45,909
MY STAFF SET UP WORKSTATIONS 

1437
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:48,478
AND HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE 24/7 TO 

1438
00:45:48,478 --> 00:45:54,184
HELP SENATORS THAT ARE NOT ON 

1439
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:54,918
COMMITTEE ACCESS CONFIDENTIAL 

1440
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,287
MATERIALS, BUT NOT ONE SENATOR 

1441
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:57,587
SHOWED UP. 

1442
00:45:57,587 --> 00:46:00,791
I GUESS SENATORS COMPLAINING 

1443
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:05,028
ABOUT LACK OF ACCESS TO 

1444
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:05,695
CONTINUE CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENTS 

1445
00:46:05,695 --> 00:46:06,429
WON'T BE INTERESTED IN SEEING 

1446
00:46:06,429 --> 00:46:08,131
THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. 

1447
00:46:08,131 --> 00:46:10,267
I WANT TO EMPHASIZE MORE 

1448
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,135
DOCUMENTS ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE 

1449
00:46:12,135 --> 00:46:15,372
THAN IN ANY PRIOR SUPREME COURT 

1450
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:16,306
NOMINATION. 

1451
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:20,911
AND THEN TO THE ISSUE ABOUT 

1452
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:21,645
HIDING COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL 

1453
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:22,045
DOCUMENTS. 

1454
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:23,480
SOME COLLEAGUES AND YOU'VE 

1455
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,049
HEARD IT THIS MORNING ACCUSED 

1456
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:26,783
OF HIDING DOCUMENTS. 

1457
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:28,886
THEY ARE SUGGESTING THAT SOME 

1458
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:30,787
OF THE COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL 

1459
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:31,488
DOCUMENTS CONTAIN INFORMATION 

1460
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:34,024
THAT WOULD BE OF GREAT INTEREST 

1461
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:34,457
TO THE PUBLIC. 

1462
00:46:34,457 --> 00:46:37,995
WELL, JUST AS I DID LAST YEAR 

1463
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:39,429
DURING JUSTICE GORSUCH'S 

1464
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:41,164
CONFIRMATION, I PUT A PROCESS 

1465
00:46:41,164 --> 00:46:43,567
IN PLACE THAT WOULD ALLOW MY 

1466
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:46,236

AND SECURED THE RELEASE OF FOUR 

1481
00:47:13,563 --> 00:47:14,531
DOCUMENTS THIS YEAR. 

1482
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:17,267
IF MY COLLEAGUES TRULY BELIEVE 

1483
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:18,001
THAT OTHER COMMITTEE 

1484
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,436
CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENTS 

1485
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:21,371
SHOULDN'T BE MADE PUBLIC, THEY 

1486
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:22,639
NEVER TOLD ME ABOUT THEM AND 

1487
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:25,609
REQUEST THE ONES THAT THEY 

1488
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:25,842

1489
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:27,611
INSTEAD OF SCARING THE AMERICAN 

1490
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:30,447
PEOPLE BY SUGGESTING THAT WE'RE 

1491
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:31,180
HIDING SOME INCRIMINATING 

1492
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:32,249
DOCUMENTS, THEY SHOULD HAVE 

1493
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:36,420
MADE A REQUEST THAT I WORK TO 

1494
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,255
GET THE COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL 

1495
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:39,355
DESIGNATION REMOVED. 

1496
00:47:39,355 --> 00:47:44,995
THIS YEAR I RECEIVED NO SUCH 

1497
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:45,962
REQUEST EXPECT FROM SENATOR 

1498
00:47:45,962 --> 00:47:47,130
CLOBERCHAR WHICH WAS HONORED IN 

1499
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,433
THE DOCUMENTS THAT SHE WANTED 

1500
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:50,867
TO USE DURING THIS HEARING. 

1501
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:52,669
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, YOU STATED 

1502
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:55,338
WHAT I DID AND YOU STATED 

1503
00:47:55,338 --> 00:47:55,672
INACCURATELY. 

1504
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,474
I THINK I HAVE THE RIGHT. 

1505
00:47:57,474 --> 00:48:01,612
>> I SAID I WAS PARAPHRASING 

1506
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:01,778
IT. 

1507
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:04,281
YOU CAN CORRECT ME WHATEVER YOU 

1508
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:04,481
WANT. 

1509
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:06,750
>> IT WAS ONE HECK OF A 

1510
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:07,684
PARAPHRASES. 

1511
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:12,756
WHEN YOU SPEAK ABOUT DOING THE 

1512
00:48:12,756 --> 00:48:15,259
SAME THING WITH SENATOR KAGAN. 

1513
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:18,028
I WAS CHAIRMAN WHEN KAGAN WAS 

1514
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:18,562
HERE. 

1515
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,130
WE HAD 19% OF HER RECORDS FROM 

1516
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:26,103
THE WHITE HOUSE WERE MADE 

1517
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:28,805
PUBLIC 12 DAYS, 12 DAYS BEFORE 

1518
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:30,306
THE HEARING. 

1519
00:48:30,306 --> 00:48:32,809
WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH WE HAVE 7% 

1520
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:34,010
AND ONLY 4% ARE PUBLIC. 

1521
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:39,316
YOU CAN TALK ABOUT NUMBER OF 

1522
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:41,118
PAGES, THE FACT IS 99% FOR 

1523
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:49,059
KAGAN 12 DAYS BEFORE THE 

1524
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:49,326
HEARING. 

1525
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:51,128
IT WAS ALL AVAILABLE. 

1526
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:54,931
JUDGE KAVANAUGH 7% AND ONLY 4% 

1527
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:55,264
MADE PUBLIC. 

1528
00:48:55,264 --> 00:48:58,368
SO IF WE'RE GOING TO ARGUE WHAT 

1529
00:48:58,368 --> 00:48:59,869
WAS PRECEDENT, I WOULD POINT 

1530
00:48:59,869 --> 00:49:04,007
OUT THAT I'VE BEEN IN THE 

1531
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:07,711
SENATE FOR 19 SUPREME COURT 

1532
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:08,044
NOMINATIONS. 

1533
00:49:08,044 --> 00:49:10,414
WHAT IS BEING DONE HERE IS 

1534
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:10,747
UNPRECEDENT. 

1535
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:12,416
AND I KEEP COMING BACK TO THE 

1536
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:14,117
SAME QUESTION I ASKED. 

1537
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:16,953
WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO HIDE? 

1538
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:18,655
WHAT ARE WE HIDING? 

1539
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:19,422
WHAT IS BEING HIDDEN? 

1540
00:49:19,422 --> 00:49:23,693
WHY NOT HAVE IT OPEN LIKE ALL 

1541
00:49:23,693 --> 00:49:24,127
OTHERS? 

1542
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:32,235
ONLY OTHER TIME WE HEARD A 

1543
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:37,707
PRESIDENT INVOKE EXECUTIVE 

1544
00:49:37,707 --> 00:49:40,310
PRIVILEGE WAS PRESIDENT REAGAN. 

1545
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:44,781
WINTERMAN SAID DON'T DO THAT. 

1546
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:45,515
HE SAID OKAY. 

1547
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:45,882
YOU'RE RIGHT. 

1548
00:49:45,882 --> 00:49:49,419
AND HE WITHDREW HIS REQUEST OF 

1549
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:51,888
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE AND 

1550
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:56,393
RELEASED THE DOCUMENTS. 

1551
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:58,527
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 

1552
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:03,100
>> I'M JUST SORRY TO SEE THE 

1553
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,234
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 

1554
00:50:05,234 --> 00:50:06,436
DESCEND THIS WAY. 

1555
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:09,005
I FELT PRIVILEGED TO SERVE HERE 

1556
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:10,040
UNDER REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC 

1557
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,276
LEADERSHIP FOR OVER 40 YEARS. 

1558
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:15,178
THIS IS NOT THE SENATE 

1559
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,279
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE I SAW WHEN 

1560
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:18,648
I CAME TO THE U.S. SENATE. 

1561
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:19,850
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, MY NAME WAS 

1562
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,518
INVOKED BY YOU. 

1563
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:22,018
CAN I PLEASE RESPOND? 

1564
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:23,819
>> AFTER I GET DONE. 

1565
00:50:23,819 --> 00:50:27,290
I WANT TO GIVE THE EXACT QUOTE 

1566
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:28,591
I WAS PARAPHRASING. 

1567
00:50:28,591 --> 00:50:31,727
CHAIRMAN LEAHY SAID QUOTE, WE 

1568
00:50:31,727 --> 00:50:32,528
HAVE JUDGE SOTOMAYOR'S RECORD 

1569
00:50:32,528 --> 00:50:34,464
FROM THE FEDERAL BENCH. 

1570
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:37,767
THAT IS A PUBLIC RECORD WE HAD 

1571
00:50:37,767 --> 00:50:43,140
EVEN BEFORE SHE WAS DESIGNATED 

1572
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,240
BY THE PRESIDENT. 

1573
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:44,774
JUDGE SOTOMAYO JUDICIAL 

1574
00:50:44,774 --> 00:50:46,977
RESTRAINT AND MODESTY IS THE 

1575
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:48,545
BEST INDICATION OF HER JUDICIAL 

1576
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:48,845
PHILOSOPHY. 

1577
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:50,547
WE DO NOT HAVE TO IMAGINE WHAT 

1578
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,982
KIND OF A JUDGE SHE WILL BE 

1579
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:55,552
BECAUSE WE SEE WHAT KIND OF A 

1580
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:58,088
JUDGE SHE HAS BEEN. 

1581
00:50:58,088 --> 00:51:04,227
SO THAT IS WHY MY ANSWER TO THE 

1582
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,061
GOLD STANDARD OF WHETHER 

1583
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:08,498
SENATOR KAVANAUGH OUGHT TO BE 

1584
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:10,466
ON THE SUPREME COURT BASED UPON 

1585
00:51:10,466 --> 00:51:11,901
WHAT DEMOCRATS THEMSELVES HAVE 

1586
00:51:11,901 --> 00:51:13,036
SAID IS THE BEST JUDGE OF 

1587
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:16,973
WHETHER YOU SHOULD BE ON THE 

1588
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:17,573
SUPREME COURT. 

1589
00:51:17,573 --> 00:51:19,909
SENATOR CLOBBER CHUCK. 

1590
00:51:19,909 --> 00:51:33,790
>> YOU MENTIONED WHAT I SAID. 

1591
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:39,362
BUT YOU NEGLECT TO MENTION,  

1592
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:42,465
CAREFULLY NEGLECT TO MENTION 

1593
00:51:42,465 --> 00:51:46,970
THAT REPUBLICANS ASKED FOR FOUR 

1594
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:48,538
MINUTES FROM HER -- BOARD 

1595
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:51,675
MINUTES FROM HER WORK IN THE 

1596
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:51,975
1980s. 

1597
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:53,309
LONG BEFORE SHE WAS CONSIDERED 

1598
00:51:53,309 --> 00:51:53,810
AS A JUDGE. 

1599
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,012
YOU ASKED FOR THAT AND WE GOT 

1600
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:58,280
IT FOR YOU. 

1601
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:58,681
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 

1602
00:51:58,681 --> 00:52:04,053
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, YOU CALLED ON 

1603
00:52:04,053 --> 00:52:04,321
ME. 

1604
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:06,823
>> BEFORE SENATOR CLOBBER CHEER 

1605
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:07,390
SPEAKS. 

1606
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:08,325
WE HAVE 488,000 PAGES OF 

1607
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:10,227
DOCUMENTS. 

1608
00:52:10,227 --> 00:52:11,394
GO AHEAD SENATOR. 

1609
00:52:11,394 --> 00:52:13,663
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. L 

1610
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:14,197
CHAIRMAN. 

1611
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:15,532
A FEW POINTS HERE. 

1612
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:16,232
NUMBER ONE JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR 

1613
00:52:16,232 --> 00:52:18,435
NEVER WORKED IN THE WHITE HOUSE 

1614
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:22,405
SO NONE OF THESE ISSUES OF 

1615
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:23,106
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGES ARE 

1616
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:23,974
RELEVANT. 

1617
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,108
NUMBER TWO MILE I APPRECIATE 

1618
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:27,110
YOU GRANTING MY REQUEST MR. 

1619
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,078
CHAIRMAN, ON THESE CAMPAIGN 

1620
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:29,813
FINANCE DOCUMENTS, THIS IS ALL 

1621
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:30,113
THEY WERE. 

1622
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:30,413
THIS IS IT. 

1623
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:33,916
THIS IS HOW MANY PAGES. 

1624
00:52:33,916 --> 00:52:35,051
YET, WE HAVE 148,000 DOCUMENTS 

1625
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:37,053
THAT WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT 

1626
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:37,353
PUBLICLY. 

1627
00:52:37,353 --> 00:52:39,389
AND I WILL SAY THEY ARE 

1628
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:39,789
ILLUMINATING. 

1629
00:52:39,789 --> 00:52:43,059
IT SHOWS THE NOMINEE HAS A 

1630
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:44,660
LIMITED VIEW OF CAMPAIGN 

1631
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,463
FINANCE REFORM IN HIS OWN WORDS 

1632
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:48,465
HE SAYS THAT HIS VIEWS ON THE 

1633
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:49,833
FIRST AMENDMENT ARE PURE WHEN 

1634
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,002
IT COMES TO THIS VERY IMPORTANT 

1635
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:52,335
ISSUE. 

1636
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,837
AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT MORE 

1637
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:54,270
IN THE FUTURE. 

1638
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:56,205
BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION AND 

1639
00:52:56,205 --> 00:52:58,975
THAT IS THAT YES, I ASKED FOR 

1640
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:00,677
THESE DOCUMENTS, BUFF I HAVE 

1641
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,978
JOINED SEVERAL LETTERS LED BY 

1642
00:53:02,978 --> 00:53:03,646
SENATOR FEINSTEINASKING THAT 

1643
00:53:03,646 --> 00:53:05,014
ALL THE DOCUMENTS THAT WE HAVE 

1644
00:53:05,014 --> 00:53:06,482
IN THE COMMITTEE BE MADE PUBLIC 

1645
00:53:06,482 --> 00:53:09,986
SO THAT WE CAN ASK QUESTIONS. 

1646
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:11,621
AND THEN FINALLY MY INITIAL 

1647
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:13,790
POINT I'M SO FOCUSED ON THE 

1648
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:17,227
102,000 PAGES OF DOCUMENTS FROM 

1649
00:53:17,227 --> 00:53:23,900
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S WORK IN THE 

1650
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,836
WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL -- IF YOU 

1651
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:29,673
HAVE ANOTHER EXAMPLE TO BLOCK 

1652
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:31,675
THE RELEASE DURING THE SUPREME 

1653
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:32,175
COURT NOMINATION. 

1654
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:37,346
AS FAR AS MY RESEARCH SHOWS, 

1655
00:53:37,346 --> 00:53:39,749
THIS WASN'T DONE FOR JUSTICE 

1656
00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:40,283
KAGAN OR REPORTERS. 

1657
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:43,453
AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF YOU 

1658
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:45,488
HAVE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS. 

1659
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:47,990
>> IT WAS DONE BY JUSTICE 

1660
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:48,325
ROBERTS. 

1661
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:49,359
>> WHEN SHE WAS A SOLICITOR 

1662
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:49,893
GENERAL. 

1663
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,194
BUT DURING THE TIME THEY WORKED 

1664
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:52,462
IN THE WHITE HOUSE. 

1665
00:53:52,462 --> 00:53:54,064
THAT IS MY QUESTION. 

1666
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,231
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I WOULD LIKE 

1667
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:57,467
TO BRING TO THE ATTENTION OF 

1668
00:53:57,467 --> 00:53:57,867
THE CHAIR. 

1669
00:53:57,867 --> 00:54:00,203
>> I BELIEVE I HAD THE FLOOR. 

1670
00:54:00,203 --> 00:54:03,239
>> THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN FOR 

1671
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:03,739
RECOGNIZING ME. 

1672
00:54:03,739 --> 00:54:05,742
I HAVEN'T BEEN IN AS MANY 

1673
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:06,810
CONFIRMATION HEARINGS AS SOME 

1674
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:11,214
OF MY COLLEAGUES, BUT THIS IS 

1675
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:13,917
THE FIRST CONFIRMATION HEARING 

1676
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,652
FOR A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE 

1677
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:16,452
I'VE SEEN ACCORDING TO MOB 

1678
00:54:16,452 --> 00:54:16,652
RULE. 

1679
00:54:16,652 --> 00:54:19,155
WE HAVE RULES IN THE SENATE. 

1680
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:24,561
WE HAVE RULES ISN'T THE GNAT. 

1681
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:29,766
WE HAVE NORMS FOR DECORUM . YOU 

1682
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:32,435
HAVE GIVEN THEM A CHANCE TO ASK 

1683
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:33,836
QUESTIONS FOR 50 MINUTES. 

1684
00:54:33,836 --> 00:54:34,838
EVERY ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES CAN 

1685
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:36,506
STEP OUT HERE AND TALK TO THE 

1686
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:37,239
PRESS AND MAKE WHATEVER 

1687
00:54:37,239 --> 00:54:38,441
COMMENTS THEY WANT TO THE PRESS 

1688
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:40,043
AND TELL THE WORLD HOW THEY 

1689
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:40,577
FEEL ABOUT THIS. 

1690
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:42,479
BUT THE FACT IS, IT'S HARD TO 

1691
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:45,749
TAKE IT SERIOUSLY WHEN EVERY 

1692
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:47,483
SINGLE ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES IN 

1693
00:54:47,483 --> 00:54:49,586
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 

1694
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:51,220
HAVE ANNOUNCED THEIR OPPOSITION 

1695
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:53,723
TO THIS NOMINEE EVEN BEFORE 

1696
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:54,123
TODAY'S HEARING. 

1697
00:54:54,123 --> 00:54:56,458
SO IT'S HARD TO TAKE SERIOUS 

1698
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:57,727
ISLY THEIR CLAIM THAT SOMEHOW 

1699
00:54:57,727 --> 00:55:00,296
THEY CAN'T DO THEIR JOB BECAUSE 

1700
00:55:00,296 --> 00:55:02,999
THEY HAVE BEEN DENIED ACCESS TO 

1701
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:04,033
ATTORNEY CLIENT OR EXECUTIVE 

1702
00:55:04,033 --> 00:55:04,734
PRIVILEGE DOCUMENTS WHEN THEY 

1703
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:06,402
HAVE MADE UP THEIR MIND BEFORE 

1704
00:55:06,402 --> 00:55:06,736
THE HEARING. 

1705
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:08,238
THERE IS NOTHING FAIR ABOUT 

1706
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:08,438
THAT. 

1707
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:10,506
AND WE WOULD JUST ASK FOR AN 

1708
00:55:10,506 --> 00:55:11,373
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE AMERICAN 

1709
00:55:11,373 --> 00:55:14,477
PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO LISTEN TO 

1710
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,078
THIS NOMINEE APPS THE QUESTIONS 

1711
00:55:16,078 --> 00:55:16,579
THAT WE HAVE. 

1712
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:18,347
AND I THINK THAT IS HOW WE 

1713
00:55:18,347 --> 00:55:19,648
OUGHT TO PROCEED. 

1714
00:55:19,648 --> 00:55:20,917
I HOPE WE WILL. 

1715
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:22,852
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, CAN I BE 

1716
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:23,887
RECOGNIZED TO RESPOND 

1717
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:25,154
SPECIFICALLY TO THAT COMMENT? 

1718
00:55:25,154 --> 00:55:25,822
THERE IS PRECEDENT HERE. 

1719
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,189
THERE ARE RULES THAT CAN GUIDE 

1720
00:55:27,189 --> 00:55:27,356
US. 

1721
00:55:27,356 --> 00:55:30,627
WE'RE ASKING FOR THOSE RULES TO 

1722
00:55:30,627 --> 00:55:31,160
BE FOLLOWED. 

1723
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,996
IN THE PAST, OUR COLLEAGUES ON 

1724
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:36,533
THE REPUBLICAN SIDE HAVE ASKED 

1725
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:38,735
FOR A POSTPONEMENT OF THESE 

1726
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:41,671
COMMITTEE PROCEEDINGS ON 

1727
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:43,373
NOMINATIONS WHEN DOCUMENTS HAVE 

1728
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:45,774
BEEN DENIED ON TWO OCCASIONS 

1729
00:55:45,774 --> 00:55:47,510
FROM SENATOR SESSIONS FROM THEN 

1730
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:51,314
SENATOR SESSIONS AND SENATOR 

1731
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:52,048
KYLE. 

1732
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:53,315
THOSE REQUESTS WERE GRANTED. 

1733
00:55:53,315 --> 00:55:55,251
WE'RE ASKING SIMPLY THAT, THAT 

1734
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:57,153
PRECEDENT BE FOLLOWED, MR. 

1735
00:55:57,153 --> 00:55:57,720
CHAIRMAN. 

1736
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,489
FAR FROM MOB RULE, FAR FROM 

1737
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:01,056
CONTEMPT OF THE PROCESS. 

1738
00:56:01,056 --> 00:56:02,892
WE'RE SIMPLY ASKING FOR RESPECT 

1739
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:07,997
HERE TO THE NORMAL REGULAR 

1740
00:56:07,997 --> 00:56:08,331
ORDER. 

1741
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:09,098
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 

1742
00:56:09,098 --> 00:56:09,432
>> GO AHEAD. 

1743
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:11,434
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I WOULD LIKE 

1744
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:12,568
TO ADDRESS THIS COMMITTEE 

1745
00:56:12,568 --> 00:56:13,937
CONFIDENTIAL ISSUE ONE MORE 

1746
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:14,337
TIME. 

1747
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:15,472
YOU HAVE EXPLAINED YOUR POINT 

1748
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:17,273
OF VIEW. 

1749
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:18,575
HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW. 

1750
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:21,044
THE CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY WHO IS MY 

1751
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:25,882
FRIEND AND I RESPECT SAYS HIS 

1752
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,116
REASON FOR DESIGNATED 147,000 

1753
00:56:27,116 --> 00:56:28,418
PAGES AS COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL 

1754
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:29,885
BECAUSE THAT WAS THE CONDITION 

1755
00:56:29,885 --> 00:56:33,322
THAT BILL BURKE IMPOSED ON THE 

1756
00:56:33,322 --> 00:56:34,057
PROVISION OF THE DOCUMENTS. 

1757
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,357
WHEN JUDGE KAVANAUGH WAS IN MY 

1758
00:56:35,357 --> 00:56:38,394
OFFICE, MEETING WITH US, I 

1759
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:40,696
ASKED HIM WHO IS BILL BURKE? 

1760
00:56:40,696 --> 00:56:42,866
BY WHAT AUTHORITY CAN HE 

1761
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:44,534
RESTRICT THE INFORMATION GIVEN 

1762
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:45,401
TO THE SENATE JUDICIARY 

1763
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:47,103
COMMITTEE TO THE AMERICAN 

1764
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:48,304
PEOPLE? 

1765
00:56:48,304 --> 00:56:50,239
IS HE A GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE? 

1766
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:51,608
NO ONE KNEW THIS MYSTERIOUS 

1767
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:53,476
BILL BURKE WHO IS FILTERING 

1768
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:53,943
THESE DOCUMENTS. 

1769
00:56:53,943 --> 00:56:55,177
I FIGURED SINCE THE NOMINEE 

1770
00:56:55,177 --> 00:56:57,013
CARRIES A CONSTITUTION IN HIS 

1771
00:56:57,013 --> 00:56:58,581
POCKET, THERE MUST BE SOME 

1772
00:56:58,581 --> 00:56:59,582
REFERENCE TO BILL BURKE. 

1773
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,084
IN ARTICLE TWO, SECTION TWO. 

1774
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,719
BUT IT JUST SAYS ADVICE AND 

1775
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,220
CONSENT OF THE SENATE. 

1776
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:05,087
IT DOESN'T INCLUDE MR. BURKE. 

1777
00:57:05,087 --> 00:57:06,722
BY WHAT AUTHORITY IS THIS MAN 

1778
00:57:06,722 --> 00:57:08,157
HOLDING BACK HUNDREDS OF 

1779
00:57:08,157 --> 00:57:11,161
THOUSANDS OF DOCUMENTS FROM THE 

1780
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:11,561
AMERICAN PEOPLE? 

1781
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:12,761
WHO IS HE? 

1782
00:57:12,761 --> 00:57:14,063
WHO IS PAYING HIM? 

1783
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:15,798
SO COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL IS 

1784
00:57:15,798 --> 00:57:17,233
BEING DETERMINED BY A MAN, A 

1785
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:18,968
PRIVATE ATTORNEY, AND WE DON'T 

1786
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:21,738
KNOW WHO HE WORKS FOR, OR WHO 

1787
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:22,338
HE IS ACCOUNTABLE TO. 

1788
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:24,474
MR. CHAIRMAN, IN THE PAST WHEN 

1789
00:57:24,474 --> 00:57:25,642
WE WENT INTO COMMITTEE 

1790
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:27,744
CONFIDENTIAL, IT WAS IN A 

1791
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:29,312
DISCREET, SPECIFIC AREA OF 

1792
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:32,248
CONCERN INVOLVING A HANDFUL OF 

1793
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:32,481
WORDS. 

1794
00:57:32,481 --> 00:57:33,716
OR ACCUSATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN 

1795
00:57:33,716 --> 00:57:34,583
MADE IN A DOCUMENT. 

1796
00:57:34,583 --> 00:57:37,820
WE WERE CAREFUL TO DO IT ON A 

1797
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:38,253
BIPARTISAN BASIS. 

1798
00:57:38,253 --> 00:57:41,291
THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE 

1799
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,559
HERE. 

1800
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:43,426
WHERE 140,000 CASES HAVE BEEN 

1801
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:44,193
DESIGNATED BY BILL BURKE IS 

1802
00:57:44,193 --> 00:57:47,130
OUTSIDE OF THE REACH OF THE 

1803
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:47,530
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

1804
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:48,865
THAT IS A FURTHER EXAMPLE OF 

1805
00:57:48,865 --> 00:57:51,801
WHY THIS WHOLE PROCESS HAS GONE 

1806
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:52,034
ASTRAY. 

1807
00:57:52,034 --> 00:57:56,506
I THINK YOUR EXPLANATION 

1808
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:56,839
IGNORES THAT. 

1809
00:57:56,839 --> 00:57:57,339
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 

1810
00:57:57,339 --> 00:57:59,742
>> WHO WANTS THE FLOOR? 

1811
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:01,611
>> THE NEW SENATOR. 

1812
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:05,014
>> GO AHEAD. 

1813
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:06,548
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

1814
00:58:06,548 --> 00:58:12,589
CAN YOU TELL ME AGAIN HOW MANY 

1815
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:16,025
DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN PRODUCED. 

1816
00:58:16,025 --> 00:58:19,394
>> 488,000 OTHER THAN 28,000 

1817
00:58:19,394 --> 00:58:21,964
PAGES THAT JUSTICE KAVANAUGH 

1818
00:58:21,964 --> 00:58:24,233
HAS SOME HEADED INCLUDING HIS 

1819
00:58:24,233 --> 00:58:25,134
OWN JUDICIAL OPINIONS. 

1820
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:26,970
>> NUMBER TWO, ARE WE IN 

1821
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:27,837
EXECUTIVE SESSION OR NOT? 

1822
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:30,907
>> WE'RE HAVING A HEARING ON 

1823
00:58:30,907 --> 00:58:32,641
THE NOMINATION OF A NOMINEE FOR 

1824
00:58:32,641 --> 00:58:33,075
THE SUPREME COURT. 

1825
00:58:33,075 --> 00:58:35,244
>> YES, SIR I GOT THAT. 

1826
00:58:35,244 --> 00:58:37,113
>> WE'RE NOT IN EXECUTIVE 

1827
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:37,380
SESSION. 

1828
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:38,414
>> AT NUMBER THREE,S AT SOME 

1829
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:40,549
POINT WILL WE GET TO HEAR FROM 

1830
00:58:40,549 --> 00:58:41,016
THE NOMINEE? 

1831
00:58:41,016 --> 00:58:43,119
>> HOPEFULLY IT WAS GOING TO BE 

1832
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:43,452
BEFORE 2:30. 

1833
00:58:43,452 --> 00:58:45,655
IT WILL PROBABLY BE LATER THIS 

1834
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:48,324
AFTERNOON NOW. 

1835
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:49,858
>> THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 

1836
00:58:49,858 --> 00:58:50,559
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 

1837
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:53,096
>> CAN I ASK MY COLLEAGUES ON 

1838
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:54,831
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE HOW 

1839
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:59,202
LONG YOU WANT TO GO ON WITH 

1840
00:58:59,202 --> 00:58:59,402
THIS? 

1841
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:00,303
I'M NOT GOING TO ENTERTAIN ANY 

1842
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:02,405
OF THE MOTIONS YOU ARE MAKE. 

1843
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:03,639
WE'RE NOT IN EXECUTIVE SESSION. 

1844
00:59:03,639 --> 00:59:05,875
AND I THINK WE OUGHT TO LEVEL 

1845
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:06,709
WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

1846
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,443
DO YOU WANT THIS TO GO ON ALL 

1847
00:59:08,443 --> 00:59:08,978
DAY? 

1848
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:11,780
BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN PATIENT. 

1849
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:12,949
I'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF HAVING A 

1850
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:14,416
MOB RULE SESSION. 

1851
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:15,985
NOW IF WE HAVE A MOB RULE 

1852
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:17,086
SESSION, IT'S BECAUSE THE 

1853
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:19,989
CHAIRMAN'S NOT RUNNING THE 

1854
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:20,422
COMMITTEE PROPERLY. 

1855
00:59:20,422 --> 00:59:21,991
BUT SINCE EVERY ONE OF YOU ON 

1856
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:24,160
THAT SIDE OF THE AISLE EXPECT 

1857
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,129
FOR SENATOR BOOKER, SENATOR 

1858
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:28,364
HARRIS NEW TO THE COMMITTEE 

1859
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:29,532
SAID DURING JUSTICE GORSUCH 

1860
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:30,800
HEARING, EVERY ONE OF YOU 

1861
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,400
PREFERENCED YOUR COMMENTS ON 

1862
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:35,271
HOW FAIR I WAS IN RUNNING THAT 

1863
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:35,538
HEARING. 

1864
00:59:35,538 --> 00:59:36,873
NOW THIS IS THE SAME CHUCK 

1865
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:38,441
GRASSLEY THAT RAN THE GORSUCH 

1866
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:38,708
HEARING. 

1867
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:39,442
I WOULD LIKE TO RUN THIS 

1868
00:59:39,442 --> 00:59:41,144
HEARING THE SAME WAY IF YOU 

1869
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:43,279
WILL GIVE ME THE COURTESY OF 

1870
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:43,546
DOING IT. 

1871
00:59:43,546 --> 00:59:43,913
>> THANK YOU. 

1872
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,648
>> HOW LONG DO YOU WANT TO GO 

1873
00:59:45,648 --> 00:59:45,814
ON? 

1874
00:59:45,814 --> 00:59:48,117
>> I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ONE 

1875
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:50,018
MORE POINT BEFORE WE PROCEED. 

1876
00:59:50,018 --> 00:59:50,820
THE ACCUSATION THAT THIS IS A 

1877
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,655
MOB RULE HEARING WAS MADE BY 

1878
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:54,691
YOUR COLLEAGUE FROM THE STATE 

1879
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:54,991
OF TEXAS. 

1880
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:56,359
I THINK YOU HAVE BEEN 

1881
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:57,794
CONDUCTING THIS IN A 

1882
00:59:57,794 --> 00:59:58,661
RESPECTFUL, APPROPRIATE, AND 

1883
00:59:58,661 --> 00:59:59,128
DELIBERATE WAY. 

1884
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:00,496
MY CONCERNS THAT I WANT TO 

1885
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:02,431
RENEW GIVEN THE EXCHANGE YOU 

1886
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:06,302
JUST HAD WITH SENATOR LEAHY WHO 

1887
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:07,737
HAS PARTICIPATED IN OR PRESIDED 

1888
01:00:07,737 --> 01:00:10,173
OVER ANY MORE CURRENTLY SERVING 

1889
01:00:10,173 --> 01:00:12,709
MEMBER I BELIEVE WAS OVER HOW 

1890
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:14,744
THE DOCUMENT REQUEST WAS 

1891
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:16,112
HANDLED FOR NOW JUSTICE KAGAN. 

1892
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:18,681
A REQUEST WAS SENT TO THE 

1893
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:19,114
NATIONAL ARCHIVES. 

1894
01:00:19,114 --> 01:00:20,616
RANKING MEMBER FEINSTEIN TRIED 

1895
01:00:20,616 --> 01:00:23,986
TO WORK WITH YOU TO SEND AN 

1896
01:00:23,986 --> 01:00:25,521
IDENTICAL REQUEST TO THE 

1897
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:25,954
NATIONAL ARCHIVES. 

1898
01:00:25,954 --> 01:00:28,090
AND BEFORE WE PROCEED WITH THE 

1899
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:28,724
QUESTIONING, MR. CHAIRMAN, I 

1900
01:00:28,724 --> 01:00:33,463
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A SETTLED 

1901
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:35,364
HEART WHY YOU CHOSE TO DIRECTLY 

1902
01:00:35,364 --> 01:00:36,466
COMMUNICATE TO THE ARCHIVES AND 

1903
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,768
NOT RESPOND TO THE RANKING 

1904
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:39,334
MEMBERS REQUEST. 

1905
01:00:39,334 --> 01:00:41,604
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE HAVE 

1906
01:00:41,604 --> 01:00:42,938
RAISED ISSUES ABOUT AN 

1907
01:00:42,938 --> 01:00:44,307
UNPRECEDENTED COMMITTEE PROCESS 

1908
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:45,575
BY ALCOHOL DOCUMENTS WERE 

1909
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:47,343
BLOCKED, BY WHICH THEY WERE 

1910
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:48,444
CONSIDERED CLASSIFIED, AND BY 

1911
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:49,946
WHICH WE HAVE BEEN BLOCKED FROM 

1912
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:53,382
BEING ABLE TO CHAIR THEM WITH 

1913
01:00:53,382 --> 01:00:54,951
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OR ASK 

1914
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:56,352
QUESTIONS BASED ON THEM. 

1915
01:00:56,352 --> 01:00:57,487
THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED. 

1916
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:01,123
THAT IS WHY AS YOU PUT IT THIS 

1917
01:01:01,123 --> 01:01:02,592
SIDE SEEKS TO RAISE HERB EWES 

1918
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:04,093
TO ESTABLISH GROUND RULES 

1919
01:01:04,093 --> 01:01:06,061
BEFORE WE PROCEED. 

1920
01:01:06,061 --> 01:01:07,897
>> YOU ASKED AN APPROPRIATE 

1921
01:01:07,897 --> 01:01:08,164
QUESTION. 

1922
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:09,064
I HAVE AN ANSWER. 

1923
01:01:09,064 --> 01:01:14,303
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL SATISFY 

1924
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:14,804
YOU OR NOT. 

1925
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:17,206
THOSE DOCUMENTS ARE THE LEAST 

1926
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:18,541
USEFUL IN UNDERSTANDING HIS 

1927
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:20,209
LEGAL VIEWS AND THE MOST 

1928
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:22,844
SENSITIVE TO THE EXECUTIVE 

1929
01:01:22,844 --> 01:01:23,246
BRANCH. 

1930
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:25,948
AND LET ME EMPHASIZE THE MOST 

1931
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:29,384
SENSITIVE TO THE EXECUTIVE 

1932
01:01:29,384 --> 01:01:29,651
BRANCH. 

1933
01:01:29,651 --> 01:01:31,320
THE STAFF SECRETARY SERVES AS 

1934
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:35,358
AN INBOX, AN OUTBOX TO THE OVAL 

1935
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:35,758
OFFICE. 

1936
01:01:35,758 --> 01:01:38,461
AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE 

1937
01:01:38,461 --> 01:01:39,762
OPPORTUNITIES TO ASK THE 

1938
01:01:39,762 --> 01:01:42,465
NOMINEE HIMSELF WHAT HE DID 

1939
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:44,433
THEN, BUT I'M GIVING YOU MY 

1940
01:01:44,433 --> 01:01:47,136
JUDGMENT ABOUT BEING A PERSON 

1941
01:01:47,136 --> 01:01:49,605
THAT PRIMARILY WAS RESPONSIBLE 

1942
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:51,974
FOR MANAGING THE PAPER THAT 

1943
01:01:51,974 --> 01:01:52,842
CROSSES THE PRESIDENT'S DESK. 

1944
01:01:52,842 --> 01:01:56,578
HIS JOB AND IF I'M WRONG HE CAN 

1945
01:01:56,578 --> 01:01:58,414
SATISFY YOU OTHERWISE IN YOUR 

1946
01:01:58,414 --> 01:01:59,615
QUESTIOS YOU WANT TO ASK HIM. 

1947
01:01:59,615 --> 01:02:02,218
BUT HIS JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THE 

1948
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:05,888
PRESIDENT SEES THE ADVICE OF 

1949
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:08,624
OTHER ADVISORS NOT AS STAFF 

1950
01:02:08,624 --> 01:02:11,194
SECRETARY PROVIDING HIS OWN 

1951
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:12,328
ADVICE. 

1952
01:02:12,328 --> 01:02:14,429
ONE OF PRESIDENT CLINTON'S 

1953
01:02:14,429 --> 01:02:15,264
STAFF SECRETARIES TODD STERN 

1954
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:17,266
DESCRIBES THE JOB THIS WAY. 

1955
01:02:17,266 --> 01:02:18,601
I QUOTE, THE STAFF SECRETARY'S 

1956
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:20,169
JOB IS NOT TO INFLUENCE THE 

1957
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:23,573
PRESIDENT BUT INSURE HE GETS A 

1958
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,408
BALANCED DIET OF VIEWPOINTS 

1959
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:27,810
FROM ALL RELEVANT PEOPLE ON THE 

1960
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:28,043
STAFF. 

1961
01:02:28,043 --> 01:02:29,946
YOU ARE CERTAINLY NOT TRYING TO 

1962
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:32,215
PUT YOUR THUMB ON THE SCALE 

1963
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:34,951
BETWEEN OPTIONS. 

1964
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:36,219
REVIEWING JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 

1965
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:37,353
STAFF SECRETARY DOCUMENTS WOULD 

1966
01:02:37,353 --> 01:02:41,324
TEACH US NOTHING ABOUT HIS 

1967
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:42,125
LEGAL VIEWS. 

1968
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:43,659
FOR THAT WE HAVE THE HUNT 307 

1969
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:47,330
OPINIONS THAT HE WROTE AND THE 

1970
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:49,198
HUNDREDS MORE JOINED TOTALING 

1971
01:02:49,198 --> 01:02:52,001
MORE THAN 10,000 PAGES OF 

1972
01:02:52,001 --> 01:02:52,901
JUDICIAL WRITINGS. 

1973
01:02:52,901 --> 01:02:56,706
WE ALSO HAVE MORE THAN 17,000 

1974
01:02:56,706 --> 01:02:58,507
PAGES OF SPEECHES, ARTICLES, 

1975
01:02:58,507 --> 01:03:01,377
TEACHING MATERIALS, AND OTHER 

1976
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:02,812
MATERIALS THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

1977
01:03:02,812 --> 01:03:07,350
ATTACHED TO HIS 120 PAGE 

1978
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:09,952
WRITTEN RESPONSE WHICH I THINK 

1979
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:12,455
WAS A JUDICIARY'S QUESTIONNAIRE 

1980
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:13,489
WAS PROBABLY THE MOST ROBUST 

1981
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:15,658
QUESTIONNAIRE EVER SUBMITTED TO 

1982
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:18,527
A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE. 

1983
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:21,464
WE ALSO HAVE MORE THAN 480,000 

1984
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:22,899
PAGES OF E-MAILS AND OTHER 

1985
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:23,866
DOCUMENTS FROM JUDGE 

1986
01:03:23,866 --> 01:03:25,134
KAVANAUGH'S SERVICE AS AN 

1987
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:26,469
EXECUTIVE BRANCH LAWYER. 

1988
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:29,238
THIS IS A HALF MILLION PAGES OF 

1989
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:29,805
PAPER. 

1990
01:03:29,805 --> 01:03:32,108
MORE THAN THE LAST FIVE 

1991
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:33,776
CONFIRMED SUPREME COURT 

1992
01:03:33,776 --> 01:03:34,810
NOMINEES COMBINED. 

1993
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:36,411
AND IN ADDITION, TO NOT 

1994
01:03:36,411 --> 01:03:38,648
SHEDDING LIGHT ON KAVANAUGH'S 

1995
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:39,782
LEGAL VIEWS, THE STAFF 

1996
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:42,051
SECRETARY DOCUMENTS ARE VERY 

1997
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:44,620
SENSITIVE TO THE EXECUTIVE 

1998
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:45,154
BRANCH. 

1999
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:48,324
LET'S EMPHASIZE THAT WORD 

2000
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:48,624
SENSITIVE. 

2001
01:03:48,624 --> 01:03:51,460
THESE DOCUMENTS COP TAPE HIGHLY 

2002
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:54,030
-- CONTAIN HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL 

2003
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:54,597
ADVICE, INCLUDING NATIONAL 

2004
01:03:54,597 --> 01:03:55,865
SECURITY ADVICE THAT WENT FROM 

2005
01:03:55,865 --> 01:03:58,467
THE PRESIDENT TO HIS ADVISORS. 

2006
01:03:58,467 --> 01:03:59,435
IT WOULD THREATEN THE CANDOR OF 

2007
01:03:59,435 --> 01:04:03,439
FUTURE ADVICE TO PRESIDENTS IF 

2008
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:05,374
ADVISORS KNEW THEIR ADVICE 

2009
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:07,243
WOULD BE BROADLY DISCLOSED. 

2010
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:08,643
SENATORS HAVE MORE DOCUMENTS 

2011
01:04:08,643 --> 01:04:09,912
FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH THAN ANY 

2012
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:13,915
NOMINEE IN THE SENATE HISTORY. 

2013
01:04:13,915 --> 01:04:17,720
DEMOCRATIC LEADERS INSISTENT ON 

2014
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,188
GETTING STAFF DOCUMENTS. 

2015
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:24,760
I THINK WAS A WAY OF NOT HAVING 

2016
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:28,231
THIS HEARING TAKE PLACE AT THIS 

2017
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:29,699
PARTICULAR TIME. 

2018
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,268
SO CAN I PROCEED MEMBERS OF THE 

2019
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:32,701
DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS? 

2020
01:04:32,701 --> 01:04:34,804
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, IF I CAN BE 

2021
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:35,104
RECOGNIZED. 

2022
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:37,506
>> IF I'M DONE CAN I PROCEED TO 

2023
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:37,973
MY OPENING STATEMENT? 

2024
01:04:37,973 --> 01:04:39,375
>> I WILL DEFER TO MY 

2025
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:39,909
COLLEAGUES. 

2026
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:41,143
AS A POINT OF MY INFORMATION, 

2027
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:45,047
WE SENT A LETTER TO YOU SEVEN 

2028
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:45,481
DAYS AGO. 

2029
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:45,981
REGARDING THE COMMITTEE 

2030
01:04:45,981 --> 01:04:46,915
CONFIDENTIAL NATURE OF THE 

2031
01:04:46,915 --> 01:04:49,018
DOCUMENTS AND ASKED THAT THEY 

2032
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:50,852
WOULD NOT BE DESIGNATED 

2033
01:04:50,852 --> 01:04:51,553
COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL. 

2034
01:04:51,553 --> 01:04:52,121
AS ANOTHER POINT OF 

2035
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:54,156
INFORMATION, IT IS MY 

2036
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:55,224
UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE 6-

2037
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:58,460
7 MILLION PAGES OF DOCUMENTS 

2038
01:04:58,460 --> 01:04:59,327
REGARDING THE NOMINEE. 

2039
01:04:59,327 --> 01:05:01,664
AND IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING WITH 

2040
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:03,632
ALL DUE RESPECT, MR. CHAIRMAN, 

2041
01:05:03,632 --> 01:05:04,834
THAT YOU HAVE REQUESTED 10-15% 

2042
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:05,201
OF THE TOTAL. 

2043
01:05:05,201 --> 01:05:06,702
I APPRECIATE THAT THERE ARE A 

2044
01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:09,138
LOT OF PAGES OF DOCUMENTS. 

2045
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:10,306
BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS 

2046
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:12,341
CONVERSATION IN THE CONTEXT OF 

2047
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:13,775
THE TOTAL. 

2048
01:05:13,775 --> 01:05:16,212
AND THE FACT THAT WE'VE ONLY 

2049
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:18,380
BEEN GIVEN BY YOUR REQUEST 10-

2050
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:19,381
15% OF THOSE DOCUMENTS. 

2051
01:05:19,381 --> 01:05:22,251
AND MY FINAL POINT IS THIS. 

2052
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:23,753
THIS IS A HEARING ABOUT WHO 

2053
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:27,456
WILL SIT ON THE HIGHEST COURT 

2054
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:28,824
OF OUR LAND. 

2055
01:05:28,824 --> 01:05:30,593
THIS IS A HEARING THAT IS ABOUT 

2056
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:33,396
WHO WILL SIT IN A HOUSE THAT 

2057
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:36,132
SYMBOLIZES OUR SYSTEM OF 

2058
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:36,732
JUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY. 

2059
01:05:36,732 --> 01:05:39,402
AND SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT 

2060
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:41,670
PRINCIPLES BEHIND THE INTEGRITY 

2061
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:43,939
OF OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE IS 

2062
01:05:43,939 --> 01:05:46,642
THAT WE HAVE DUE PROCESS AND WE 

2063
01:05:46,642 --> 01:05:47,442
HAVE TRANSPARENCY. 

2064
01:05:47,442 --> 01:05:49,611
THAT IS WHY WE HAVE PUBLIC 

2065
01:05:49,611 --> 01:05:50,146
COURTROOMS. 

2066
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:51,447
THAT IS WHY WE HAVE 

2067
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:53,182
REQUIREMENTS IN COURTS OF LAW 

2068
01:05:53,182 --> 01:05:54,749
AND IN OUR COUNTRY. 

2069
01:05:54,749 --> 01:05:56,985
THAT THERE WILL BE 

2070
01:05:56,985 --> 01:05:57,319
TRANSPARENCY. 

2071
01:05:57,319 --> 01:05:59,555
THAT BOTH PARTIES WILL BE GIVEN 

2072
01:05:59,555 --> 01:06:00,389
ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION. 

2073
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:02,190
WE CAN ARGUE THEN AS TO THE 

2074
01:06:02,190 --> 01:06:05,061
WEIGHT OF THE DOCUMENTS AND THE 

2075
01:06:05,061 --> 01:06:06,262
SIGNIFICANCE, BUT NOT AS TO 

2076
01:06:06,262 --> 01:06:09,698
WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE 

2077
01:06:09,698 --> 01:06:10,232
ADMISSIBLE. 

2078
01:06:10,232 --> 01:06:10,933
SO I OBJECT. 

2079
01:06:10,933 --> 01:06:17,206
I ASK THAT WE RENEW AND REVISIT 

2080
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:18,641
SENATOR BLUMENTHAL'S MOTION TO 

2081
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,309
SUSPEND OR MY MOTION TO 

2082
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:21,343
POSTPONE THIS HEARING. 

2083
01:06:21,343 --> 01:06:22,878
THANK YOU. 

2084
01:06:22,878 --> 01:06:23,445
>> OKAY. 

2085
01:06:23,445 --> 01:06:23,745
THANK YOU. 

2086
01:06:23,745 --> 01:06:24,546
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 

2087
01:06:24,546 --> 01:06:25,714
>> I APPRECIATE THE COURTESY OF 

2088
01:06:25,714 --> 01:06:27,183
THE DEMOCRATS FOR ME TO 

2089
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:29,118
PROCEED. 

2090
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:33,289
>> MAY I JUST HAVE ONE LAST 

2091
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:33,656
OPPORTUNITY. 

2092
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:34,423
>> PLEASE GO AHEAD. 

2093
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:36,725
>> WITH MY MOTION. 

2094
01:06:36,725 --> 01:06:38,894
I APPRECIATE YOU GIVING ME THE 

2095
01:06:38,894 --> 01:06:39,128
FLOOR. 

2096
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:44,100
I'VE MADE A MOTION THAT IS 

2097
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:45,301
PROPERLY BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. 

2098
01:06:45,301 --> 01:06:46,802
THE CHAIRMAN SAID EARLIER THAT 

2099
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:49,471
HE HAS NEVER BEEN THROUGH A 

2100
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:51,607
CONFIRMATION PROCESS LIKE THIS 

2101
01:06:51,607 --> 01:06:52,174
ONE. 

2102
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:54,176
THE REASON IS, THAT NO ONE 

2103
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:57,146
ADMINISTRATION IN THE PAST HAS 

2104
01:06:57,146 --> 01:06:59,548
ENGAGED IN THIS KIND OF 

2105
01:06:59,548 --> 01:06:59,881
CONCEALMENT. 

2106
01:06:59,881 --> 01:07:02,284
THAT IS THE REASON. 

2107
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:02,718
VERY SIMPLY. 

2108
01:07:02,718 --> 01:07:05,954
IT IS NOT THE CHAIRMAN'S DOING. 

2109
01:07:05,954 --> 01:07:06,288
NECESSARILY. 

2110
01:07:06,288 --> 01:07:08,591
IT IS THIS ADMINISTRATION THAT 

2111
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:09,859
HAS CONCEALED AND HIDDEN 

2112
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:12,561
DOCUMENTS FROM US AND FROM THE 

2113
01:07:12,561 --> 01:07:13,028
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

2114
01:07:13,028 --> 01:07:16,398
AND SO I RENEW MY MOTION THAT 

2115
01:07:16,398 --> 01:07:18,968
WE ADJOURN SO THAT WE CAN 

2116
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:20,202
ACCESS THE DOCUMENTS WE NEED, 

2117
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:23,505
REVIEW THEM IN A DELIBERATE AND 

2118
01:07:23,505 --> 01:07:23,906
THOUGHTFUL WAY. 

2119
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:25,574
MUCH HAS BEEN DONE FOR 

2120
01:07:25,574 --> 01:07:28,844
COLLEAGUES IN THE PAST WHEN 

2121
01:07:28,844 --> 01:07:30,846
THEY HAVE REQUESTED IT AND IS 

2122
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:33,149
REQUIRED UNDER RULE FOUR OF OUR 

2123
01:07:33,149 --> 01:07:33,382
RULES. 

2124
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:36,118
THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT THAT WE 

2125
01:07:36,118 --> 01:07:38,153
BE IN EXECUTIVE SESSION TO 

2126
01:07:38,153 --> 01:07:42,290
FOLLOW THIS RULE, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

2127
01:07:42,290 --> 01:07:44,960
AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT WE 

2128
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,529
FOLLOW OUR RULES, THAT WE 

2129
01:07:47,529 --> 01:07:48,964
PROCEED IN ACCORDANCE WITH 

2130
01:07:48,964 --> 01:07:54,603
THOSE NORMS AND I KNOW THAT THE 

2131
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:56,739
CHAIRMAN HAS GREAT RESPECT FOR 

2132
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,740
OPEN GOVERNMENT, FOR WHISTLE 

2133
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:01,577
BLOWERS, FOR SUNLIGHT AS THE 

2134
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:02,010
BEST DISINFECTANT. 

2135
01:08:02,010 --> 01:08:04,713
WE NEED SOME SUNLIGHT IN THIS 

2136
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:05,013
PROCESS. 

2137
01:08:05,013 --> 01:08:06,348
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

2138
01:08:06,348 --> 01:08:08,117
I AGAIN RENEW MY MOTION TO 

2139
01:08:08,117 --> 01:08:10,418
ADJOURN WHICH HAS BEEN SECONDED 

2140
01:08:10,418 --> 01:08:10,919
BY SENATOR WHITEHOUSE. 

2141
01:08:10,919 --> 01:08:14,423
>> DENIED BECAUSE WE ARE NOT IN 

2142
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:14,856
EXECUTIVE SESSION. 

2143
01:08:14,856 --> 01:08:15,223
I WILL PROCEED. 

2144
01:08:15,223 --> 01:08:16,425
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, BEFORE YOU 

2145
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:16,692
PROCEED. 

2146
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:19,694
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ONE 

2147
01:08:19,694 --> 01:08:19,995
CORRECTION. 

2148
01:08:19,995 --> 01:08:24,233
THERE IS A MISCONCEPTION AS TO 

2149
01:08:24,233 --> 01:08:29,138
WHITE HOUSE STAFF SECRETARIES 

2150
01:08:29,138 --> 01:08:31,439
DO. 

2151
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:33,442
TWO PAST SECRETARIES WROTE AN 

2152
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:35,444
OPED TITLED STAFF SECRETARIES 

2153
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:36,245
ARE NOT TRAFFIC STOPS. 

2154
01:08:36,245 --> 01:08:38,380
STOP TREATING KAVANAUGH LIKE HE 

2155
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:38,947
WAS ONE. 

2156
01:08:38,947 --> 01:08:39,546
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HIMSELF HAS 

2157
01:08:39,546 --> 01:08:41,082
ACKNOWLEDGED THE IMPORTANCE OF 

2158
01:08:41,082 --> 01:08:43,819
A TIME THAT HE WAS WHITE HOUSE 

2159
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:44,520
STAFF SECRETARY SO WHY, MR. 

2160
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,823
CHAIRMAN, YOU AND THE OTHERS ON 

2161
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:49,158
YOUR SIDE KEEP SAYING THAT THIS 

2162
01:08:49,158 --> 01:08:50,826
IS A NOTHING KIND OF A JOB. 

2163
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:52,261
NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM 

2164
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:52,794
THE TRUTH. 

2165
01:08:52,794 --> 01:08:56,497
AND THIS IS WHY WE ARE SO 

2166
01:08:56,497 --> 01:08:58,500
ADAMANT ABOUT REQUESTING THESE 

2167
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:01,770
DOCUMENTS THAT THE JUDGE 

2168
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:04,006
HIMSELF, THE NOMINEE HIMSELF 

2169
01:09:04,006 --> 01:09:06,975
HAS SAID WE'RE AMONG THE MOST 

2170

INFORMATIVE TIME OF HIS ADULT 

2171
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:08,978
LIFE.

JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

2176
01:09:13,215 --> 01:09:14,883

QUESTION ABOUT HIS ROLE IN

01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:36,305
COLLEAGUES. 

2189
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:40,709
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE I HAVE 

2190
01:09:40,709 --> 01:09:41,210
RESPECT FOR. 

2191
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:44,712
WE ARE EXPECTED TO EVALUATE A 

2192
01:09:44,712 --> 01:09:45,180
NOMINEE. 

2193
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:45,981
WHO HAS A VAST RECORD. 

2194
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:48,384
AND IF YOU LOOK AND A LOT OF 

2195
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:51,386
NUMBERS HAVE BEEN CITED. 

2196
01:09:51,386 --> 01:09:51,720
10,000 HERE. 

2197
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:52,053
40,000 HERE. 

2198
01:09:52,053 --> 01:09:53,020
100,000 HERE. 

2199
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:55,623
BUT AN ENTIRE BODY OF HIS 

2200
01:09:55,623 --> 01:09:56,792
RECORD, WE ONLY HAVE 10% OF HIS 

2201
01:09:56,792 --> 01:10:00,663
RECORD WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO 

2202
01:10:00,663 --> 01:10:00,930
EVALUATE. 

2203
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:02,498
90% HAS BEEN WITHHELD FROM 

2204
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:02,765
SENATORS. 

2205
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:04,633
WE ARE ASKING TO EVALUATE A 

2206
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:05,901
CANDIDATE, TO HAVE INTELLIGENCE 

2207
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:07,803
QUESTIONS AND INSIGHTS INTO HIS 

2208
01:10:07,803 --> 01:10:09,772
RECORD, BUT WE ONLY HAVE 10% OF 

2209
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:10,172
THAT RECORD. 

2210
01:10:10,172 --> 01:10:11,840
WE CAN GO ON AND ON ABOUT THE 

2211
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,976
NUMBERS OF DOCUMENTS, HUNDREDS 

2212
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:15,010
OF THOUSANDS, TEN THOUSANDS. 

2213
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:18,247
BUT WE ARE ABOUT TO PROCEED 

2214
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:18,980
WITH A HISTORIC HEARING. 

2215
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:20,082
WE'RE ABOUT TO PROCEED TOWARD 

2216
01:10:20,082 --> 01:10:21,650
HAVING A HEARING ON SOMEONE 

2217
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:24,052
HAVING A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT 

2218
01:10:24,052 --> 01:10:26,554
ON THE MOST IMPORTANT COURT IN 

2219
01:10:26,554 --> 01:10:29,491
THE LAND. 

2220
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:32,761
THAT WILL EFFECT SO MANY AREAS 

2221
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:33,161
OF AMERICAN LIFE. 

2222
01:10:33,161 --> 01:10:34,596
FROM CIVIL RIGHTS TO WOMEN 

2223
01:10:34,596 --> 01:10:36,498
RIGHTS TO ACCESS TO HEALTH 

2224
01:10:36,498 --> 01:10:36,698
CARE. 

2225
01:10:36,698 --> 01:10:39,868
AND WE ARE GOING INTO THIS ONLY 

2226
01:10:39,868 --> 01:10:42,271
HAVING 10%, ACCESS TO 10% OF 

2227
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:46,675
THE BODY OF WORK OF THIS MAN'S 

2228
01:10:46,675 --> 01:10:46,908
CAREER. 

2229
01:10:46,908 --> 01:10:48,677
THAT SEEMS TO ME COMMON SENSE. 

2230
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:50,312
90% IS MISSING RIGHT NOW. 

2231
01:10:50,312 --> 01:10:53,816
JUST COMMON SENSE SAYS WE 

2232
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:55,484
SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO 

2233
01:10:55,484 --> 01:10:56,351
THOROUGHLY EVALUATE THIS 

2234
01:10:56,351 --> 01:10:56,819
PERSON. 

2235
01:10:56,819 --> 01:11:00,355
WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR ANYTHING 

2236
01:11:00,355 --> 01:11:02,258
OUT OF THE ORDINARY. 

2237
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,093
OTHER CANDIDATES HAVE COME 

2238
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:04,326
BEFORE. 

2239
01:11:04,326 --> 01:11:05,527
BUT WE HAVE GOTTEN FAR MORE FOR 

2240
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:08,030
EVERY SUPREME COURT JUSTICE 

2241
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:11,367
THAT HAS BEEN MENTIONED HERE. 

2242
01:11:11,367 --> 01:11:12,166
FAR MORE THAN JUST 10%. 

2243
01:11:12,166 --> 01:11:13,735
MY COLLEAGUE TALK ABOUT WHAT 

2244
01:11:13,735 --> 01:11:15,537
OUR DUTY TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC 

2245
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:15,871
IS. 

2246
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:16,838
IT IS TO EVALUATE A CANDIDATE 

2247
01:11:16,838 --> 01:11:18,907
ON THEIR BODY OF WORK. 

2248
01:11:18,907 --> 01:11:21,109
WE'RE NOT EVEN GETTING RELEASE 

2249
01:11:21,109 --> 01:11:21,944
OF THAT. 

2250
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:22,144
WHY? 

2251
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:22,778
BECAUSE SOME POLITICAL PERSON. 

2252
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:26,382
NOT THE PERSON WHO HOLDS PUBLIC 

2253
01:11:26,382 --> 01:11:26,949
OFFICE. 

2254
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:31,920
NOT BECAUSE -- IT'S UNPRECEDENT 

2255
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:32,921
TO THINK THIS COMMITTEE HAS 

2256
01:11:32,921 --> 01:11:33,889
SEEDED ITS ROLE. 

2257
01:11:33,889 --> 01:11:37,092
HERE WE ARE ABOUT TO GO FORWARD 

2258
01:11:37,092 --> 01:11:37,759
WITH 10% OF THIS PERSON'S 

2259
01:11:37,759 --> 01:11:38,627
RECORD TO EVALUATE. 

2260
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:41,630
TO BASE OUR QUESTIONS ON TO 

2261
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:41,963
INVESTIGATE. 

2262
01:11:41,963 --> 01:11:42,464
90% IS BEING WITHHELD. 

2263
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:43,298
JUST COMMON SENSE WOULD SAY 

2264
01:11:43,298 --> 01:11:45,868
THAT IS NOT FAIR, THAT IS NOT 

2265
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:46,101
RIGHT. 

2266
01:11:46,101 --> 01:11:48,137
IT UNDER MINES OUR ABILITY TO 

2267
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:50,305
DO OUR JOB. 

2268
01:11:50,305 --> 01:12:00,616
IT IS JUST PLAIN WRONG. 

2269
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:04,586
[PROTEST] 

2270
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:07,055

2274
01:12:13,796 --> 01:12:15,197
NOMINATION OF SUPREME COURT 

2275
01:12:15,197 --> 01:12:17,166
JUSTICES. 

2276
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:20,836
WE ARE HERE THIS WEEK TO HEAR 

2277
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:22,037

2278
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:23,272

2279
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:24,373
QUALIFICATIONS, HIS RECORD TO

01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:30,913
DEDICATION TO THE RULE OF LAW, 

2281
01:12:30,913 --> 01:12:31,846
AND HIS DEMONSTRATED 

2282
01:12:31,846 --> 01:12:32,313
INDEPENDENCE AND HIS 

2283
01:12:32,313 --> 01:12:33,949
APPRECIATION OF THE IMPORTANCE 

2284
01:12:33,949 --> 01:12:37,586
OF THE SEPARATION OF POWERS. 

2285
01:12:37,586 --> 01:12:39,755
INDEED TO PROTECT INDIVIDUAL 

2286
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:44,026
LIBERTY, THE FRAMERS DESIGNED A 

2287
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:47,196
GOVERNMENT OF THREE COEQUAL 

2288
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:47,796
BRANCHES STRICTLY SEPARATING 

2289
01:12:47,796 --> 01:12:49,364
LEGISLATIVE EXECUTIVE AND 

2290
01:12:49,364 --> 01:12:49,765
JUDICIAL POWERS. 

2291
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:52,500
THE FRAMERS INTENDED FOR THE 

2292
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:55,938
JUDICIARY TO BE IMMUNE FROM THE 

2293
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:58,106
POLITICAL PRESSURES THE OTHER 

2294
01:12:58,106 --> 01:12:59,041
TWO FACE. 

2295
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:02,377
THAT IS SO THAT JUDGES WOULD 

2296
01:13:02,377 --> 01:13:06,615
DECIDE CASES ACCORDING TO THE 

2297
01:13:06,615 --> 01:13:14,289
LAW AND NOT ACCORDING TO 

2298
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:14,689
POPULAR OPINION. 

2299
01:13:14,689 --> 01:13:18,827
NOW 230 YEARS AFTER RATIFY CASE 

2300
01:13:18,827 --> 01:13:24,566
OUR LEGAL SYSTEM IS -- IT 

2301
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:25,266
PROVIDES OUR PEOPLE STABILITY, 

2302
01:13:25,266 --> 01:13:26,568
PREDICTABILITY, PROTECTION OF 

2303
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:30,506
OUR RIGHTS AND EQUAL ACCESS TO 

2304
01:13:30,506 --> 01:13:36,912
JUSTICE BUT THIS IS ONLY 

2305
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:37,445
POSSIBLE WHEN JUDGES ARE 

2306
01:13:37,445 --> 01:13:40,648
COMMITTEE -- COMMITTED TO THE 

2307
01:13:40,648 --> 01:13:41,149
RULE OF LAW. 

2308
01:13:41,149 --> 01:13:44,019
OUR LEGAL SYSTEM IS BUILT ON 

2309
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:45,854
JUDGES THAT THEIR ROLE IS 

2310
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:47,656
LIMITED TO DECIDING CASES AND 

2311
01:13:47,656 --> 01:13:51,159
CONTROVERSY. 

2312
01:13:51,159 --> 01:13:54,563
A GOOD JUDGE EXERCISES 

2313
01:13:54,563 --> 01:13:56,731
HUMILITY, AND MAKES DECISIONS 

2314
01:13:56,731 --> 01:13:57,999
ACCORDING TO SPECIFIC FACTS OF 

2315
01:13:57,999 --> 01:13:59,835
THE CASE AND OF COURSE 

2316
01:13:59,835 --> 01:14:04,806
ACCORDING TO THE LAW. 

2317
01:14:04,806 --> 01:14:12,047
A GOOD JUDGE NEVER BASES 

2318
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:15,150
DECISIONS ON HIS PREFERRED 

2319
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:16,117
POLICY PREFERENCES. 

2320
01:14:16,117 --> 01:14:18,554
A GOOD JUDGE ALSO HAS COURAGE, 

2321
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:23,859
RECOGNIZING THAT WE HAVE AN 

2322
01:14:23,859 --> 01:14:26,595
INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY TO 

2323
01:14:26,595 --> 01:14:28,864
RESTRAIN JUDGES WHEN THAT 

2324
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:31,867
GOVERNMENT EXCEEDS LAWFUL 

2325
01:14:31,867 --> 01:14:32,167
AUTHITY. 

2326
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:33,268
PRESIDENT ANDREW JACKSON SAID 

2327
01:14:33,268 --> 01:14:35,938
QUOTE, ALL THE RIGHTS SECURED 

2328
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:38,340
TO THE CITIZENS UNDER THE 

2329
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,642
CONSTITUTION ARE WORTH NOTHING 

2330
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:43,946
AND A MERE BUBBLE EXPECT 

2331
01:14:43,946 --> 01:14:47,316
GUARANTEED TO THEM BY AN 

2332
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:49,718
INDEPENDENT AND VIRTUOUS 

2333
01:14:49,718 --> 01:14:50,452
JUDICIARY. 

2334
01:14:50,452 --> 01:14:51,319
END OF QUOTE. 

2335
01:14:51,319 --> 01:14:53,888
CONFIRMATION HEARINGS FOR 

2336
01:14:53,888 --> 01:14:56,158
SUPREME COURT NOMINEES ARE AN 

2337
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:58,427
INDEPENDENT ARE VERY IMPORTANT 

2338
01:14:58,427 --> 01:15:02,397
OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE 

2339
01:15:02,397 --> 01:15:03,231
APPROPRIATE ROLE OF JUDGES. 

2340
01:15:03,231 --> 01:15:06,368
AS I SEE IT AND I EXPECT MANY 

2341
01:15:06,368 --> 01:15:08,069
OF MY COLLEAGUES WILL AGREE, 

2342
01:15:08,069 --> 01:15:10,705
THE ROLE OF THE JUDGE IS TO 

2343
01:15:10,705 --> 01:15:14,476
APPLY THE LAW AS WRITTEN EVEN 

2344
01:15:14,476 --> 01:15:17,746
IF THE LEGAL RESULT IS NOT ONE 

2345
01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:21,083
THAT THE JUDGE PERSONALLY 

2346
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:21,316
LIKES. 

2347
01:15:21,316 --> 01:15:22,718
JUSTICE SCALIA IS OFTEN BEING 

2348
01:15:22,718 --> 01:15:24,052
QUOTED BECAUSE HE WAS FOND OF 

2349
01:15:24,052 --> 01:15:25,687
SAYING IF A JUDGE ALWAYS LIKES 

2350
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:28,290
THE OUTCOME OF THE CASES HE 

2351
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:29,992
DECIDES, HE IS PROBABLY DOING 

2352
01:15:29,992 --> 01:15:32,293
SOMETHING WRONG. 

2353
01:15:32,293 --> 01:15:35,263
I DON'T WANT JUDGES WHO ALWAYS 

2354
01:15:35,263 --> 01:15:37,799
REACH A LIBERAL RESULT OR 

2355
01:15:37,799 --> 01:15:38,967
CONSERVATIVE RESULT. 

2356
01:15:38,967 --> 01:15:41,536
I WANT A JUDGE WHO RULES THE 

2357
01:15:41,536 --> 01:15:46,207
LAW THE WAY THE LAW REQUIRES. 

2358
01:15:46,207 --> 01:15:48,676
JUDGES MUST LEAVE LAW MAKING TO 

2359
01:15:48,676 --> 01:15:50,444
THE CONGRESS. 

2360
01:15:50,444 --> 01:15:53,548
THE ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES OF 

2361
01:15:53,548 --> 01:15:54,015
THE PEOPLE. 

2362
01:15:54,015 --> 01:15:55,684
JUDGES AND JUSTICES HAVE 

2363
01:15:55,684 --> 01:15:56,184
LIFETIME APPOINTMENTS. 

2364
01:15:56,184 --> 01:16:00,789
THEY CAN'T BE VOTED OUT OF 

2365
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:01,523
OFFICE IF THEY LEGISLATE. 

2366
01:16:01,523 --> 01:16:02,557
WHEREAS IF CONGRESS LEGISLATES 

2367
01:16:02,557 --> 01:16:03,658
SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE DON'T 

2368
01:16:03,658 --> 01:16:06,261
LIKE, THEN YOU CAN VOTE THEM 

2369
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:08,897
OUT OF OFFICE. 

2370
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:09,464
THAT IS WHY THEY ARE TO 

2371
01:16:09,464 --> 01:16:11,166
INTERPRET LAW AND NOT MAKE LAW. 

2372
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:12,534
SOME HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT VIEW 

2373
01:16:12,534 --> 01:16:15,604
OF WHAT A JUDGES ROLE SHOULD 

2374
01:16:15,604 --> 01:16:16,171
BE. 

2375
01:16:16,171 --> 01:16:17,772
ACCORDING TO THIS FEUD, JUDGES 

2376
01:16:17,772 --> 01:16:19,741
SHOULD DECIDE CASES BASED UPON 

2377
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:22,144
PARTICULAR OUTCOMES IN ORDER TO 

2378
01:16:22,144 --> 01:16:22,777
ADVANCE THEIR POLITICS. 

2379
01:16:22,777 --> 01:16:24,613
BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T 

2380
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:26,281
WANT THEIR JUDGES TO PICK SIDES 

2381
01:16:26,281 --> 01:16:28,216
BEFORE THEY HEAR A CASE. 

2382
01:16:28,216 --> 01:16:32,220
THEY WANT A JUDGE THAT RULES 

2383
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:34,122
BASED UPON WHAT THE LAW 

2384
01:16:34,122 --> 01:16:34,389
COMMANDS. 

2385
01:16:34,389 --> 01:16:39,927
THIS IS THE REASON WHY ALL 

2386
01:16:39,927 --> 01:16:40,829
SUPREME COURT NOMINEES SINCE 

2387
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:43,098
AGAINST BURG HAVE DECLINED TO 

2388
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:45,233
OFFER THEIR PERSONAL OPINIONS 

2389
01:16:45,233 --> 01:16:48,637
ON THE CORRECTNESS OF 

2390
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:48,937
PRECEDENT. 

2391
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:50,872
SEEKING ASSURANCES FROM A 

2392
01:16:50,872 --> 01:16:52,874
NOMINEE ON HOW HE WILL VOTE IN 

2393
01:16:52,874 --> 01:16:59,014
CERTAIN CASES OR HOW HE VIEWS 

2394
01:16:59,014 --> 01:17:00,749
CERTAIN PRECEDENT UNDER MINES 

2395
01:17:00,749 --> 01:17:01,450
JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND 

2396
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:04,119
ESSENTIALLY ASKS FOR A PROMISE 

2397
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:10,258
IN EXCHANGE FOR A CONFIRMATION 

2398
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:12,327
VOTE. 

2399
01:17:12,327 --> 01:17:19,834
IT'S UNFAIR AND UNETHICAL 

2400
01:17:19,834 --> 01:17:22,738
INDEED WHAT -- I EXPECT JUDGE 

2401
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:24,740
KAVANAUGH, IN FACT, IT'S MY 

2402
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:31,345
ADVICE TO HIM, TO FOLLOW THE 

2403
01:17:31,345 --> 01:17:34,316
EXAMPLE SET BY JUSTICE AGAINST 

2404
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:40,188
BURG AND ALL NOMINEES THAT 

2405
01:17:40,188 --> 01:17:44,126
FOLLOWED HER. 

2406
01:17:44,126 --> 01:17:45,260
JUSTICE KAGAN WHEN ASKED ABOUT 

2407
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:47,429
ROE V WADE SAID THE FOLLOWING, 

2408
01:17:47,429 --> 01:17:49,931
QUOTE, I DO NOT BELIEVE IT 

2409
01:17:49,931 --> 01:17:51,900
WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO COMMENT 

2410
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:54,769
ON THE MERITS OF ROE V WADE 

2411
01:17:54,769 --> 01:17:57,139
OTHER THAN TO SAY IT'S A 

2412
01:17:57,139 --> 01:17:58,573
SETTLED LAW ENTITLED TO 

2413
01:17:58,573 --> 01:17:59,040
PRESIDENTIAL WEIGHT. 

2414
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,576
THE APPLICATION OF ROE TO 

2415
01:18:01,576 --> 01:18:04,146
FUTURE CASES AND EVEN ITS 

2416
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:05,547
CONTINUED VALIDITY ARE ISSUES 

2417
01:18:05,547 --> 01:18:09,117
LIKELY TO COME BEFORE THE COURT 

2418
01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:10,952
IN THE FUTURE. 

2419
01:18:10,952 --> 01:18:11,519
END OF QUOTE. 

2420
01:18:11,519 --> 01:18:16,525
SENATORS WERE SATISFIED WITH 

2421
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:17,625
THESE ANSWERS UNPRECEDENT. 

2422
01:18:17,625 --> 01:18:21,062
SO SENATORS SHOULD BE SATISFIED 

2423
01:18:21,062 --> 01:18:23,064
IF JUDGE KAVANAUGH ANSWERS 

2424
01:18:23,064 --> 01:18:23,364
SIMILARLY. 

2425
01:18:23,364 --> 01:18:25,767
THIS IS MY 15th SUPREME COURT 

2426
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:28,203
CONFIRMATION HEARING INSURANCE 

2427
01:18:28,203 --> 01:18:31,539
I JOINED THE COMMITTEE IN 1981. 

2428
01:18:31,539 --> 01:18:34,976
31 YEARS AGO DURING MY FOURTH 

2429
01:18:34,976 --> 01:18:36,945
SUPREME COURT CONFIRMATION 

2430
01:18:36,945 --> 01:18:39,414
HEARING, LIBERAL OUTSIDE GROUPS 

2431
01:18:39,414 --> 01:18:42,517
AND THEIR SENATE ALLIES ENGAGED 

2432
01:18:42,517 --> 01:18:50,592
IN UNPRECEDENTED SMEAR CAMPAIGN 

2433
01:18:50,592 --> 01:18:53,528
AGAINST JUDGE ROBERT. 

2434
01:18:53,528 --> 01:18:55,497
THE BORING OF ROBERT BORK 

2435
01:18:55,497 --> 01:18:57,632
TAUGHT SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS 

2436
01:18:57,632 --> 01:18:59,768
THAW CAN DEMONIZE SPECIAL 

2437
01:18:59,768 --> 01:19:02,804
INTEREST GROUPS BASED ON THEIR 

2438
01:19:02,804 --> 01:19:03,104
WORLD VIEW. 

2439
01:19:03,104 --> 01:19:04,439
WORSE CHARACTER ASSASSINATIONS 

2440
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:06,708
PROVED AN EFFECTIVE TACTIC 

2441
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:10,245
NEARLY SINKING JUSTICE CLARENCE 

2442
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:11,847
THOMAS' APPOINTMENT FOUR YEARS 

2443
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:12,080
LATER. 

2444
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:16,051
BUT HE ALSO SAID, CONTINUING TO 

2445
01:19:16,051 --> 01:19:18,787
QUOTE, BY CONFIRMING JUDGE 

2446
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:23,825
KAVANAUGH, THE SENATE CAN GO 

2447
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:28,462
SOME WAY TOWARD ATONING FOR 

2448
01:19:28,462 --> 01:19:29,798
SHAMEFUL TREATMENT OF JUSTICE 

2449
01:19:29,798 --> 01:19:33,501
ROBERT BORK 31 YEARS AGO. 

2450
01:19:33,501 --> 01:19:37,706
JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS ONE OF THE 

2451
01:19:37,706 --> 01:19:38,240
MOST QUALIFIED NOMINEE.

THE MOST INFLUENTIAL FEDERAL 

2461
01:19:55,556 --> 01:19:55,923
CIRCUIT COURT. 

2462
01:19:55,923 --> 01:19:57,192
HE HAS ONE OF THE MOST 

2463
01:19:57,192 --> 01:20:00,228
IMPRESSIVE RECORDS FOR A LOWER 

2464
01:20:00,228 --> 01:20:01,629

KAVANAUGH UNANIMOUSLY WELL 

2476
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:31,759
QUALIFIED. 

2477
01:20:31,759 --> 01:20:34,629
HE HAS WRITTEN ELOQUENTLY THAT 

2478
01:20:34,629 --> 01:20:35,964
BOTH JUDGES AND FEDERAL

THE LAW, CONGRESS. 

2481
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:43,538
HE HAS CRITICIZED THOSE THAT 

2482
01:20:43,538 --> 01:20:45,507
SUBSTITUTE THEIR OWN JUDGMENT 

2483
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:48,043
ABOUT WHAT A STATUE SHOULD SAY 

2484
01:20:48,043 --> 01:20:52,948
AND WHAT THE STATUE ACTUALLY 

2485
01:20:52,948 --> 01:20:53,214
SAYS. 

2486
01:20:53,214 --> 01:20:55,216
AFTER PRESIDENT NOMINATED JUDGE 

2487
01:20:55,216 --> 01:20:58,887
KAVANAUGH, I SAID THIS WOULD BE 

2488
01:20:58,887 --> 01:21:01,122

SHE HAD MORE TO SAY ON HER 

2549
01:23:09,551 --> 01:23:09,984
OPENING STATEMENT. 

2550
01:23:09,984 --> 01:23:20,094
IF SHE DOESN'T, I WILL GO TO 

2551
01:23:20,094 --> 01:23:20,361
SENATOR. 

2552
01:23:20,361 --> 01:23:22,029
>> I WILL PROBABLY TRAM DATE IT 

2553
01:23:22,029 --> 01:23:22,664
EVEN SO. 

2554
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:25,333
BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY 

2555
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:28,836
IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE AS WELL 

2556
01:23:28,836 --> 01:23:30,405
AS THE JUDGE, THE NOMINEE 

2557
01:23:30,405 --> 01:23:31,339
UNDERSTAND HOW STRONGLY WE FEEL 

2558
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:35,810
AND WHY WE FEEL THAT WAY. 

2559
01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:38,279
I AMOUNT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT 

2560
01:23:38,279 --> 01:23:41,349
ABOUT ONE OF THE BIG DECISIONS 

2561
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:46,454
THAT WE HAVE THE BELIEF THAT 

2562
01:23:46,454 --> 01:23:47,288
ALTHOUGH YOU TOLD SENATOR 

2563
01:23:47,288 --> 01:23:50,458
COLLINS THAT YOU BELIEVE IT WAS 

2564
01:23:50,458 --> 01:23:51,325
SETTLED LAW, THE QUESTION IS 

2565
01:23:51,325 --> 01:23:54,095
REALLY DO YOU BELIEVE IT'S 

2566
01:23:54,095 --> 01:23:54,429
CORRECT LAW. 

2567
01:23:54,429 --> 01:23:57,198
AND THAT IS ROE V WADE. 

2568
01:23:57,198 --> 01:24:01,702
I WAS IN THE 50s AND 60s ACTIVE 

2569
01:24:01,702 --> 01:24:08,643
BUT FIRST A STUDENT AT 

2570
01:24:08,643 --> 01:24:08,910
STANFORD. 

2571
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:09,944
I SAW WHAT HAPPENED. 

2572
01:24:09,944 --> 01:24:12,480
I SAW WHAT HAPPENS TO WOMEN 

2573
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:13,948
WHEN THEY BECAME PREGNANT. 

2574
01:24:13,948 --> 01:24:15,616
I SAT AS AN APPOINTEE OF 

2575
01:24:15,616 --> 01:24:17,885
GOVERNOR BROWNS ON THE TERMS 

2576
01:24:17,885 --> 01:24:19,020
CITING AND PAROLING AUTHORITY 

2577
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:41,709
FOR WOMEN IN 

2578
01:24:44,312 --> 01:24:46,614
. 

2579
01:24:46,614 --> 01:24:48,716
>>> THOSE STATISTICS THAT HAVE 

2580
01:24:48,716 --> 01:24:50,451
BEEN PUT OUT ARE REALLY 

2581
01:24:50,451 --> 01:24:50,752
HORRENDOUS. 

2582
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:52,120
FOR YOU, THEPRESIDENT THAT 

2583
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:55,456
NOMINATED YOU,   HAS SAID I 

2584
01:24:55,456 --> 01:24:58,259
WILL NOMINATE SOMEONE  WHO IS 

2585
01:24:58,259 --> 01:25:01,696
ANTI-CHOICE AND PRO GUN.      

2586
01:25:01,696 --> 01:25:04,933
AND WE BELIEVE  WHAT HE SAID.   

2587
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:08,937
WE CANNOT FIND THE DOCUMENTS  

2588
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:09,637
THAT ABSOLVE FROM THAT 

2589
01:25:09,637 --> 01:25:13,174
CONCLUSION.    

2590
01:25:13,174 --> 01:25:16,311
SO,  WHAT WOMEN HAVE WON 

2591
01:25:16,311 --> 01:25:20,448
THROUGH ROE AND A HOST OF 

2592
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:24,319
PRIVACY CASES  YET TO BE ABLE 

2593
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:26,688
TO CONTROL THEIR OWN 

2594
01:25:26,688 --> 01:25:27,255
REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM TO HAVE 

2595
01:25:27,255 --> 01:25:28,189
BASIC PRIVACY RIGHTS REALLY 

2596
01:25:28,189 --> 01:25:29,057
EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT TO 

2597
01:25:29,057 --> 01:25:32,327
THIS SIDE OF THE ISLE. 

2598
01:25:32,327 --> 01:25:36,397
AND IHOPE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE 

2599
01:25:36,397 --> 01:25:38,666
ISLE AS WELL.     

2600
01:25:38,666 --> 01:25:41,635
LAST YEAR  YOU DRAFTED A 

2601
01:25:41,635 --> 01:25:47,609
DISSENT IN GARZAV -- AND THAT'S 

2602
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:48,209
A CASE WHERE A YOUNG WOMAN IN 

2603
01:25:48,209 --> 01:25:51,279
TEXAS, I BELIEVE, WAS SEEKING 

2604
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:51,913
AN ABORTION. 

2605
01:25:51,913 --> 01:25:53,914
IN THAT YOU ARGUEDTHAT EVEN 

2606
01:25:53,914 --> 01:25:57,117
THOUGH THE YOUNG WOMAN HAD 

2607
01:25:57,117 --> 01:25:59,487
COMPLIED WITH THE TEXAS 

2608
01:25:59,487 --> 01:26:01,822
PARENTAL NOTIFICATION LAW SHE 

2609
01:26:01,822 --> 01:26:03,658
SHOULD NONETHELESS BE BARRED.   

2610
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:07,128
IN MAKING YOUR ARGUMENT,  YOU 

2611
01:26:07,128 --> 01:26:09,397
IGNORED, AND I BELIEVE, 

2612
01:26:09,397 --> 01:26:11,732
MISCHARACTERIZED A SUPREME 

2613
01:26:11,732 --> 01:26:12,132
COURT PRECEDENT. 

2614
01:26:12,132 --> 01:26:14,836
YOUREASONED THAT JANE DOE 

2615
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:15,336
SHOULD NOT BE UNABLE TO 

2616
01:26:15,336 --> 01:26:17,338
EXERCISE HER RIGHT TO CHOOSE, 

2617
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:19,440
BECAUSE SHE DID NOT HAVE FAMILY 

2618
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:21,275
AND FRIENDS  TO MAKE HER 

2619
01:26:21,275 --> 01:26:23,878
DECISION.     

2620
01:26:23,878 --> 01:26:25,480
THE ARGUMENT REWRITES SUPREME 

2621
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:28,516
COURT PRECEDENT.    

2622
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:30,284
AND IF ADOPTED WE BELIEVE, 

2623
01:26:30,284 --> 01:26:30,818
WOULD REQUIRE COURTS TO 

2624
01:26:30,818 --> 01:26:34,155
DETERMINE  WHETHER A YOUNG 

2625
01:26:34,155 --> 01:26:34,822
WOMAN HAD A SUFFICIENT SUPPORT 

2626
01:26:34,822 --> 01:26:35,657
NETWORK  WHEN MAKING HER 

2627
01:26:35,657 --> 01:26:37,292
DECISION.     

2628
01:26:37,292 --> 01:26:39,327
EVEN IN CASES  WHERE SHE HAS 

2629
01:26:39,327 --> 01:26:41,696
GONE TO COURT.    

2630
01:26:41,696 --> 01:26:44,231
THIS REASON  WE BELIEVE, I 

2631
01:26:44,231 --> 01:26:49,370
BELIEVE, DEMONSTRATES  THAT YOU 

2632
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:50,705
ARE WILLING TO DISREGARD 

2633
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:51,472
PRECEDENT.    

2634
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:55,543
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE  BECAUSE 

2635
01:26:55,543 --> 01:26:58,313
JUST SAYING SOMETHING SETTLED 

2636
01:26:58,313 --> 01:26:58,912
LAW, IT REALLY IS, IS IT 

2637
01:26:58,912 --> 01:27:01,115
CORRECT LAW?    

2638
01:27:01,115 --> 01:27:05,353
UM,  THE IMPACT OF OVERTURNING 

2639
01:27:05,353 --> 01:27:07,121
ROE IS MUCH BROADER THAN A 

2640
01:27:07,121 --> 01:27:10,725
WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. 

2641
01:27:10,725 --> 01:27:11,993
IT'S ABOUTPROTECTING THE MOST 

2642
01:27:11,993 --> 01:27:12,626
PERSONAL DECISIONS WE ALL MAKE 

2643
01:27:12,626 --> 01:27:17,732
FROM GOVERNMENT INTRUSION.     

2644
01:27:17,732 --> 01:27:19,500
ROE IS ONE IN A SERIES OF CASES 

2645
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,268
THAT UPHELD AN INDIVIDUAL'S 

2646
01:27:21,268 --> 01:27:24,205
RIGHT TO DECIDE WHO TO MARRY, 

2647
01:27:24,205 --> 01:27:27,175
IT'S NOT THE GOVERNMENT'S 

2648
01:27:27,175 --> 01:27:27,708
RIGHT, WHERE TO SEND YOUR 

2649
01:27:27,708 --> 01:27:31,179
CHILDREN TO SCHOOL, THE 

2650
01:27:31,179 --> 01:27:31,813
GOVERNMENT CAN'T GET INVOLVED; 

2651
01:27:31,813 --> 01:27:33,714
WHAT KIND OF MEDICAL CARE YOU 

2652
01:27:33,714 --> 01:27:35,416
CAN RECEIVE AT THE END OF LIFE 

2653
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:37,518
AS WELL AS WHETHER AND WHEN TO 

2654
01:27:37,518 --> 01:27:39,287
HAVE A FAMILY. 

2655
01:27:39,287 --> 01:27:39,921
AND IDEEPLY BELIEVE THAT ALL 

2656
01:27:39,921 --> 01:27:46,294
THESE CASES  SERVE AS A WORK OF 

2657
01:27:46,294 --> 01:27:47,895
PRIVACY RIGHTS THAT PROTECT ALL 

2658
01:27:47,895 --> 01:27:48,696
AMERICANS FROM OVERINVOLVEMENT 

2659
01:27:48,696 --> 01:27:49,263
OF THE GOVERNMENT IN THEIR 

2660
01:27:49,263 --> 01:27:51,199
LIVES.    

2661
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:52,800
AND TO ME, THAT'S 

2662
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:57,505
EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT.     

2663
01:27:57,505 --> 01:28:00,308
NEXT I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS 

2664
01:28:00,308 --> 01:28:03,277
PRESIDENT'S PROMISE TO APPOINT 

2665
01:28:03,277 --> 01:28:04,411
A NOMINEE BLESSED BY THE NRA. 

2666
01:28:04,411 --> 01:28:08,048
INREVIEWING  YOUR JUDICIAL 

2667
01:28:08,048 --> 01:28:10,284
OPINIONS AND DOCUMENTS, IT'S 

2668
01:28:10,284 --> 01:28:12,653
PRETTY CLEAR THAT YOUR VIEWS GO 

2669
01:28:12,653 --> 01:28:14,254
WELL BEYOND SIMPLY BEING PRO-

2670
01:28:14,254 --> 01:28:15,189
GUN. 

2671
01:28:15,189 --> 01:28:17,492
AND I'D LIKE TOSTRAIGHTEN THAT 

2672
01:28:17,492 --> 01:28:17,692
OUT. 

2673
01:28:17,692 --> 01:28:20,061
IT'S MYUNDERSTANDING THAT 

2674
01:28:20,061 --> 01:28:20,694
DURING A LECTURE AT NOTRE DAME 

2675
01:28:20,694 --> 01:28:23,931
LAW SCHOOL YOU SAID YOU WOULD 

2676
01:28:23,931 --> 01:28:24,431
BE THE QUOTE, FIRST TO 

2677
01:28:24,431 --> 01:28:28,736
ACKNOWLEDGE  THAT MOST OTHER 

2678
01:28:28,736 --> 01:28:30,938
LOWER JUDGES -- COURT JUDGES 

2679
01:28:30,938 --> 01:28:33,040
HAVE DISAGREED WITH YOUR VIEWS 

2680
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:35,810
ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT. 

2681
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:38,813
FOR EXAMPLE, IN DISTRICT OF 

2682
01:28:38,813 --> 01:28:42,150
COLUMBIA VHELLER YOU WROTE THAT 

2683
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:42,717
UNLESS GUNS WERE REGULATED 

2684
01:28:42,717 --> 01:28:44,819
EITHER AT THE TIME OF THE 

2685
01:28:44,819 --> 01:28:45,653
CONSTITUTION WAS WRITTEN OR 

2686
01:28:45,653 --> 01:28:46,186
TRADITIONALLY THROUGHOUT 

2687
01:28:46,186 --> 01:28:47,288
HISTORY THEY CANNOT BE 

2688
01:28:47,288 --> 01:28:51,225
REGULATED NOW.    

2689
01:28:51,225 --> 01:28:53,460
IN YOUR OWN WORDS GUN LAWS ARE 

2690
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:55,763
UNCONSTITUTIONAL UNLESS THEY 

2691
01:28:55,763 --> 01:28:56,763
ARE QUOTE, TRADITIONAL OR 

2692
01:28:56,763 --> 01:29:01,202
COMMON IN THE UNITED STATES.    

2693
01:29:01,202 --> 01:29:03,604
YOU CONCLUDE THAT HAD BANNING 

2694
01:29:03,604 --> 01:29:06,107
ASSAULT WEAPONS IS 

2695
01:29:06,107 --> 01:29:06,707
UNCONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE THEY 

2696
01:29:06,707 --> 01:29:07,274
HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY BEEN 

2697
01:29:07,274 --> 01:29:08,543
BANNED.    

2698
01:29:08,543 --> 01:29:12,280
AND THIS LOGIC  MEANS THAT EVEN 

2699
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:12,914
AS WEAPONS BECOME MORE ADVANCED 

2700
01:29:12,914 --> 01:29:15,183
AND MORE DANGEROUS, THEY CANNOT 

2701
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:20,221
BE REGULATED.     

2702
01:29:20,221 --> 01:29:22,723
A CONSERVATIVE JUDGE FROM THE 

2703
01:29:22,723 --> 01:29:26,327
SEVENTH CIRCUIT CONCLUDED THAT 

2704
01:29:26,327 --> 01:29:28,696
HAD THAT REASONING WAS ABSURD 

2705
01:29:28,696 --> 01:29:31,999
AND POINTED OUT THAT A LAW'S 

2706
01:29:31,999 --> 01:29:32,633
EXISTENCE CAN'T BE THE SOURCE 

2707
01:29:32,633 --> 01:29:37,805
OF ITS OWN CONSTITUTIONAL 

2708
01:29:37,805 --> 01:29:38,071
VALIDITY. 

2709
01:29:38,071 --> 01:29:39,273
I'M LEFT WITH THE FACT THAT 

2710
01:29:39,273 --> 01:29:40,207
YOUR REASONING IS FAR OUTSIDE 

2711
01:29:40,207 --> 01:29:44,411
THE MAINSTREAM OF LEGAL THOUGHT 

2712
01:29:44,411 --> 01:29:44,978
AND THAT IT SIR PASSES THE 

2713
01:29:44,978 --> 01:29:48,316
VIEWS OF JUSTICE IS A LEAH WHO 

2714
01:29:48,316 --> 01:29:51,285
WAS CLEARLY A PRO GUN JUSTICE. 

2715
01:29:51,285 --> 01:29:52,486
EVENHE UNDERSTOOD THAT WEAPONS 

2716
01:29:52,486 --> 01:29:56,490
THAT ARE LIKE M 16 RIFLES OR 

2717
01:29:56,490 --> 01:29:59,192
WEAPONS THAT ARE MOST USEFUL IN 

2718
01:29:59,192 --> 01:30:00,862
MILITARY SERVICE CAN IN FACT, 

2719
01:30:00,862 --> 01:30:02,363
BE REGULATED. 

2720
01:30:02,363 --> 01:30:04,332
AND THERE'S NOQUESTION THAT 

2721
01:30:04,332 --> 01:30:09,170
ASSAULT WEAPONS  LIKE THE AR 

2722
01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:09,803
15, WERE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED 

2723
01:30:09,803 --> 01:30:11,806
TO BE LIKE THE M 16.   

2724
01:30:11,806 --> 01:30:14,374
UNITED STATES MAKES UP 4%  OF 

2725
01:30:14,374 --> 01:30:19,514
THE WORLDWIDE POPULATION.   

2726
01:30:19,514 --> 01:30:20,281
BUT WE OWN 42% OF THE WORLD'S 

2727
01:30:20,281 --> 01:30:24,852
GUNS.     

2728
01:30:24,852 --> 01:30:28,322
SINCE 2012, WHEN 20, 1ST 

2729
01:30:28,322 --> 01:30:30,024
GRADERS AND 6 SCHOOL EMPLOYEES 

2730
01:30:30,024 --> 01:30:32,727
WERE KILLED AT SANDY HOOK 

2731
01:30:32,727 --> 01:30:36,263
ELEMENTARY THERE HAVE BEEN 273 

2732
01:30:36,263 --> 01:30:38,933
SCHOOL SHOOTINGS.    

2733
01:30:38,933 --> 01:30:43,037
THIS IS AN AVERAGE OF 5 

2734
01:30:43,037 --> 01:30:43,637
SHOOTINGS EVERY MONTH, AND A 

2735
01:30:43,637 --> 01:30:50,545
TOTAL  OF 462 CHILDREN, 

2736
01:30:50,545 --> 01:30:51,546
TEENAGERS, TEACHERS AND STAFF 

2737
01:30:51,546 --> 01:30:55,583
-SHOT  AND 152 KILLED.    

2738
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:59,520
I CARE A LOT ABOUT THIS. 

2739
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:00,788
I AUTHORED ASSAULTWEAPONS 

2740
01:31:00,788 --> 01:31:02,990
LEGISLATION THAT BECAME LAW FOR 

2741
01:31:02,990 --> 01:31:03,424
10 YEARS    

2742
01:31:03,424 --> 01:31:06,928
AND I'VE SEEN THE DESTRUCTION. 

2743
01:31:06,928 --> 01:31:10,064
IFTHE SUPREME COURT  WERE TO 

2744
01:31:10,064 --> 01:31:12,933
ADOPT YOUR REASONING , I FEAR 

2745
01:31:12,933 --> 01:31:18,606
THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS  WOULD 

2746
01:31:18,606 --> 01:31:19,006
CONTINUE TO GROW. 

2747
01:31:19,006 --> 01:31:21,175
ANDCITIZENS WOULD BE RENDERED 

2748
01:31:21,175 --> 01:31:24,045
POWERLESS IN ENACTING SENSIBLE 

2749
01:31:24,045 --> 01:31:25,980
GUN LAWS.  

2750
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:26,647
SO THIS IS A BIG PART OF MY 

2751
01:31:26,647 --> 01:31:28,849
VERY HONEST CONCERN.      

2752
01:31:28,849 --> 01:31:32,320
YOU'RE BEING NOMINATED FOR A 

2753
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:32,753
PRIVATE TALL SEAT. 

2754
01:31:32,753 --> 01:31:35,122
IT WOULD LIKELY BE THEDECIDING 

2755
01:31:35,122 --> 01:31:38,292
VOTE ON FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES. 

2756
01:31:38,292 --> 01:31:40,995
SO  DURING YOUR TIME IN THE 

2757
01:31:40,995 --> 01:31:43,064
WHITE HOUSE WHEN YOU WERE STAFF 

2758
01:31:43,064 --> 01:31:47,001
SECRETARY, SOME PEOPLE REGARD 

2759
01:31:47,001 --> 01:31:47,501
IT AS KIND OF A MONITOR 

2760
01:31:47,501 --> 01:31:49,036
MONITORING THINGS GOING IN AND 

2761
01:31:49,036 --> 01:31:51,439
GOING OUT, BUT I THINK IT'S 

2762
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:51,739
MUCH MORE. 

2763
01:31:51,739 --> 01:31:53,508
AND YOUYOURSELF HAVE SAID THAT 

2764
01:31:53,508 --> 01:32:00,314
THAT'S THE PERIOD  OF MY 

2765
01:32:00,314 --> 01:32:02,916
GREATEST GROWTH, AND  SO YOU 

2766
01:32:02,916 --> 01:32:06,319
LOOK AT IT AND THE ONLY WAY WE 

2767
01:32:06,319 --> 01:32:08,355
CAN LOOK AT IT IS TO UNDERSTAND 

2768
01:32:08,355 --> 01:32:09,156
THE DOCUMENTS. 

2769
01:32:09,156 --> 01:32:11,626
AND IT'S VERY, VERYDIFFICULT.   

2770
01:32:11,626 --> 01:32:14,395
UM, I DON'T WANT TO TAKE TOO 

2771
01:32:14,395 --> 01:32:17,431
MUCH TIME, BUT  WE'VE HEARD A 

2772
01:32:17,431 --> 01:32:22,903
LOT OF NOISE .  BEHIND THE NOISE

2773
01:32:22,903 --> 01:32:24,772
IS REALLY A VERY SINCERE BELIEF 

2774
01:32:24,772 --> 01:32:26,941
THAT IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO KEEP 

2775
01:32:26,941 --> 01:32:32,980
IN THIS COUNTRY  WHICH IS MULTI 

2776
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:35,449
ETHNIC, MULTI RELIGIOUS, MULTI 

2777
01:32:35,449 --> 01:32:38,252
ECONOMIC  A COURT THAT REALLY 

2778
01:32:38,252 --> 01:32:40,821
SERVES THE PEOPLE.    

2779
01:32:40,821 --> 01:32:41,989
AND SERVES THIS GREAT 

2780
01:32:41,989 --> 01:32:42,289
DEMOCRACY. 

2781
01:32:42,289 --> 01:32:44,258
AND  THAT'S MY WORRY.     

2782
01:32:44,258 --> 01:32:46,961
THAT'S MY WORRY.      

2783
01:32:46,961 --> 01:32:50,030
SO I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR 

2784
01:32:50,030 --> 01:32:50,597
STATEMENT AND ANSWERING THE 

2785
01:32:50,597 --> 01:32:52,366
QUESTIONS. 

2786
01:32:52,366 --> 01:32:54,635
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN.   

2787
01:32:54,635 --> 01:32:54,768

2789
01:32:56,303 --> 01:32:56,570

ORGANIZING THIS HEARING. 

2794
01:33:03,177 --> 01:33:04,044
THIS HAS BEEN THEMOST THOROUGH 

2795
01:33:04,044 --> 01:33:06,013
SUPREME COURT CONFIRMATION 

2796
01:33:06,013 --> 01:33:07,782
PROCESS THAT I'VE EVER

01:33:07,782 --> 01:33:08,381
PARTICIPATED IN. 

2798

WE'VERECEIVED MORE THAN TWICE

01:34:34,735 --> 01:34:35,168
VERY MUCH NOTABLE. 

2840
01:34:35,168 --> 01:34:36,603
AT ONLY39 YEARS OF AGE YOU KNEW 

2841
01:34:36,603 --> 01:34:39,173
MORE ABOUT THE LAW THAN MOST 

2842
01:34:39,173 --> 01:34:40,440
LAWYERS WHO HAVE PRACTICED FOR

01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:43,878

PRE. 

3209
01:48:03,609 --> 01:48:08,048

YOU'VE TAKEN THEPOSITION THAT 

3223
01:48:36,209 --> 01:48:36,809

BURDENED WITH A CRIMINAL OR 

3225
01:48:38,144 --> 01:48:38,745
CIVIL INVESTIGATION WHILE IN 

3226
01:48:38,745 --> 01:48:43,383
OFFICE.      

3227
01:48:43,383 --> 01:48:43,683
[INAUDIBLE] 

3228
01:48:43,683 --> 01:48:44,317
NOW WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS  

3229
01:48:44,317 --> 01:48:51,291
DECLARED IN THE LAST 24 HOURS  

3230
01:48:51,291 --> 01:48:52,525
THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 

3231
01:48:52,525 --> 01:48:53,326
SHOULDN'T PROSECUTE 

3232
01:48:53,326 --> 01:48:57,163

01:49:02,035 --> 01:49:04,237
I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE 

3236
01:49:04,237 --> 01:49:07,340
THAT YOUR VIEWS ON THIS SUBJECT 

3237
01:49:07,340 --> 01:49:07,873
ESCAPED THE ATTENTION OF 

3238
01:49:07,873 --> 01:49:12,312
PRESIDENT TRUMP  WHO SEEMS 

3239
01:49:12,312 --> 01:49:13,413
INCREASINGLY FIXATED ON HIS OWN 

3240
01:49:13,413 --> 01:49:16,116

3243
01:49:20,420 --> 01:49:21,888
LOOK TO YOUR RECORD ON THE 

3244
01:49:21,888 --> 01:49:23,757
BENCH, ALL OF US REPUBLICANS 

3245
01:49:23,757 --> 01:49:24,324
AND DEMOCRATS AGREE THAT WE 

3246
01:49:24,324 --> 01:49:25,058
SHOULD.    

3247
01:49:25,058 --> 01:49:28,328
INDEED YOUR 12 YEARS ON THE

HEARINGS. 

3251
01:49:33,766 --> 01:49:35,668
BUT THEUNKNOWN LOOMS EVEN 

3252
01:49:35,668 --> 01:49:37,337
LARGER.     

3253
01:49:37,337 --> 01:49:40,206

3254
01:49:40,206 --> 01:49:43,776

3256
01:49:46,947 --> 01:49:47,547
AND PARTISAN CONTROVERSIES OF 

3257
01:49:47,547 --> 01:49:49,683
OUR TIME. 

3258
01:49:49,683 --> 01:49:51,317
DURING THIS TIME YOU SHARED 

3259
01:49:51,317 --> 01:49:52,952
YOUR PERSONAL VIEW ON ISSUES 

3260
01:49:52,952 --> 01:49:56,322
WITHOUT REGARD TO RESTRICTION 

3261
01:49:56,322 --> 01:49:59,492
IMPOSED BY PRECEDENT.    

3262
01:49:59,492 --> 01:50:00,226
AND IT'S PRECISELY THOSE VIEWS 

3263
01:50:00,226 --> 01:50:03,329
THAT ARE BEING HIDDEN FROM US 

3264
01:50:03,329 --> 01:50:03,562
TODAY. 

3265
01:50:03,562 --> 01:50:06,266
THECOMMITTEE'S SUPREME COURT 

3266
01:50:06,266 --> 01:50:07,667
HEARINGS ARE MEANT TO BE AN 

3267
01:50:07,667 --> 01:50:10,270
UNSPEERING EXAMINATION OF A 

3268
01:50:10,270 --> 01:50:13,840
NOMINEE TO A LIFETIME 

3269
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:15,208
APPOINTMENT TO OUR HIGHEST 

3270
01:50:15,208 --> 01:50:15,441
COURT. 

3271
01:50:15,441 --> 01:50:20,313
THEY'RE INTENDED TO GIVETHE 

3272
01:50:20,313 --> 01:50:20,913
AMERICAN PEOPLE ALL, ALL, ALL 

3273
01:50:20,913 --> 01:50:21,914
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE A GENUINE 

3274
01:50:21,914 --> 01:50:24,217
OPPORTUNITY TO SCRUTINIZE THE 

3275
01:50:24,217 --> 01:50:30,724
NOMINEE'S JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY, 

3276
01:50:30,724 --> 01:50:31,091
AND CHARACTER. 

3277
01:50:31,091 --> 01:50:33,893
BECAUSE OF CONFIRMEDWITH A 

3278
01:50:33,893 --> 01:50:36,395
STROKE OF A PEN A NOMINEE MAY 

3279
01:50:36,395 --> 01:50:39,232
IMPACT THEIR LIVES FOR A 

3280
01:50:39,232 --> 01:50:39,665
GENERATION OR MORE. 

3281
01:50:39,665 --> 01:50:42,068
AND HOW FARWE'VE FALLEN. 

3282
01:50:42,068 --> 01:50:44,537
JUDGE KAVANAUGH,SO MANY THINGS 

3283
01:50:44,537 --> 01:50:48,408
WRONG WITH THIS MIGHT TEE'S 

3284
01:50:48,408 --> 01:50:50,376
VETTING OF YOUR RECORD. 

3285
01:50:50,376 --> 01:50:52,845
IT IS HARD TO KNOWWHERE TO 

3286
01:50:52,845 --> 01:50:53,847
BEGIN. 

3287
01:50:53,847 --> 01:50:54,948
I'VE BEEN ONTHIS COMMITTEE IN 

3288
01:50:54,948 --> 01:50:56,850
BOTH REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC 

3289
01:50:56,850 --> 01:50:57,150
LEADERSHIP. 

3290
01:50:57,150 --> 01:50:58,183
I NEVER THOUGHT THECOMMITTEE 

3291
01:50:58,183 --> 01:51:00,320
WOULD SINK TO THIS.    

3292
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:02,388
IN FACT,  YOU SHOULDN'T BE 

3293
01:51:02,388 --> 01:51:03,957
SITTING IN FRONT OF US TODAY.   

3294
01:51:03,957 --> 01:51:08,428
YOU SHOULD BE SITTING IN FRONT 

3295
01:51:08,428 --> 01:51:09,229
OF US ONLY AFTER WE'VE 

3296
01:51:09,229 --> 01:51:12,432
COMPLETED A REVIEW OF YOUR 

3297
01:51:12,432 --> 01:51:15,235
RECORD, YOUR VETTING IS LESS 

3298
01:51:15,235 --> 01:51:17,070
THAN 10% COMPLETE. 

3299
01:51:17,070 --> 01:51:21,207
IN CRITICAL WAYS OURCOMMITTEE 

3300
01:51:21,207 --> 01:51:21,840
IS ABANDONING ITS TRADITION OF 

3301
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:27,213
VETTING SUPREME COURT NOMINEES. 

3302
01:51:27,213 --> 01:51:28,214
FIRST OURREPUBLICAN FRIENDS 

3303
01:51:28,214 --> 01:51:30,150
REFUSE TO REQUEST RECORDS FROM 

3304
01:51:30,150 --> 01:51:30,750
YOUR 3 YEARS AS WHITE HOUSE 

3305
01:51:30,750 --> 01:51:34,054
STAFF SECRETARY.     

3306
01:51:34,054 --> 01:51:36,355
EVEN THOUGH YOU  DESCRIBED 

3307
01:51:36,355 --> 01:51:39,225
THOSE AS THE MOST FORMATIVE FOR 

3308
01:51:39,225 --> 01:51:41,227
YOU AS A JUDGE.    

3309
01:51:41,227 --> 01:51:44,330
WHEN YOU PROVIDE ADVICE ON ANY 

3310
01:51:44,330 --> 01:51:44,863
ISSUE THAT MAY CROSS THE 

3311
01:51:44,863 --> 01:51:48,034
PRESIDENT'S DESK.   

3312
01:51:48,034 --> 01:51:52,205
NOW, WE KNOW  THOSE ISSUES 

3313
01:51:52,205 --> 01:51:53,973
INCLUDED ABORTION, SAME SEX 

3314
01:51:53,973 --> 01:52:00,313
MARRIAGE,    AND TORTURE, AND 

3315
01:52:00,313 --> 01:52:01,481
TORTURE. 

3316
01:52:01,481 --> 01:52:03,015
BUT 6 WEEKS AGO SENATE 

3317
01:52:03,015 --> 01:52:05,285
REPUBLICANS HELD A PRIVATE 

3318
01:52:05,285 --> 01:52:06,819
MEETING WITH THE WHITE HOUSE 

3319
01:52:06,819 --> 01:52:08,287
COUNSEL WHO IS HERE TODAY AND 

3320
01:52:08,287 --> 01:52:09,422
HOURS LATER THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

3321
01:52:09,422 --> 01:52:10,189
WERE TOLD THOSE RECORDS WOULD 

3322
01:52:10,189 --> 01:52:15,528
BE OFF LIMITS.      

3323
01:52:15,528 --> 01:52:18,031
AND SECOND A STARK DEPARTURE 

3324
01:52:18,031 --> 01:52:20,233
FROM COMMITTEE PRECEDENT. 

3325
01:52:20,233 --> 01:52:21,334
THECOMMITTEE PRECEDENT I'VE 

3326
01:52:21,334 --> 01:52:26,239
SEEN FOR 44 YEARS. 

3327
01:52:26,239 --> 01:52:26,872
THE CHAIRMANSAID -- [INAUDIBLE] 

3328
01:52:26,872 --> 01:52:29,242
NOT ONLY DID IT ADMIT ALL 1 

3329
01:52:29,242 --> 01:52:33,313
MILLION RECORDS FROM YOUR 3 

3330
01:52:33,313 --> 01:52:36,216
YEARS AS STAFF SECRETARY IT DID 

3331
01:52:36,216 --> 01:52:39,319
NOT EVEN REQUEST THE PRIVILEGED 

3332
01:52:39,319 --> 01:52:39,786
LAW. 

3333
01:52:39,786 --> 01:52:41,454
THAT MEANS THIS COMMITTEE IS IN 

3334
01:52:41,454 --> 01:52:44,156
THE DARK AS TO WHAT SPECIFIC 

3335
01:52:44,156 --> 01:52:44,623
DOCUMENTS [INAUDIBLE] 

3336
01:52:44,623 --> 01:52:46,226
AND WHY? 

3337
01:52:46,226 --> 01:52:48,328
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IS 

3338
01:52:48,328 --> 01:52:50,262
BEING HIDDEN. 

3339
01:52:50,262 --> 01:52:51,830
SUCH A MOVE ISSIMPLY -- 

3340
01:52:51,830 --> 01:52:52,332
[INAUDIBLE] 

3341
01:52:52,332 --> 01:52:55,501
TRANCE PARTNER. 

3342
01:52:55,501 --> 01:52:58,938
THIRD, TE ARCHIVESTOLD US 

3343
01:52:58,938 --> 01:52:59,572
TEXTED NOT PRODUCE THIS PARTIAL 

3344
01:52:59,572 --> 01:53:03,209
RECORDS REQUEST UNTIL THE END 

3345
01:53:03,209 --> 01:53:04,376
OF OCTOBER, THAT'S THE NON-

3346
01:53:04,376 --> 01:53:27,967
PARTISAN ARCHIVES.      

3347
01:53:27,967 --> 01:53:31,137
. 

3348
01:53:31,137 --> 01:53:32,605
>>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I DO NOT 

3349
01:53:32,605 --> 01:53:33,740
INTEND AT ANY POINT TO CONTINUE 

3350
01:53:33,740 --> 01:53:36,409
WITH WHAT I HAVE TO SAY WITH 

3351
01:53:36,409 --> 01:53:39,245
SUCH INTERRUPTIONS, I DON'T 

3352
01:53:39,245 --> 01:53:39,812
CARE WHOSE SIDE THEY'RE ON. 

3353
01:53:39,812 --> 01:53:41,814
NOW, THEARCHIVES HAVE SAID THEY 

3354
01:53:41,814 --> 01:53:43,583
COULD NOT PRODUCE THOSE PARTIAL 

3355
01:53:43,583 --> 01:53:44,550
RECORDS REQUEST UNTIL THE END 

3356
01:53:44,550 --> 01:53:45,051
OF OCTOBER.    

3357
01:53:45,051 --> 01:53:48,321
SURELY I WOULD THINK THAT THE 

3358
01:53:48,321 --> 01:53:51,324
UNITED STATES SENATE COULD WAIT 

3359
01:53:51,324 --> 01:53:52,458
UNTIL THEN EVEN IF IT MEANS A 

3360
01:53:52,458 --> 01:53:56,229
SUPREME COURT WITH 8 JUSTICES 

3361
01:53:56,229 --> 01:53:58,431
FOR A SHORT TIME. 

3362
01:53:58,431 --> 01:54:00,233
AFTER ALL, SENATORREPUBLICANS  

3363
01:54:00,233 --> 01:54:03,203
ESTABLISHED THE TRADITION OF 

3364
01:54:03,203 --> 01:54:08,107
HAVING JUST 8 JUDGES, 8 

3365
01:54:08,107 --> 01:54:09,309
JUSTICES, THEY DID THAT WITH 

3366
01:54:09,309 --> 01:54:13,045
THEIR TREATMENT OF CHIEF JUDGE 

3367
01:54:13,045 --> 01:54:15,315
GARLAND AND SHOWED THEY WERE 

3368
01:54:15,315 --> 01:54:15,915
WILLING TO HAVE PATIENCE WITH 

3369
01:54:15,915 --> 01:54:19,185
FILLING SUPREME COURT VACANCIES 

3370
01:54:19,185 --> 01:54:19,785
WHEN THE FIRST TIME EVER THEY 

3371
01:54:19,785 --> 01:54:22,922
REFUSE  TO HAVE A VOTE ON THE 

3372
01:54:22,922 --> 01:54:23,589
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE EITHER UP 

3373
01:54:23,589 --> 01:54:24,891
OR DOWN.     

3374
01:54:24,891 --> 01:54:25,959
DURING A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 

3375
01:54:25,959 --> 01:54:27,227
YEAR.    

3376
01:54:27,227 --> 01:54:29,428
AND I'VE BEEN HERE WHEN THEY 

3377
01:54:29,428 --> 01:54:33,333
HAVE HAD  IN THE PAST SUCH 

3378
01:54:33,333 --> 01:54:35,001
VOTES. 

3379
01:54:35,001 --> 01:54:42,642
BUT  REPUBLICANS CAST ASIDE THE 

3380
01:54:42,642 --> 01:54:43,242
ARCHIVES, SWAPPED THE REVIEW 

3381
01:54:43,242 --> 01:54:45,511
PROCESS [INAUDIBLE]    

3382
01:54:45,511 --> 01:54:47,213
FOR A PARTISAN ONE.     

3383
01:54:47,213 --> 01:54:51,184
AND I THINK YOU ONLY HAVE TO 

3384
01:54:51,184 --> 01:54:52,218
LOOK AT WATERGATE TO SEE WHY WE 

3385
01:54:52,218 --> 01:54:59,792
HAVE THAT NON-PARTISAN PROCESS. 

3386
01:54:59,792 --> 01:55:01,194
IT'S FOLLOWED EVERY NOMINATION 

3387
01:55:01,194 --> 01:55:04,564
SINCE WATER GATE UNTIL TODAY.   

3388
01:55:04,564 --> 01:55:07,200
AND MY QUESTION SILL RECURS, 

3389
01:55:07,200 --> 01:55:08,200
WHAT IS BEING HIDDEN? 

3390
01:55:08,200 --> 01:55:10,737
AND WHY?

3391
01:55:10,737 --> 01:55:15,208
EVERY WHITE HOUSE RECORD THAT 

3392
01:55:15,208 --> 01:55:16,943
WE'VE RECEIVED WAS HAND PICKED 

3393
01:55:16,943 --> 01:55:19,645
BY YOUR DEPUTY IN THE BUSH 

3394
01:55:19,645 --> 01:55:21,214
WHITE HOUSE, A HYPER CONFLICTED 

3395
01:55:21,214 --> 01:55:24,217
LAWYER OF LAW REPRESENTS A HALF 

3396
01:55:24,217 --> 01:55:25,685
DOZEN TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 

3397
01:55:25,685 --> 01:55:27,186
OFFICIALS  HONOR UNDER 

3398
01:55:27,186 --> 01:55:28,187
INVESTIGATION BY PROSECUTION IN 

3399
01:55:28,187 --> 01:55:33,626
THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.      

3400
01:55:33,626 --> 01:55:35,495
AND THESE LAWYERS DECIDED WHICH 

3401
01:55:35,495 --> 01:55:37,663
OF YOUR RECORDS THE SENATE, BUT 

3402
01:55:37,663 --> 01:55:38,297
MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE AMERICAN 

3403
01:55:38,297 --> 01:55:39,331
PEOPLE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE GET 

3404
01:55:39,331 --> 01:55:42,402
TO SEE.     

3405
01:55:42,402 --> 01:55:44,203
FORTH COME THOSE DOCUMENTS THAT 

3406
01:55:44,203 --> 01:55:47,073
HAD BEEN PROVIDED CONTAIN 

3407
01:55:47,073 --> 01:55:49,042
APPARENT ALTERATIONS AND 

3408
01:55:49,042 --> 01:55:49,475
OMISSIONS WITH ZERO 

3409
01:55:49,475 --> 01:55:54,547
EXPLANATION.      

3410
01:55:54,547 --> 01:55:56,049
NO COURT IN THIS COUNTRY 

3411
01:55:56,049 --> 01:55:58,751
CERTAINLY NO COURT THAT I EVER 

3412
01:55:58,751 --> 01:55:59,284
ARGUED CASES BEFORE WOULD 

3413
01:55:59,284 --> 01:56:00,186
ACCEPT THIS AS A LEGITIMATE 

3414
01:56:00,186 --> 01:56:04,490
DOCUMENT PRODUCTION.      

3415
01:56:04,490 --> 01:56:05,457
AND UNITED STATES SENATE 

3416
01:56:05,457 --> 01:56:08,728
SHOULDN'T EITHER.      

3417
01:56:08,728 --> 01:56:12,331
AND 5TH, MORE THAN 40% OF THE 

3418
01:56:12,331 --> 01:56:15,500
DOCUMENTS WE HAVE RECEIVED 

3419
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:16,034
ALMOST 190,000 PAGES ARE 

3420
01:56:16,034 --> 01:56:17,637
CONSIDERED COMMITTEE 

3421

CONFIDENTIAL BY THE CHAIRMAN.   

3422
01:56:19,405 --> 01:56:22,875
FOR THE VAST MAJORITY THEN 

3423
01:56:22,875 --> 01:56:23,508
THERE'S NOT EVEN A CONCEIVABLE 

3424
01:56:23,508 --> 01:56:27,547
ARGUMENT RESTRICTIVE.      

3425
01:56:27,547 --> 01:56:31,484
COMPARE THIS TO THE 860 

3426
01:56:31,484 --> 01:56:33,186

PARTISAN ARCHIVES NOT BY THIS 

3430
01:56:38,224 --> 01:56:43,629
COMMITTEE.      

3431
01:56:43,629 --> 01:56:45,831
AND BESIDE 99% OF OUR RECORDS. 

3432
01:56:45,831 --> 01:56:47,099
AND 6 AND FINALLY WELEARN THAT 

3433
01:56:47,099 --> 01:56:51,204
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CLAIMING 

3434
01:56:51,204 --> 01:56:51,771
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE OVER AN 

3435
01:56:51,771 --> 01:56:52,371
ADDITIONAL 102,000 PAGES OF 

3436
01:56:52,371 --> 01:56:56,075
YOUR RECORDS.      

3437
01:56:56,075 --> 01:56:57,577
SUCH A BLANKET ASSERTION 

3438
01:56:57,577 --> 01:56:59,611
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE HANDLE IS 

3439
01:56:59,611 --> 01:57:00,479
SIMPLY UNHEARD OF IN THE 

3440
01:57:00,479 --> 01:57:03,316
HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. 

3441
01:57:03,316 --> 01:57:06,818
THE REASONIT'S UNHEARD OF IS 

3442
01:57:06,818 --> 01:57:07,419
BECAUSE IT IS SO OUTRAGEOUS. 

3443
01:57:07,419 --> 01:57:08,454
THE LAST TIME APRESIDENT 

3444
01:57:08,454 --> 01:57:12,325
ATTEMPTED TO HIDE HIS SUPREME 

3445
01:57:12,325 --> 01:57:13,859
COURT NOMINEE'S RECORDS BY 

3446
01:57:13,859 --> 01:57:15,895
INVOKING EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE 

3447
01:57:15,895 --> 01:57:16,596
WAS WHEN PRESIDENT REAGAN DID 

3448
01:57:16,596 --> 01:57:17,997
THIS.      

3449
01:57:17,997 --> 01:57:21,501
BUT THEN REPUBLICANS AND 

3450
01:57:21,501 --> 01:57:24,369
DEMOCRATS CAME TOGETHER , WE 

3451
01:57:24,369 --> 01:57:28,207
DEMANDED THE DOCUMENTS BE 

3452
01:57:28,207 --> 01:57:29,642
RELEASED AND THE PRESIDENT SAID 

3453
01:57:29,642 --> 01:57:32,545
OKAY, AND THEY WERE RELEASED.   

3454
01:57:32,545 --> 01:57:37,917
BOY, HOW TIMES HAVE CHANGED.    

3455
01:57:37,917 --> 01:57:40,019
AND 7TH TO DATE WE'VE RECEIVED 

3456
01:57:40,019 --> 01:57:40,486
LESS THAN HAVE OF THE 

3457
01:57:40,486 --> 01:57:43,723
CHAIRMAN'S PARTIAL RECORDS 

3458
01:57:43,723 --> 01:57:44,323
REQUEST, MEANING WE'RE MOVING 

3459
01:57:44,323 --> 01:57:46,726
FORWARD EVEN THOUGH WE'VE 

3460
01:57:46,726 --> 01:57:48,627
RECEIVED A FRACTION OF THE 

3461
01:57:48,627 --> 01:57:50,195
RECORDS EVEN REPUBLICANS CLAIM 

3462
01:57:50,195 --> 01:57:51,697
THEY NEEDED TODAY VET YOUR 

3463
01:57:51,697 --> 01:57:52,531
NOMINATION JUST A FEW WEEKS 

3464
01:57:52,531 --> 01:57:53,399
AGO. 

3465
01:57:53,399 --> 01:57:56,101
AND THEN WE RECEIVED AN 

3466
01:57:56,101 --> 01:57:56,702
ADDITIONAL 42,000 PAGES A FEW 

3467
01:57:56,702 --> 01:58:00,206
HOURS AGO.     

3468
01:58:00,206 --> 01:58:03,076
THE NOTION THAT ANYONE HAS 

3469
01:58:03,076 --> 01:58:03,709
PROPERLY REVIEWED THEM OR SEEN 

3470
01:58:03,709 --> 01:58:07,980
THEM AT ALL IS LAUGHABLE. 

3471
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:08,347
IT'SLAUGHABLE. 

3472
01:58:08,347 --> 01:58:11,750
IT DOESN'T PASS THEGIGGLE TEST. 

3473
01:58:11,750 --> 01:58:14,587
THAT ALONE WOULDBE REASON TO 

3474
01:58:14,587 --> 01:58:15,187
POSTPONE DURING NORMAL TIMES, 

3475
01:58:15,187 --> 01:58:17,823
BUT NOTHING ABOUT THIS IS 

3476
01:58:17,823 --> 01:58:18,090
NORMAL. 

3477
01:58:18,090 --> 01:58:22,562
ALL TOLD,  ONLY 4%, 4% OF YOUR 

3478
01:58:22,562 --> 01:58:24,197
WHITE HOUSE RECORD  HAS BEEN 

3479
01:58:24,197 --> 01:58:26,632
SHARED WITH THE PUBLIC.    

3480
01:58:26,632 --> 01:58:28,334
ONLY 7%  HAS BEEN MADE 

3481
01:58:28,334 --> 01:58:30,603
AVAILABLE TO THIS COMMITTEE.    

3482
01:58:30,603 --> 01:58:34,073
THE REST  REMAINS HIDDEN FROM 

3483
01:58:34,073 --> 01:58:40,179
SCRUTINY.      

3484
01:58:40,179 --> 01:58:42,648
COMPARE THIS TO THE 99% OF 

3485
01:58:42,648 --> 01:58:43,782
JUSTICE'S RECORD THAT WAS 

3486
01:58:43,782 --> 01:58:44,317
AVAILABLE [INAUDIBLE] 

3487
01:58:44,317 --> 01:58:48,321
AS A RESULT OF THE BIPARTISAN 

3488
01:58:48,321 --> 01:58:51,324
PROCESS I RAN WITHIN RANKING 

3489
01:58:51,324 --> 01:58:52,591
MEMBER JEFF SESSIONS. 

3490
01:58:52,591 --> 01:58:54,794
WHEN SENATOR SESSIONSAND I 

3491
01:58:54,794 --> 01:58:56,963
REQUESTED IT AND WE GOT 99%.    

3492
01:58:56,963 --> 01:59:03,402
WHAT IS BEING HIDDEN AND WHY?   

3493
01:59:03,402 --> 01:59:05,471
AND IF I'VE NOT BEEN CLEAR I 

3494
01:59:05,471 --> 01:59:07,272
WOULD BE SO NOW, TODAY THE 

3495
01:59:07,272 --> 01:59:09,675
SENATE IS NOT SIMPLY PHONING IN 

3496
01:59:09,675 --> 01:59:11,410
OUR BIDDING OBLIGATION, WE'RE 

3497
01:59:11,410 --> 01:59:12,211
DISCARDING IT.    

3498
01:59:12,211 --> 01:59:15,314
IT'S NOT ONLY SHAMEFUL, IT'S A 

3499
01:59:15,314 --> 01:59:20,219
SHAM.     

3500
01:59:20,219 --> 01:59:24,056
I FELT ON THE DAY WHEN I TOOK  

3501
01:59:24,056 --> 01:59:24,623
MY OATH OF OFFICE THE FIRST 

3502
01:59:24,623 --> 01:59:28,060
TIME 44 YEARS AGO,    I WAS 

3503
01:59:28,060 --> 01:59:30,996
TOLD BY BOTH THE REPUBLICAN AND 

3504
01:59:30,996 --> 01:59:34,132
DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP WITH THE 

3505
01:59:34,132 --> 01:59:35,100
SENATE, PEOPLE I HIGHLY 

3506
01:59:35,100 --> 01:59:38,470
RESPECTED  THE SENATE SHOULD BE 

3507
01:59:38,470 --> 01:59:39,472
AND CAN BE THE CONSCIOUS OF THE 

3508
01:59:39,472 --> 01:59:44,043
NATION.      

3509
01:59:44,043 --> 01:59:47,446
I'VE REPRESENTED VERMONT HERE 

3510
01:59:47,446 --> 01:59:49,749
FOR 44 YEARS, I SERVED WITH 

3511
01:59:49,749 --> 01:59:51,350
PRIDE HERE BELIEVING THAT THE 

3512
01:59:51,350 --> 01:59:52,351
SENATE CAN BE AND SHOULD BE  

3513
01:59:52,351 --> 01:59:56,455
THE CONSCIOUS OF THE NATION.    

3514
01:59:56,455 --> 01:59:59,792
TODAY WITH THIS HEARING, IT IS 

3515
01:59:59,792 --> 02:00:00,926
NOT.   

3516
02:00:00,926 --> 02:00:02,061
BEING THE CONSCIOUS OF THE 

3517
02:00:02,061 --> 02:00:03,095
NATION.     

3518
02:00:03,095 --> 02:00:06,432
AND FROM THE BITS AND PIECES OF 

3519
02:00:06,432 --> 02:00:08,667
YOUR RECORD WE'VE RECEIVED, IT 

3520
02:00:08,667 --> 02:00:10,636
APPEARS YOU PROVIDED MISLEADING 

3521
02:00:10,636 --> 02:00:11,871
TESTIMONY ABOUT YOUR 

3522
02:00:11,871 --> 02:00:15,574
INVOLVEMENT  AND CONTROVERSIAL 

3523
02:00:15,574 --> 02:00:16,309
ISSUES IN THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE 

3524
02:00:16,309 --> 02:00:18,610
DURING YOUR PREVIOUS 

3525
02:00:18,610 --> 02:00:19,911
CONFIRMATION HEARINGS, 

3526
02:00:19,911 --> 02:00:20,379
MISLEADING TESTIMONY. 

3527
02:00:20,379 --> 02:00:24,217
I ASKEDYOU ABOUT THESE CONCERNS 

3528
02:00:24,217 --> 02:00:29,021
LAST MONTH.  

3529
02:00:29,021 --> 02:00:33,192
AND I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW WE 

3530
02:00:33,192 --> 02:00:35,795
RETURN.     

3531
02:00:35,795 --> 02:00:37,396
FEARS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL 

3532
02:00:37,396 --> 02:00:40,299
NOT KNOW THE FULL TRUTH UNTIL 

3533
02:00:40,299 --> 02:00:43,402
YOUR RECORD IS PUBLIC AND 

3534
02:00:43,402 --> 02:00:44,270
UNFORTUNATELY REPUBLICANS HAVE 

3535
02:00:44,270 --> 02:00:46,372
DONE THEIR BEST AND YOU HAD YOU 

3536
02:00:46,372 --> 02:00:46,872
A GAPING HOLES SPANNING 

3537
02:00:46,872 --> 02:00:51,210
MULTIPLE YEARS OF YOUR CAREER, 

3538
02:00:51,210 --> 02:00:53,612
DEEPLY INFLUENCED BY YOUR OWN 

3539
02:00:53,612 --> 02:00:56,348
WORDS  YOU'RE THINKING AS 

3540
02:00:56,348 --> 02:00:59,151
JUDGE. 

3541
02:00:59,151 --> 02:01:02,054
ANY CLAIM THIS HAS BEEN A 

3542
02:01:02,054 --> 02:01:03,655
TRANSPARENT PROCESS, THIS IS 

3543
02:01:03,655 --> 02:01:07,159
THE MOST INCOMPLETE, MOST 

3544
02:01:07,159 --> 02:01:07,726
PARTISAN, LEAST TRANSPARENT 

3545
02:01:07,726 --> 02:01:10,663
VETTING FOR ANY SUPREME COURT  

3546
02:01:10,663 --> 02:01:15,368
NOMINEE I HAVE EVER SEEN AND 

3547
02:01:15,368 --> 02:01:16,269
I'VE SEEN MORE OF THOSE THAN 

3548
02:01:16,269 --> 02:01:23,476
ANY PERSON SERVING TODAY.    

3549
02:01:23,476 --> 02:01:24,310
FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH, I HOPE YOU 

3550
02:01:24,310 --> 02:01:27,445
USE IT TO ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS 

3551
02:01:27,445 --> 02:01:28,781
DIRECTLY, CLEARLY AND HONESTLY 

3552
02:01:28,781 --> 02:01:31,517
BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

3553
02:01:31,517 --> 02:01:32,384
HAVE REAL CONCERNS ABOUT HOW 

3554
02:01:32,384 --> 02:01:33,218
YOUR CONFIRMAION WILL AFFECT 

3555
02:01:33,218 --> 02:01:36,922
THEIR LIVES. 

3556
02:01:36,922 --> 02:01:39,224
I'LL CON CLUE WITH THIS,THE 

3557
02:01:39,224 --> 02:01:42,594
SUPREME COURT IS A GUARANTEE OR 

3558
02:01:42,594 --> 02:01:46,332
OF OUR LIBERTIES AND OUR 

3559
02:01:46,332 --> 02:01:48,334
REPUBLIC. 

3560
02:01:48,334 --> 02:01:48,968
FEW I WOULD ARGUE AREWORTHY OF 

3561
02:01:48,968 --> 02:01:51,337
TAKING THE SEAT ONLY THOSE WITH 

3562
02:01:51,337 --> 02:01:52,505
UNIMPEACHABLE INTEGRITY, ONLY 

3563
02:01:52,505 --> 02:01:55,541
THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT TRUTH IS 

3564
02:01:55,541 --> 02:01:56,308
MORE IMPORTANT THAN PARTY, ONLY 

3565
02:01:56,308 --> 02:01:57,309
THOSE COMMITTED TO UPHOLDING 

3566
02:01:57,309 --> 02:01:59,245
THE RIGHTS OF ALL AMERICANS, 

3567
02:01:59,245 --> 02:02:03,015
NOT JUST THOSE IN POWER.    

3568
02:02:03,015 --> 02:02:09,220
AS YOU KNOW,    AS SCRIBBED 

3569
02:02:09,220 --> 02:02:12,224
ABOVE THE COURT'S ENTRANCE IS 

3570
02:02:12,224 --> 02:02:14,827
EQUAL, EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. 

3571
02:02:14,827 --> 02:02:15,427
FOR THE MILLIONS OFAMERICANS 

3572
02:02:15,427 --> 02:02:20,099
FEARFUL THAT THEY'RE ON THE 

3573
02:02:20,099 --> 02:02:20,666
VERGE OF LOSING HARD FOUGHT 

3574
02:02:20,666 --> 02:02:23,936
RIGHTS THAT HAS NEVER BEEN MORE 

3575
02:02:23,936 --> 02:02:26,171
IMPORTANT THAN IT IS TODAY 

3576
02:02:26,171 --> 02:02:28,607
FRANKLY, AS A MEMBER OF THE 

3577
02:02:28,607 --> 02:02:30,342
SUPREME COURT BAR AND AS A 

3578
02:02:30,342 --> 02:02:32,344
UNITED STATES SENATOR I FEEL 

3579
02:02:32,344 --> 02:02:33,279
IT'S NEVER BEEN MORE AT RISK. 

3580
02:02:33,279 --> 02:02:39,418
THANK YOU.     

3581
02:02:39,418 --> 02:02:41,954
. 

3582
02:02:41,954 --> 02:02:43,889
>> HOW RIDICULOUS IT IS SO SAY 

3583
02:02:43,889 --> 02:02:46,492
THAT WE DON'T HAVE RECORDS THAT 

3584
02:02:46,492 --> 02:02:48,260
IT TAKES TO DETERMINE THIS 

3585
02:02:48,260 --> 02:02:51,096
PERSON'S QUALIFIED TO BE ON THE 

3586
02:02:51,096 --> 02:02:52,031
SUPREME COURT WHEN ALL THE 

3587
02:02:52,031 --> 02:02:55,000
DOCUMENTS WE HAVE  ADD UP TO 

3588
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:55,600
MORE THAN WE HAVE HAD FOR THE 

3589
02:02:55,600 --> 02:03:00,906
LAST 5 SUPREME COURT NOMINEES.  

3590
02:03:00,906 --> 02:03:02,942
HOW DID WE MAKE THOSE DECISIONS 

3591
02:03:02,942 --> 02:03:04,977
FOR THOSE OTHER 5? 

3592
02:03:04,977 --> 02:03:06,945
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, IF I COULD 

3593
02:03:06,945 --> 02:03:08,547
RESPOND TO THAT POINT, YOU'RE 

3594
02:03:08,547 --> 02:03:10,382
NOT GIVING THE WHOLE PICTURE 

3595
02:03:10,382 --> 02:03:11,116
SURE, 90% OF THE DOCUMENTS WE 

3596
02:03:11,116 --> 02:03:13,386
HAVEN'T SEEN. 

3597
02:03:13,386 --> 02:03:14,820
>> AND I'LL BE GLAD TO RESPOND 

3598
02:03:14,820 --> 02:03:15,086
TO THAT. 

3599
02:03:15,086 --> 02:03:19,992
>> YOU WOULDN'T HIRE AN INTERN 

3600
02:03:19,992 --> 02:03:23,028
WITH ONLY 90% OF THEIR RESUME. 

3601
02:03:23,028 --> 02:03:25,297
>> SENATOR -- 

3602
02:03:25,297 --> 02:03:26,364
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN, 

3603
02:03:26,364 --> 02:03:28,000
JUDGE KAVANAUGH WELCOME TO YOU 

3604
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,002
AND YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS. 

3605
02:03:30,002 --> 02:03:32,705
I'M AMAZED AT THE POKER FACES 

3606
02:03:32,705 --> 02:03:34,306
I'VE SEEN ON THE FRONT ROW 

3607
02:03:34,306 --> 02:03:36,408
DURING ALL THIS UNLIKE ANYTHING 

3608
02:03:36,408 --> 02:03:36,875
I'VE SEEN BEFORE IN A 

3609
02:03:36,875 --> 02:03:40,012
CONFIRMATION HEARING.    

3610
02:03:40,012 --> 02:03:42,781
IN MY VIEW IT'S NOT BECAUSE  

3611
02:03:42,781 --> 02:03:44,416
YOUR OPPONENTS DON'T KNOW 

3612
02:03:44,416 --> 02:03:45,417
ENOUGH ABOUT YOU, IT'S BECAUSE 

3613
02:03:45,417 --> 02:03:48,387
THEY DO KNOW ALL THEY NEED TO 

3614
02:03:48,387 --> 02:03:50,422
KNOW APPARENT TO OPPOSE YOUR 

3615
02:03:50,422 --> 02:03:51,123
NOMINATION.    

3616
02:03:51,123 --> 02:03:54,826
AND EVEN BEFORE YOU'VE HAD A 

3617
02:03:54,826 --> 02:03:55,861
CHANCE TO ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS 

3618
02:03:55,861 --> 02:03:56,495
INCLUDING THEIR QUESTIONS MANY 

3619
02:03:56,495 --> 02:03:57,896
OF THEM HAVE MADE UP THEIR 

3620
02:03:57,896 --> 02:03:59,931
MINDS, BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

3621
02:03:59,931 --> 02:04:03,302
HAVE NOT  BEEN INTRODUCED TO 

3622
02:04:03,302 --> 02:04:03,902
YOU BEFORE. 

3623
02:04:03,902 --> 02:04:08,307
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITYFOR ALL 

3624
02:04:08,307 --> 02:04:10,075
OF US TO ENGAGE IN A QUESTION 

3625
02:04:10,075 --> 02:04:12,177
AND ANSWER FORMAT THAT WILL 

3626
02:04:12,177 --> 02:04:13,545
HOPEFULLY ALUMINUM NATURE HOW 

3627
02:04:13,545 --> 02:04:15,914
IMPORTANT IT IS TO HAVE JUDGES 

3628
02:04:15,914 --> 02:04:18,250
TEETHERED TO TEXT OF THE LAWS 

3629
02:04:18,250 --> 02:04:19,484
PASSED BY CONGRESS, SIGNED BY 

3630
02:04:19,484 --> 02:04:20,085
THE PRESIDENT AS WELL AS THE 

3631
02:04:20,085 --> 02:04:20,652
CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED 

3632
02:04:20,652 --> 02:04:25,958
STATES.       

3633
02:04:25,958 --> 02:04:27,892
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 

3634
02:04:27,892 --> 02:04:29,160
UNDERTAKES FEW MORE IMPORTANT 

3635
02:04:29,160 --> 02:04:31,363
TASKS THAN THE ONE BEFORE US 

3636
02:04:31,363 --> 02:04:32,364
TODAY. 

3637
02:04:32,364 --> 02:04:33,332
LAST YEAR THECOMMITTEE 

3638
02:04:33,332 --> 02:04:36,235
CONSIDERED AND ADVANCED THE 

3639
02:04:36,235 --> 02:04:39,405
NOMINATION OF JUSTICE NEIL 

3640
02:04:39,405 --> 02:04:39,872
GORSUCH IS ONE OF THE 

3641
02:04:39,872 --> 02:04:43,007
OUTSTANDING JUDICIAL NOMINEES 

3642
02:04:43,007 --> 02:04:45,644
WOULD PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

3643
02:04:45,644 --> 02:04:46,879
[INAUDIBLE] 

3644
02:04:46,879 --> 02:04:47,446
BUT 26 JUDGES TO THE APPEAL 

3645
02:04:47,446 --> 02:04:49,614
LATE COURTS ACROSS THE NATION, 

3646
02:04:49,614 --> 02:04:53,185
THIS INCLUDES 3 OUTSTANDING 

3647
02:04:53,185 --> 02:04:55,420
TEANS TO THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 

3648
02:04:55,420 --> 02:04:57,289
COURT OF APPEALS. 

3649
02:04:57,289 --> 02:04:57,889
HISTORICALLY THE CONFIRMATION 

3650
02:04:57,889 --> 02:05:00,459
OF JUDGES TO THE HIGHEST COURTS 

3651
02:05:00,459 --> 02:05:03,862
WAS SOMEWHAT ROUTINE, ROUTINE. 

3652
02:05:03,862 --> 02:05:06,632
JUSTICE GORSUCH WAS UNANIMOUSLY 

3653
02:05:06,632 --> 02:05:08,567
CONFIRMED BY A SIMPLE VOICE 

3654
02:05:08,567 --> 02:05:12,137
VOTE TO THE COURT OF APPEALS. 

3655
02:05:12,137 --> 02:05:12,671
NOTONE SENATOR WHO VOTED 

3656
02:05:12,671 --> 02:05:15,307
AGAINST JUSTICE KENNEDY WHO 

3657
02:05:15,307 --> 02:05:16,408
BOTH YOU CLERKED FOR AND WHO 

3658
02:05:16,408 --> 02:05:20,312
YOU WILL SUCCEED ON THE COURT, 

3659
02:05:20,312 --> 02:05:24,316
NOT ONE SENATOR VOTED AGAINST 

3660
02:05:24,316 --> 02:05:27,286
JUSTICE SCALIA'S CONFIRMATION 

3661
02:05:27,286 --> 02:05:28,553
WHO YOU'VE CALLED A ROLE MODEL 

3662
02:05:28,553 --> 02:05:32,524
AND HERO THAT WAS BEFORE THEY 

3663
02:05:32,524 --> 02:05:33,091
WERE VIEWED AS POLICYMAKERS 

3664
02:05:33,091 --> 02:05:37,062
RATHER THAN FAIR AND NEUTRAL 

3665
02:05:37,062 --> 02:05:38,630
INTERA TERSE. 

3666
02:05:38,630 --> 02:05:39,431
TODAYI SUGGEST IT IS A 

3667
02:05:39,431 --> 02:05:40,232
WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY TO 

3668
02:05:40,232 --> 02:05:44,303
REEXAMINE THE PROPER ROLE FOR 

3669
02:05:44,303 --> 02:05:44,970
JUDGES UNDER OUR CONSTITUTION 

3670
02:05:44,970 --> 02:05:45,904
AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 

3671
02:05:45,904 --> 02:05:48,307
LEGISLATORS AND JUDGES.     

3672
02:05:48,307 --> 02:05:50,175
AS JUSTICE GORSUCH WROTE BEFORE 

3673
02:05:50,175 --> 02:05:55,581
HE JOINED THE SUPREME COURT 

3674
02:05:55,581 --> 02:05:56,215
UPHOLDING AND ENFORCING THIS 

3675
02:05:56,215 --> 02:05:57,449
INSIDE WAS THE GREAT PROJECT OF 

3676
02:05:57,449 --> 02:06:02,221
THE LATE JUSTICE SCALIA'S 

3677
02:06:02,221 --> 02:06:02,454
CAREER. 

3678
02:06:02,454 --> 02:06:03,855
HEWOULD ALWAYS REMIND US THAT 

3679
02:06:03,855 --> 02:06:05,457
LEGISLATORS MAY APPEAL TO THEIR 

3680
02:06:05,457 --> 02:06:06,692
OWN MORAL CONVICTIONS AND 

3681
02:06:06,692 --> 02:06:09,728
CLAIMS ABOUT SOCIAL UTILITY.    

3682
02:06:09,728 --> 02:06:12,264
BUT JUDGES INSTEAD   CON STRIVE 

3683
02:06:12,264 --> 02:06:14,299
TO APPLY THE LAW AS IT IS 

3684
02:06:14,299 --> 02:06:16,035
LOOKING TO THE TEXT, STRUCTURE 

3685
02:06:16,035 --> 02:06:16,602
AND HISTORY, NOT TO DECIDE 

3686
02:06:16,602 --> 02:06:20,839
CASES BASED ON THEIR OWN MORAL 

3687
02:06:20,839 --> 02:06:22,775
CONVICTIONS OR THE POLICY 

3688
02:06:22,775 --> 02:06:23,108
CONSEQUENCES. 

3689
02:06:23,108 --> 02:06:25,010
SO THIS HEARINGIS A  

3690
02:06:25,010 --> 02:06:26,912
OUTSTANDING WAY  TO REMIND THE 

3691
02:06:26,912 --> 02:06:28,547
AMERICAN PEOPLE THE PROPER ROLE 

3692
02:06:28,547 --> 02:06:29,014
OF JUDGES UNDER OUR 

3693
02:06:29,014 --> 02:06:31,183
CONSTITUTION.     

3694
02:06:31,183 --> 02:06:35,220
OUR CONSTITUTION PROVIDES FOR A 

3695
02:06:35,220 --> 02:06:35,820
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF LIMITED 

3696
02:06:35,820 --> 02:06:39,325
AND DELEGATED POWERS WITH THE 

3697
02:06:39,325 --> 02:06:41,526
BILL OF RIGHTS TO FURTHER 

3698
02:06:41,526 --> 02:06:44,830
PROTECT OUR INDIVIDUAL 

3699
02:06:44,830 --> 02:06:45,331
LIBERTIES. 

3700
02:06:45,331 --> 02:06:45,631
[INAUDIBLE]

3701
02:06:45,631 --> 02:06:48,233
AS YOUKNOW THE LEGISLATURE TO 

3702
02:06:48,233 --> 02:06:51,403
ENACT LAWS, THE EXECUTIVE 

3703
02:06:51,403 --> 02:06:52,137
REPORTS THEM AND THE JUDICIAL 

3704
02:06:52,137 --> 02:06:55,140
BRANCH TO SETTLE DISPUTES ABOUT 

3705
02:06:55,140 --> 02:06:56,374
THE MEANING OF THOSE LAWS AND 

3706
02:06:56,374 --> 02:06:59,010
THE CONSTITUTION. 

3707
02:06:59,010 --> 02:07:00,779
OF COURSE THELEGISLATURE CAN 

3708
02:07:00,779 --> 02:07:03,415
CHANGE THE LAWS BUT ONLY AN 

3709
02:07:03,415 --> 02:07:05,350
AMENDMENT CAN CHANGE THE 

3710
02:07:05,350 --> 02:07:08,287
CONSTITUTION FOR THIS REASON 

3711
02:07:08,287 --> 02:07:08,754
HAMILTON WROTE IN THE 

3712
02:07:08,754 --> 02:07:11,590
FEDERALIST PAPERS -- MR. 

3713
02:07:11,590 --> 02:07:12,190
CHAIRMAN, COULD I PAUSE THERE 

3714
02:07:12,190 --> 02:07:12,958
UNTIL THE ROOM IS CLEARED? 

3715
02:07:12,958 --> 02:07:15,560
>> YEAH. 

3716
02:07:15,560 --> 02:07:16,461
>> THANK YOU. 

3717
02:07:16,461 --> 02:07:17,095
FOR THIS REASONHAMILTON WROTE 

3718
02:07:17,095 --> 02:07:18,964
IN THE FEDERALIST PAPERS THAT 

3719
02:07:18,964 --> 02:07:21,332
THE JUDICIARY WILL ALWAYS BE 

3720
02:07:21,332 --> 02:07:23,969
THE LEAST DANGEROUS BRANCH 

3721
02:07:23,969 --> 02:07:27,306
BECAUSE AS HE FAMOUSLY WROTE 

3722
02:07:27,306 --> 02:07:28,574
JUDGES WOULD HAVE NEITHER FORCE 

3723
02:07:28,574 --> 02:07:32,311
NOR WILL BUT MERELY JUDGMENT. 

3724
02:07:32,311 --> 02:07:33,579
TODAY THE COMMITTEEIS GATHERED 

3725
02:07:33,579 --> 02:07:35,614
TO CONSIDER WHETHER JUDGE 

3726
02:07:35,614 --> 02:07:36,615
KAVANAUGH MR. HONOR THAT ROLE 

3727
02:07:36,615 --> 02:07:39,885
AND WHETHER PROPERLY EXERCISE 

3728
02:07:39,885 --> 02:07:44,256
THE MODEST AND HUMBLE POWER OF 

3729
02:07:44,256 --> 02:07:47,192
JUDGMENT ENTRUSTED TO HIM UNDER 

3730
02:07:47,192 --> 02:07:47,592
OUR CONSTITUTION. 

3731
02:07:47,592 --> 02:07:48,227
I'MCONFIDENT THE SENATE 

3732
02:07:48,227 --> 02:07:49,294
[INAUDIBLE] 

3733
02:07:49,294 --> 02:07:51,429
LAWS OF THIS GREAT NATION AND I 

3734
02:07:51,429 --> 02:07:52,264
LOOK FORWARD TO HIM SUCCEEDING 

3735
02:07:52,264 --> 02:07:53,632
JUSTICE KENNEDY.    

3736
02:07:53,632 --> 02:07:56,668
ONE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE 

3737
02:07:56,668 --> 02:07:59,671
I'VE BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH JUDGE 

3738
02:07:59,671 --> 02:08:00,305
KAVANAUGH FOR ABOUT 18 YEARS 

3739
02:08:00,305 --> 02:08:02,106
AND I CAN PERSONALLY ATTEST TO 

3740
02:08:02,106 --> 02:08:20,292
HIS SKILLS AS A LAWYER.       

3741
02:08:44,349 --> 02:08:44,883
. 

3742
02:08:44,883 --> 02:08:46,618
>>  MAY I PROCEED? 

3743
02:08:46,618 --> 02:08:46,884
>> YEAH. 

3744
02:08:46,884 --> 02:08:49,688
>> AS I WAS SAYING.       

3745
02:08:49,688 --> 02:08:51,422
WHEN I WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL OF 

3746
02:08:51,422 --> 02:08:54,993
TEXAS I HAD A CHANCE TO ARGUE A 

3747
02:08:54,993 --> 02:08:56,328
COUPLE OF CASES IN FRONT OF THE 

3748
02:08:56,328 --> 02:08:57,329
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. 

3749
02:08:57,329 --> 02:09:00,332
ONE CASE JUDGE KAVANAUGH HELPED 

3750
02:09:00,332 --> 02:09:03,101
ME PREPARE FOR WAS ONE 

3751
02:09:03,101 --> 02:09:03,635
INVOLVING THE QUESTION OF 

3752
02:09:03,635 --> 02:09:06,171
SCHOOL PRAYER AT A HIGH SCHOOL 

3753
02:09:06,171 --> 02:09:07,906
FOOTBALL GAME.    

3754
02:09:07,906 --> 02:09:09,474
AFTER THAT I WAS PLEASE TODAY 

3755
02:09:09,474 --> 02:09:12,243
INTRODUCE JUDGE KAVANAUGH TO 

3756
02:09:12,243 --> 02:09:14,246
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WHEN 

3757
02:09:14,246 --> 02:09:16,348
PRESIDENT BUSH FIRST NOMINATED 

3758
02:09:16,348 --> 02:09:19,985
HIM TO BE A JUDGE ON THE D.C. 

3759
02:09:19,985 --> 02:09:20,252
CIRCUIT. 

3760
02:09:20,252 --> 02:09:20,819
WHATI SAID BACK THEN STILL 

3761
02:09:20,819 --> 02:09:24,189
STANDS THE TEST OF TIME TODAY. 

3762
02:09:24,189 --> 02:09:25,357
HE HASA ACADEMIC AND 

3763
02:09:25,357 --> 02:09:27,525
PROFESSIONAL RECORD OF SERVICE. 

3764
02:09:27,525 --> 02:09:31,930
MANY WILLCITE HIS EDUCATION, 

3765
02:09:31,930 --> 02:09:32,497
CLERKSHIPS, HIS EXPERIENCE 

3766
02:09:32,497 --> 02:09:33,966
WORKING FOR THE EXECUTIVE 

3767
02:09:33,966 --> 02:09:36,034
BRANCH, BUT I THINK ONE OF THE 

3768
02:09:36,034 --> 02:09:36,668
MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS TO ME IS 

3769
02:09:36,668 --> 02:09:38,804
HE'S ALREADY  EXERCISED  

3770
02:09:38,804 --> 02:09:41,773
EXCELLENT JUDGMENT  IN MARRY 

3771
02:09:41,773 --> 02:09:43,108
AGO TEXAN.     

3772
02:09:43,108 --> 02:09:46,145
SO I KNOW HE'S A GOOD JUDGE.    

3773
02:09:46,145 --> 02:09:48,780
IN FACT, JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS ONE 

3774
02:09:48,780 --> 02:09:50,482
OF THE MOST RESPECTED JUDGES IN 

3775
02:09:50,482 --> 02:09:52,751
THE COUNTRY.     

3776
02:09:52,751 --> 02:09:56,455
I AM DISAPPOINTED  THAT DESPITE 

3777
02:09:56,455 --> 02:09:57,656
HIS QUALIFICATIONS AND 

3778
02:09:57,656 --> 02:09:59,057
OUTSTANDING RECORDS SO MANY OF 

3779
02:09:59,057 --> 02:10:01,827
OUR COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE ISLE 

3780
02:10:01,827 --> 02:10:02,460
HAVE ANNOUNCED THEIR OPPOSITION 

3781
02:10:02,460 --> 02:10:29,421
EVEN BEFORE HE WAS NOMINATED.   

3782
02:10:29,421 --> 02:10:32,357
SOME HAVE CLAIMED THAT YOU'VE 

3783
02:10:32,357 --> 02:10:33,425
TESTIFIED FALSELY WE'VE ALREADY 

3784
02:10:33,425 --> 02:10:36,161
HEARD THAT ALLUDED TO BEFORE 

3785
02:10:36,161 --> 02:10:37,529
THE COMMITTEE WHEN YOU WERE 

3786
02:10:37,529 --> 02:10:39,531
SERVING OUR COUNTRY IN THE BUSH 

3787
02:10:39,531 --> 02:10:40,332
WHITE HOUSE I HOPE YOU'LL HAVE 

3788
02:10:40,332 --> 02:10:42,000

WIPING AWAY PREVIOUS DECISIONS  

3837
02:12:18,196 --> 02:12:20,999
SINGLE HANDEDLY NOT EVEN WITH 

3838
02:12:20,999 --> 02:12:23,000
THE HELP OF OTHER MEMBERS OF

02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:24,436
THE COURT IS JUST PLAIN 

3840
02:12:24,436 --> 02:12:25,604
RIDICULOUS, AND WE LOOK FORWARD

BEING HERE TODAY. 

3847
02:12:43,155 --> 02:12:44,990
THIS IS A DIFFERENTHEARING.     

3848
02:12:44,990 --> 02:12:47,592
IT'S DIFFERENT IN WHAT'S 

3849
02:12:47,592 --> 02:12:48,226
HAPPENED IN THIS ROOM JUST THIS 

3850
02:12:48,226 --> 02:12:50,195
MORNING.     

3851
02:12:50,195 --> 02:12:54,132
WHAT WE'VE HEARD  IS THE NOISE 

3852
02:12:54,132 --> 02:12:55,434
OF DEMOCRACY, THIS IS WHAT 

3853
02:12:55,434 --> 02:12:56,434
HAPPENS IN A FREE COUNTRY WHEN 

3854
02:12:56,434 --> 02:12:59,104
PEOPLE CAN STAND UP AND SPEAK.  

3855
02:12:59,104 --> 02:13:03,475
AND NOT BE  JAILED, IMPRISONED, 

3856
02:13:03,475 --> 02:13:05,009
TORTURED OR KILLED BECAUSE OF 

3857
02:13:05,009 --> 02:13:06,278
IT.    

3858
02:13:06,278 --> 02:13:09,414
IT IS NOT MOB RULE.      

3859
02:13:09,414 --> 02:13:11,582
THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN IT 

3860
02:13:11,582 --> 02:13:13,784
IS UNCOMFORTABLE, I'M SURE IT 

3861
02:13:13,784 --> 02:13:15,520
WAS FOR YOUR CHILDREN, I HOPE 

3862
02:13:15,520 --> 02:13:17,222
YOU CAN EXPLAIN THIS TO THEM AT 

3863
02:13:17,222 --> 02:13:19,323
SOME POINT, BUT IT DOES 

3864
02:13:19,323 --> 02:13:20,558
REPRESENT WHAT WE ARE ABOUT IN 

3865
02:13:20,558 --> 02:13:21,426
THIS DEMOCRACY. 

3866
02:13:21,426 --> 02:13:23,695
WHY IS THISHAPPENING FOR THE 

3867
02:13:23,695 --> 02:13:24,295
FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF 

3868
02:13:24,295 --> 02:13:24,596
COMMITTEE? 

3869
02:13:24,596 --> 02:13:26,731
ITHINK WE NEED TO BE HONEST 

3870
02:13:26,731 --> 02:13:27,365
ABOUT WHY IT'S HAPPENING.    

3871
02:13:27,365 --> 02:13:30,969
I THINK IT'S THE SAME REASON 

3872
02:13:30,969 --> 02:13:32,504
WHY WHEN I GO HOME TO ILLINOIS 

3873
02:13:32,504 --> 02:13:33,305
AFTER BEING IN THIS PUBLIC 

3874
02:13:33,305 --> 02:13:36,308
SERVICE JOB  FOR OVER 30 YEARS, 

3875
02:13:36,308 --> 02:13:39,311
I HEAR A QUESTION THAT I'VE 

3876
02:13:39,311 --> 02:13:42,314
NEVER EVER HEARD BEFORE 

3877
02:13:42,314 --> 02:13:44,182
REPEATEDLY AS PEOPLE PULL ME 

3878
02:13:44,182 --> 02:13:44,715
OFF TO THE SIDE AND SAY, 

3879
02:13:44,715 --> 02:13:47,519
SENATOR,  ARE WE GOING TO BE 

3880
02:13:47,519 --> 02:13:48,419
ALL RIGHT? 

3881
02:13:48,419 --> 02:13:50,489
ISAMERICA GOING TO BE ALL 

3882
02:13:50,489 --> 02:13:51,990
RIGHT?    

3883
02:13:51,990 --> 02:13:54,191
THEY'RE GENUINELY CONCERNED 

3884
02:13:54,191 --> 02:13:55,761
ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS 

3885
02:13:55,761 --> 02:13:56,328
COUNTRY 

3886
02:13:56,328 --> 02:14:00,232
YOU COME TO THISMOMENT IN 

3887
02:14:00,232 --> 02:14:00,832
HISTORY IN A RARE SITUATION. 

3888
02:14:00,832 --> 02:14:03,334
YOU ARE ASPIRING TOTHE MOST 

3889
02:14:03,334 --> 02:14:06,538
DECISIVE VOTE ON THE SUPREME 

3890
02:14:06,538 --> 02:14:08,306
COURT ON CRITICAL ISSUES, 

3891
02:14:08,306 --> 02:14:09,407
JUSTICE KENNEDY DID THAT FOR 12 

3892
02:14:09,407 --> 02:14:09,640
YEARS. 

3893
02:14:09,640 --> 02:14:10,174
AND YOU'RE CALLEDTO THAT 

3894
02:14:10,174 --> 02:14:12,043
RESPONSIBILITY.     

3895
02:14:12,043 --> 02:14:14,045
AND WE REALIZE THE GRAVITY OF 

3896
02:14:14,045 --> 02:14:15,280
THAT HAVE OPPORTUNITY AND THAT 

3897
02:14:15,280 --> 02:14:20,052
RESPONSIBILITY.      

3898
02:14:20,052 --> 02:14:20,585
SECONDLY, OF COURSE, YOUR 

3899
02:14:20,585 --> 02:14:23,889
RECORD AND THE STATEMENTS OF 

3900
02:14:23,889 --> 02:14:25,657
OTHERS  SUGGESTS THERE'S REAL 

3901
02:14:25,657 --> 02:14:27,725
GENUINE CONCERN ABOUT CHANGING 

3902
02:14:27,725 --> 02:14:31,163
LIFE AND DEATH  VALUES IN THIS 

3903
02:14:31,163 --> 02:14:31,796
COUNTRY BECAUSE YOU SEE THINGS 

3904
02:14:31,796 --> 02:14:33,899
DIFFERENTLY.      

3905
02:14:33,899 --> 02:14:35,733
WE'VE HEARD THAT OVER AND OVER 

3906
02:14:35,733 --> 02:14:36,334
AGAIN. 

3907
02:14:36,334 --> 02:14:37,736
AND I -- I THINKYOU MUST 

3908
02:14:37,736 --> 02:14:42,474
UNDERSTAND  THE DEPTH OF 

3909
02:14:42,474 --> 02:14:43,107
FEELING ABOUT THAT [INAUDIBLE]. 

3910
02:14:43,107 --> 02:14:45,076
AND THIRD, TRY ASTHEY MIGHT I'M 

3911
02:14:45,076 --> 02:14:46,811
AFRAID THE MAJORITY JUST CAN'T 

3912
02:14:46,811 --> 02:14:48,313
GET BEYOND THE FACT THAT THERE 

3913
02:14:48,313 --> 02:14:51,383
ARE PARTS OF YOUR PUBLIC LIFE 

3914
02:14:51,383 --> 02:14:52,050
THAT THEY WANT TO CONCEAL. 

3915
02:14:52,050 --> 02:14:54,085
THEY DON'T WANTAMERICA TO SEE 

3916
02:14:54,085 --> 02:14:56,021
THEM. 

3917
02:14:56,021 --> 02:14:56,655
I THINKTHAT'S A SERIOUS MISTAKE 

3918
02:14:56,655 --> 02:14:57,922
AND MAKE A SUGGESTION AT THE 

3919
02:14:57,922 --> 02:15:00,391
END OF MY REMARKS, BUT OVER AND 

3920
02:15:00,391 --> 02:15:03,428
ABOVE ALL OF THOSE THINGS IS 

3921
02:15:03,428 --> 02:15:10,168
THIS: YOU ARE THE NOMINEE  OF 

3922
02:15:10,168 --> 02:15:12,704
PRESIDENT DONALD JOHN TRUMP, 

3923
02:15:12,704 --> 02:15:14,439
THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO'S SHOWN 

3924
02:15:14,439 --> 02:15:16,174
US CONSISTENTLY -- HE HAS SAID 

3925
02:15:16,174 --> 02:15:19,411
AND DONE THINGS AS PRESIDENT  

3926
02:15:19,411 --> 02:15:20,312
WHICH WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE 

3927
02:15:20,312 --> 02:15:24,316
IN OUR HISTORY.     

3928
02:15:24,316 --> 02:15:27,219
HE IS DISMISSED THE HEAD OF THE 

3929
02:15:27,219 --> 02:15:27,853
FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION 

3930
02:15:27,853 --> 02:15:29,788
WHEN HE WOULDN'T BEND TO HIS 

3931
02:15:29,788 --> 02:15:31,889
WILL HE THREATENS AND HARASSES 

3932
02:15:31,889 --> 02:15:34,859
HIS OWN ATTORNEY GENERALLY 

3933
02:15:34,859 --> 02:15:38,263
ALMOST ON A DAILY BASIS, AND I 

3934
02:15:38,263 --> 02:15:38,863
DIDN'T VOTE FOR JEFF SESSIONS 

3935
02:15:38,863 --> 02:15:39,864
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU THERE 

3936
02:15:39,864 --> 02:15:43,368
SHOULD BE SOME RESPECT AT LEAST 

3937
02:15:43,368 --> 02:15:43,968
FOR THE OFFICE HE SERVED IN. 

3938
02:15:43,968 --> 02:15:45,303
AND IT'S THATPRESIDENT THAT'S 

3939
02:15:45,303 --> 02:15:48,206
DECIDED YOU ARE HIS MAN, YOU'RE 

3940
02:15:48,206 --> 02:15:50,609
THE PERSON HE WANTS ON THE 

3941
02:15:50,609 --> 02:15:51,176
SUPREME COURT, YOU ARE HIS 

3942
02:15:51,176 --> 02:15:51,576
PERSONAL CHOICE. 

3943
02:15:51,576 --> 02:15:53,044
SO AREPEOPLE NERVOUS ABOUT 

3944
02:15:53,044 --> 02:15:54,079
THIS? 

3945
02:15:54,079 --> 02:15:55,380
ARETHEY CONCERNED ABOUT IT? 

3946
02:15:55,380 --> 02:15:56,314
OFCOURSE THEY ARE. 

3947
02:15:56,314 --> 02:15:57,448
I'M SURE THEREWILL BE A SHOWER 

3948
02:15:57,448 --> 02:15:59,851
OF TWEETS SOME TIME LATER IN 

3949
02:15:59,851 --> 02:16:00,485
THE DAY HARASSING PEOPLE IN THE 

3950
02:16:00,485 --> 02:16:01,919
CABINET, PEOPLE IN THE WHITE 

3951
02:16:01,919 --> 02:16:04,422
HOUSE, MAYBE EVEN DISMISSING 

3952
02:16:04,422 --> 02:16:06,758
THEM, AND MAYBE EVEN GO AFTER

BE MY GUEST.

3955
02:16:08,659 --> 02:16:09,961
BUT THE POINT I'M GETTING TO IS 

3956
02:16:09,961 --> 02:16:11,128
IF YOU WONDER WHY THIS REACTION 

3957
02:16:11,128 --> 02:16:12,196
IS TAKING PLACE BECAUSE OF 

3958
02:16:12,196 --> 02:16:12,730
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS 

3959
02:16:12,730 --> 02:16:14,432
COUNTRY,    THERE ARE MANY OF 

3960
02:16:14,432 --> 02:16:15,933

02:16:15,933 --> 02:16:17,502
OF THIS COUNTRY.    

3962
02:16:17,502 --> 02:16:18,737
AND THE FUTURE OF DEMOCRACY.    

3963
02:16:18,737 --> 02:16:20,572
AND YOU ARE ASKING FOR A 

3964
02:16:20,572 --> 02:16:22,707
LIFETIME APPOINTMENT TO THE 

3965
02:16:22,707 --> 02:16:24,375
HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND WHERE

YOU'RE GOING TO TELL US THAT

4045
02:18:47,885 --> 02:18:50,254

AN OPEN MIND, FOLLOW THE LAW 

4049
02:18:56,227 --> 02:19:00,331
RATHER THAN MOVE THE LAW IN THE 

4050
02:19:00,331 --> 02:19:03,101
DIRECTION OF YOUR VIEWS. 

4051
02:19:03,101 --> 02:19:03,601
I'D LIKE TO TRUSTYOU.  

4052
02:19:03,601 --> 02:19:05,003
I WANTED TO TRUST YOU THE LAST

TIME YOU TESTIFIED BEFORE THIS

YOU WERE CONFIRMED TO THE D.C. 

4056
02:19:10,674 --> 02:19:12,677
CIRCUIT REPORTS SURFACED THAT 

4057
02:19:12,677 --> 02:19:14,445
CONTRADICTED YOUR SWORN 

4058
02:19:14,445 --> 02:19:15,447
TESTIMONY BEFORE THIS 

4059
02:19:15,447 --> 02:19:16,781

OFFICE THAT YOU WERE INVOLVED. 

4068
02:19:33,498 --> 02:19:34,799
FOR 12 YEARS YOU COULD HAVE 

4069
02:19:34,799 --> 02:19:36,901
APOLOGIZED AND CORRECTED THIS 

4070
02:19:36,901 --> 02:19:39,102
RECORD BUT YOU NEVER INSTEAD. 

4071
02:19:39,102 --> 02:19:40,605
INSTEAD YOU AND YOUR SUPPORTERS 

4072
02:19:40,605 --> 02:19:42,206
ARGUED WE SHOULD IGNORE THE 

4073
02:19:42,206 --> 02:19:44,776
SIMPLE SENTENCE WHICH YOU SPOKE 

4074
02:19:44,776 --> 02:19:45,943
AND SOMEHOW CON CLUE YOUR WORDS 

4075
02:19:45,943 --> 02:19:50,882
MEAN SOMETHING FAR DIFFERENT.   

4076
02:19:50,882 --> 02:19:54,586
YOU SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE 

4077
02:19:54,586 --> 02:19:55,019
FOR YOUR OWN WORDS. 

4078
02:19:55,019 --> 02:19:56,420
AFTER MY PERSONALEXPERIENCE  I 

4079
02:19:56,420 --> 02:19:57,789
START THESE HEARINGS WITH 

4080
02:19:57,789 --> 02:20:00,191

4086
02:20:08,866 --> 02:20:12,137
PROBLEM, I WON'T RETREAD THE

THERE'S A 35-MONTH BLACK HOLE 

4092
02:20:20,611 --> 02:20:21,212

02:21:56,874 --> 02:21:59,843
HOUSE  LED TO A CHANGE IN 

4146
02:21:59,843 --> 02:22:01,245
POSITION ON AN ISSUE WHICH WE 

4147
02:22:01,245 --> 02:22:04,315
HAVE TO ADDRESS  DIRECTLY.    

4148
02:22:04,315 --> 02:22:06,617
YOUR VIEWS ON EXECUTIVE POWER 

4149
02:22:06,617 --> 02:22:09,253
AND ACCOUNTABILITY HAVE CHANGED 

4150
02:22:09,253 --> 02:22:09,586
DRAMATICALLY. 

4151
02:22:09,586 --> 02:22:10,688
WHEN YOU WORKEDFOR SPECIAL 

4152
02:22:10,688 --> 02:22:13,090

AMERICAN HERO FOR INVESTIGATING

PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON, AND YOU 

4156
02:22:19,263 --> 02:22:21,565
PERSONALLY URGED HIM TO BE 

4157
02:22:21,565 --> 02:22:24,102
AGGRESSIVE CONFRONTATIONAL AND 

4158
02:22:24,102 --> 02:22:26,571
EVEN GRAPHIC IN HIS QUESTIONS.  

4159
02:22:26,571 --> 02:22:28,039
WE'VE SEEN YOUR MEMO ON THAT 

4160
02:22:28,039 --> 02:22:28,239
ONE. 

4161
02:22:28,239 --> 02:22:30,642
A FEW YEARS LATER AFTERWORKING 

4162
02:22:30,642 --> 02:22:31,242
IN THE REPUBLICAN WHITE HOUSE 

4163
02:22:31,242 --> 02:22:32,243
YOU TOTALLY REVERSED YOUR 

4164
02:22:32,243 --> 02:22:33,144
POSITION AND ARGUED THE 

4165
02:22:33,144 --> 02:22:33,778
PRESIDENT SHOULD BE ABOVE THE 

4166
02:22:33,778 --> 02:22:48,326
LAW.      

4167
02:22:48,326 --> 02:22:49,227
. 

4168
02:22:49,227 --> 02:22:51,195
>> AT THIS MOVEMENT IN OUR 

4169
02:22:51,195 --> 02:22:52,196
NATION'S HISTORY WITH FORCES 

4170
02:22:52,196 --> 02:22:53,831
THREATENING OUR DEMOCRACY WITH 

4171
02:22:53,831 --> 02:22:56,667
THE CAMPAIGN AND ADMINISTRATION 

4172
02:22:56,667 --> 02:22:58,102
OF THIS PRESIDENT UNDER FEDERAL 

4173
02:22:58,102 --> 02:22:59,537
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION, WE NEED 

4174
02:22:59,537 --> 02:23:00,504
A DIRECT CREDIBLE ANSWER FROM 

4175
02:23:00,504 --> 02:23:02,807
YOU.     

4176
02:23:02,807 --> 02:23:03,474
IS THIS PRESIDENT OR ANY 

4177
02:23:03,474 --> 02:23:06,310
PRESIDENT ABOVE THE LAW?      

4178
02:23:06,310 --> 02:23:09,347
EQUALLY IMPORTANT CAN THIS 

4179
02:23:09,347 --> 02:23:10,648
PRESIDENT IGNORE THE 

4180
02:23:10,648 --> 02:23:11,282
CONSTITUTION IN THE EXERCISE OF 

4181
02:23:11,282 --> 02:23:41,145
HIS AUTHORITY.      

4182
02:23:41,446 --> 02:23:42,280
WHEN THE PRESIDENT DEEMED THE 

4183
02:23:42,280 --> 02:23:43,047
STATUTE UNCONSTITUTIONAL EVEN 

4184
02:23:43,047 --> 02:23:44,282
WHEN THE COURT WOULD HOLD THE 

4185
02:23:44,282 --> 02:23:44,882
STATUE OR CONSTITUTION. 

4186
02:23:44,882 --> 02:23:48,152
THIS FLIES IN THE FACE OF OUR 

4187
02:23:48,152 --> 02:23:48,753
SEPARATION OF POWERS. 

4188
02:23:48,753 --> 02:23:52,623
IS LICENSED TO THIS PRESIDENT, 

4189
02:23:52,623 --> 02:23:53,658
DONALD TRUMP, OR ANY PRESIDENT 

4190
02:23:53,658 --> 02:23:54,559
WHO CHOOSES TO IGNORE THE 

4191
02:23:54,559 --> 02:23:55,092
CONSTITUTION, TO ASSERT 

4192
02:23:55,092 --> 02:24:00,164
AUTHORITY FAR BEYOND THAT 

4193
02:24:00,164 --> 02:24:00,965
ENVISIONED BY OUR FOUNDING -- 

4194
02:24:00,965 --> 02:24:01,398
FOUNDING FATHERS. 

4195
02:24:01,398 --> 02:24:03,000
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE 

4196
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:03,500
WATCHING CAREFULLY. 

4197
02:24:03,500 --> 02:24:06,170
I MIGHT MAKE A SUGGESTION TO 

4198
02:24:06,170 --> 02:24:11,209
YOU TODAY. 

4199
02:24:11,209 --> 02:24:12,010
IF YOU BELIEVE YOUR PUBLIC 

4200
02:24:12,010 --> 02:24:13,144
RECORD IS ONE YOU CAN STAND 

4201
02:24:13,144 --> 02:24:15,346
BEHIND AND DEFEND, I HOPE AT 

4202
02:24:15,346 --> 02:24:16,781
THE END OF THIS YOU WILL ASK 

4203
02:24:16,781 --> 02:24:20,551
THIS COMMITTEE TO SUSPEND UNTIL 

4204
02:24:20,551 --> 02:24:21,753
WE ARE GIVEN ALL THE DOCUMENTS, 

4205
02:24:21,753 --> 02:24:23,454
UNTIL WE HAVE THE TIME TO 

4206
02:24:23,454 --> 02:24:26,257
REVIEW THEM. AND THEN WE RESUME 

4207
02:24:26,257 --> 02:24:26,758
THIS HEARING. 

4208
02:24:26,758 --> 02:24:29,193
WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU IS 

4209
02:24:29,193 --> 02:24:30,428
BASICALLY THIS, IF YOU WILL 

4210
02:24:30,428 --> 02:24:31,229
TRUST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THEY 

4211
02:24:31,229 --> 02:24:32,330
WILL TRUST YOU. 

4212
02:24:32,330 --> 02:24:34,799
BUT IF YOU'RE EFFORT TODAY 

4213
02:24:34,799 --> 02:24:36,334
CONTINUES TO CONCEAL AND HIGH 

4214
02:24:36,334 --> 02:24:40,972
DOCUMENTS, IT RAISES A SUSPICION

4215
02:24:40,972 --> 02:24:42,273
. I WILL CLOSE MR. CHAIRMAN. 

4216
02:24:42,273 --> 02:24:43,574
I KNOW YOU ARE ANXIOUS. 

4217
02:24:43,574 --> 02:24:45,643
WHEN I WAS A PRACTICING LAWYER, 

4218
02:24:45,643 --> 02:24:50,314
A LONG TIME AGO IN TRIALS, AND 

4219
02:24:50,314 --> 02:24:51,315
THE OTHER SIDE EITHER DESTROYED 

4220
02:24:51,315 --> 02:24:54,585
OR CONCEALED EVIDENCE, I KNEW 

4221
02:24:54,585 --> 02:24:55,987
THAT I WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO 

4222
02:24:55,987 --> 02:24:57,021
HAVE A CONVINCING ARGUMENT TO 

4223
02:24:57,021 --> 02:24:59,056
CLOSE THAT CASE. 

4224
02:24:59,056 --> 02:24:59,657
WHAT WERE THEY HIDING? 

4225
02:24:59,657 --> 02:25:07,298
WHY WON'T THEY LET YOU SEE THE 

4226
02:25:07,298 --> 02:25:08,633
TAPE ON THAT TRAIN OR THE 

4227
02:25:08,633 --> 02:25:09,233
DOCUMENTS THEY CAN'T FIND? 

4228
02:25:09,233 --> 02:25:10,535
YOU KNOW THE PRESUMPTION NOW IS 

4229
02:25:10,535 --> 02:25:11,869
AGAINST YOU BECAUSE OF ALL THE 

4230
02:25:11,869 --> 02:25:12,637
DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN HELD 

4231
02:25:12,637 --> 02:25:13,037
BACK. 

4232
02:25:13,037 --> 02:25:14,071
FOR THE SAKE OF THIS NATION, 

4233
02:25:14,071 --> 02:25:15,273
FOR THE SANCTITY OF THE 

4234
02:25:15,273 --> 02:25:16,207
CONSTITUTION WE BOTH HONOR, 

4235
02:25:16,207 --> 02:25:19,844
STEP UP, ASK THIS GATHERING TO 

4236
02:25:19,844 --> 02:25:24,315
SUSPEND UNTIL ALL THE DOCUMENTS 

4237
02:25:24,315 --> 02:25:25,650
OF YOUR PUBLIC CAREER ARE THERE 

4238
02:25:25,650 --> 02:25:26,851
FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO SEE. 

4239
02:25:26,851 --> 02:25:27,485
THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 

4240
02:25:27,485 --> 02:25:28,286
>> SENATOR LEAHY. 

4241
02:25:28,286 --> 02:25:33,157
>> THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN AND 

4242
02:25:33,157 --> 02:25:35,026
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.  

4243
02:25:35,026 --> 02:25:36,727
I AM GOING TO START BY SAYING 

4244
02:25:36,727 --> 02:25:39,897
THAT, THE FACT THAT THERE IS SO 

4245
02:25:39,897 --> 02:25:42,466
MUCH ANGST OVER A SINGLE NOMINEE

4246
02:25:42,466 --> 02:25:45,503
, A SINGLE JUDICIAL NOMINEE 

4247
02:25:45,503 --> 02:25:46,938
TELLS YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED 

4248
02:25:46,938 --> 02:25:51,843
TO KNOW ABOUT WHY IT IS THAT WE 

4249
02:25:51,843 --> 02:25:53,311
NEED JUDGES ARE NOW MORE THAN 

4250
02:25:53,311 --> 02:25:58,349
EVER WHO ARE WILLING TO READ 

4251
02:25:58,349 --> 02:25:59,383
THE LAW AND INTERPRET BASED ON 

4252
02:25:59,383 --> 02:26:00,785
WHAT THE LAW SAYS RATHER THAN 

4253
02:26:00,785 --> 02:26:02,019
ON THE BASIS OF SOMETHING ELSE. 

4254
02:26:02,019 --> 02:26:05,690
IT ALSO TELLS YOU MORE THAN 

4255
02:26:05,690 --> 02:26:06,891
ANYTHING ELSE YOU COULD NEED TO 

4256
02:26:06,891 --> 02:26:08,125
KNOW ABOUT THE NEED TO RESTORE 

4257
02:26:08,125 --> 02:26:09,593
A DISCUSSION OF CIVICS IN THIS 

4258
02:26:09,593 --> 02:26:13,397
COUNTRY. 

4259
02:26:13,397 --> 02:26:14,432
TO RESTORE A DISCUSSION ABOUT 

4260
02:26:14,432 --> 02:26:15,233
FEDERALISM AND SEPARATION OF 

4261
02:26:15,233 --> 02:26:15,466
POWERS. 

4262
02:26:15,466 --> 02:26:16,067
ABOUT WHERE POWER IS 

4263
02:26:16,067 --> 02:26:16,868
CONCENTRATED AND WHERE IT 

4264
02:26:16,868 --> 02:26:18,502
SHOULD NOT BE AND WHAT THE RULE 

4265
02:26:18,502 --> 02:26:19,570
OF EACH BRANCH OF THE FEDERAL 

4266
02:26:19,570 --> 02:26:20,938
GOVERNMENT IS AND IS NOT. 

4267
02:26:20,938 --> 02:26:29,947
MANY OF THE COMMENTS, MANY 

4268
02:26:29,947 --> 02:26:30,948
OUTBURSTS WE HAVE HAD TODAY 

4269
02:26:30,948 --> 02:26:32,250
SUGGEST WE NEED TO RETURN TO 

4270
02:26:32,250 --> 02:26:32,984
SOME OF THOSE FUNDAMENTAL 

4271
02:26:32,984 --> 02:26:33,284
PRINCIPLES. 

4272
02:26:33,284 --> 02:26:34,518
I DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU ARE A 

4273
02:26:34,518 --> 02:26:35,319
LIBERAL DEMOCRAT OR 

4274
02:26:35,319 --> 02:26:35,886
CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN OR 

4275
02:26:35,886 --> 02:26:38,822
SOMETHING IN BETWEEN, THESE 

4276
02:26:38,822 --> 02:26:39,222
PRINCIPLES APPLY. 

4277
02:26:39,222 --> 02:26:40,224
THEY ARE PRINCIPLES TO WHICH WE 

4278
02:26:40,224 --> 02:26:41,726
HAVE SWORN AN OATH AND THEY ARE 

4279
02:26:41,726 --> 02:26:43,060
PRINCIPLES WE WOULD DO WELL TO 

4280
02:26:43,060 --> 02:26:44,428
RESTORE AND FOCUS ON ONCE 

4281
02:26:44,428 --> 02:26:45,196
AGAIN. 

4282
02:26:45,196 --> 02:26:47,331
IF EVER WE WERE TO RETURN TO AN 

4283
02:26:47,331 --> 02:26:52,770
ERROR OF FOR SO -- -- WE WILL 

4284
02:26:52,770 --> 02:26:53,604
RETURN -- CIVILITY, WE WOULD 

4285
02:26:53,604 --> 02:27:03,347
RETURN ON THE BASIS -- A NUMBER 

4286
02:27:03,347 --> 02:27:04,448
OF MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE 

4287
02:27:04,448 --> 02:27:05,283
WILL ASK YOU QUESTIONS, 

4288
02:27:05,283 --> 02:27:06,384
QUESTIONS ABOUT CASES THAT YOU 

4289
02:27:06,384 --> 02:27:07,418
HAVE HANDLED AS A LAWYER, CASES 

4290
02:27:07,418 --> 02:27:08,920
THAT YOU HAVE DECIDED AS A 

4291
02:27:08,920 --> 02:27:09,654
JUDGE, ABOUT YOUR RECORD, ABOUT 

4292
02:27:09,654 --> 02:27:10,121
YOUR QUALIFICATIONS. 

4293
02:27:10,121 --> 02:27:11,855
ON THAT POINT ABOUT YOUR RECORD 

4294
02:27:11,855 --> 02:27:16,794
AND QUALIFICATIONS, THE 

4295
02:27:16,794 --> 02:27:17,995
SUGGESTION THAT YOU MISLED THIS 

4296
02:27:17,995 --> 02:27:19,130
COMMITTEE AT ANY POINT IN YOUR 

4297
02:27:19,130 --> 02:27:21,065
PREVIOUS HEARINGS IS ABSURD. 

4298
02:27:21,065 --> 02:27:22,066
AND THE ABSURDITY OF THAT 

4299
02:27:22,066 --> 02:27:23,301
SUGGESTION WILL BE BORN OUT IN 

4300
02:27:23,301 --> 02:27:23,701
THE COMING DAYS. 

4301
02:27:23,701 --> 02:27:29,040
I AM CERTAIN OF THAT. 

4302
02:27:29,040 --> 02:27:30,341
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WILL 

4303
02:27:30,341 --> 02:27:32,009
BE ASKED OF YOU WILL IN FACT BE 

4304
02:27:32,009 --> 02:27:35,212
FAIR AND OTHERS WILL BE UNFAIR, 

4305
02:27:35,212 --> 02:27:36,547
AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR 

4306
02:27:36,547 --> 02:27:37,782
US TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AT THE 

4307
02:27:37,782 --> 02:27:38,015
OUTSET. 

4308
02:27:38,015 --> 02:27:40,284
WHEN YOU LOOK BACK IN HISTORY, 

4309
02:27:40,284 --> 02:27:41,351
ANSWERING THESE KINDS OF 

4310
02:27:41,351 --> 02:27:48,326
QUESTIONS, THIS IS SORT OF HOW 

4311
02:27:48,326 --> 02:27:51,929
THEY -- THE PRACTICE OF HOLDING 

4312
02:27:51,929 --> 02:27:53,030
THE SERIES BEGAN, SO SENATORS 

4313
02:27:53,030 --> 02:27:53,965
COULD ASK NOMINEES HOW THEY 

4314
02:27:53,965 --> 02:27:55,933
MIGHT GO, HOW THEY MIGHT RULE 

4315
02:27:55,933 --> 02:28:00,538
IN PARTICULAR CASES. 

4316
02:28:00,538 --> 02:28:01,539
BUT THIS DID NOT ALWAYS HAPPEN. 

4317
02:28:01,539 --> 02:28:02,673
IN FACT, IT WASN'T UNTIL 1916 

4318
02:28:02,673 --> 02:28:04,875
THAT THIS EVEN STARTED. 

4319
02:28:04,875 --> 02:28:07,945
YOU SEE, THERE HAVE BEEN 113 

4320
02:28:07,945 --> 02:28:11,082
JUSTICES CONFIRMED TO THE 

4321
02:28:11,082 --> 02:28:12,216
SUPREME COURT SO FAR. 

4322
02:28:12,216 --> 02:28:13,017
THE FIRST 66 WERE CONFIRMED 

4323
02:28:13,017 --> 02:28:16,320
WITHOUT EVEN HOLDING A HEARING. 

4324
02:28:16,320 --> 02:28:17,688
THE IDEA OF A HEARING IS 

4325
02:28:17,688 --> 02:28:20,324
RELATIVELY NEW, ABOUT 102 YEARS 

4326
02:28:20,324 --> 02:28:25,229
OLD. 

4327
02:28:25,229 --> 02:28:26,664
WE WENT FOR BETWEEN 125 AND 130 

4328
02:28:26,664 --> 02:28:27,498
YEARS UNDER THE CONSTITUTIONAL 

4329
02:28:27,498 --> 02:28:28,299
REPUBLIC WITHOUT EVER HAVING A 

4330
02:28:28,299 --> 02:28:28,699
HEARING. 

4331
02:28:28,699 --> 02:28:29,400
REGARDLESS, WE STARTED HAVING 

4332
02:28:29,400 --> 02:28:32,203
HEARINGS JUST OVER A CENTURY 

4333
02:28:32,203 --> 02:28:33,638
AGO. 

4334
02:28:33,638 --> 02:28:34,639
THE VERY FIRST SUPREME COURT 

4335
02:28:34,639 --> 02:28:35,706
CONFIRMATION HEARING OCCURRED 

4336
02:28:35,706 --> 02:28:40,311
IN 1916 WITH JUSTICE LOUIS 

4337
02:28:40,311 --> 02:28:41,545
BRANDEIS. 

4338
02:28:41,545 --> 02:28:43,280
AFTER HE WAS NOMINATED TO THE 

4339
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:46,117
COURT, CALLED FOR A HEARING. IF 

4340
02:28:46,117 --> 02:28:50,187
WE ARE HONEST WITH OURSELVES, 

4341
02:28:50,187 --> 02:28:51,422
IF WE ARE HONEST ABOUT HISTORY, 

4342
02:28:51,422 --> 02:28:53,257
I THINK A LOT OF US MAYBE HAD 

4343
02:28:53,257 --> 02:28:55,059
TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT HE 

4344
02:28:55,059 --> 02:28:59,163
WAS JEWISH. BUT SENATORS ALSO 

4345
02:28:59,163 --> 02:29:00,331
WANTED TO DETERMINE WHETHER HE 

4346
02:29:00,331 --> 02:29:01,399
WOULD USE HIS SEAT ON THE 

4347
02:29:01,399 --> 02:29:04,035
SUPREME COURT TO ADVOCATE FOR 

4348
02:29:04,035 --> 02:29:05,770
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HE HAD 

4349
02:29:05,770 --> 02:29:07,872
ADVOCATED FOR AS A PRIVATE 

4350
02:29:07,872 --> 02:29:08,272
CITIZEN. 

4351
02:29:08,272 --> 02:29:11,108
AS A PUBLIC INTEREST ATTORNEY. 

4352
02:29:11,108 --> 02:29:12,676
THEY WANTED TO KNOW HOW HE 

4353
02:29:12,676 --> 02:29:15,379
MIGHT VOTE IN PARTICULAR CASES. 

4354
02:29:15,379 --> 02:29:18,416
THEY DID NOT ASK JUSTICE 

4355
02:29:18,416 --> 02:29:20,317
BRANDEIS TO TESTIFY 

4356
02:29:20,317 --> 02:29:23,821
SIGNIFICANTLY. 

4357
02:29:23,821 --> 02:29:25,355
BUT THEY DID IN FACT ASK SOME 

4358
02:29:25,355 --> 02:29:26,090
OUTSIDE WITNESSES WHAT THEY 

4359
02:29:26,090 --> 02:29:30,227
THOUGHT ABOUT HIS NOMINATION. 

4360
02:29:30,227 --> 02:29:31,062
THE NEXT IMPORTANT MOMENT ONE 

4361
02:29:31,062 --> 02:29:32,530
COULD ARGUE OCCURRED IN 1939 

4362
02:29:32,530 --> 02:29:37,535
WHEN FELIX FRANKFURTER BECAME 

4363
02:29:37,535 --> 02:29:38,469
THE FIRST NOMINEE TO HIMSELF 

4364
02:29:38,469 --> 02:29:39,169
TESTIFY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. 

4365
02:29:39,169 --> 02:29:46,143
AT THE TIME, HE WAS 

4366
02:29:46,143 --> 02:29:46,877
CONTROVERSIAL IN PART BECAUSE 

4367
02:29:46,877 --> 02:29:48,079
HE WAS BORN OVERSEAS, BUT 

4368
02:29:48,079 --> 02:29:49,080
SENATORS ALSO WORRIED THAT HE 

4369
02:29:49,080 --> 02:29:50,982
WAS A RADICAL BASED ON HIS 

4370
02:29:50,982 --> 02:29:58,655
DEFENSE OF ANARCHISTS IN COURT. 

4371
02:29:58,655 --> 02:29:59,490
SO AGAIN, SENATORS WANTED 

4372
02:29:59,490 --> 02:30:00,291
ASSURANCES ABOUT HOW HE MIGHT 

4373
02:30:00,291 --> 02:30:03,661
RULE IN PARTICULAR CASES AND 

4374
02:30:03,661 --> 02:30:04,962
WHAT RESULTS HE MIGHT REACH IN 

4375
02:30:04,962 --> 02:30:10,368
A PARTICULAR TYPE OF CASE. 

4376
02:30:10,368 --> 02:30:11,068
HE, HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANTLY 

4377
02:30:11,068 --> 02:30:11,869
DECLINED TO ENGAGE WITH 

4378
02:30:11,869 --> 02:30:14,905
SENATORS ON THOSE TOPICS, AND 

4379
02:30:14,905 --> 02:30:16,207
INSISTED HIS PUBLIC RECORD 

4380
02:30:16,207 --> 02:30:25,049
SPOKE FOR ITSELF. 

4381
02:30:25,049 --> 02:30:25,750
THE NOMINATION OF JUSTICE 

4382
02:30:25,750 --> 02:30:26,784
STEWART IN 1959 WITH ANOTHER 

4383
02:30:26,784 --> 02:30:27,184
TURNING POINT. 

4384
02:30:27,184 --> 02:30:27,985
SENATORS SEEKING TO RESIST 

4385
02:30:27,985 --> 02:30:33,190
BROWN VERSUS BOARD OF EDUCATION,

4386
02:30:33,190 --> 02:30:34,625
THEY WANTED TO GRILL HIM ON HIS 

4387
02:30:34,625 --> 02:30:35,326
VIEWS ON INTEGRATION. 

4388
02:30:35,326 --> 02:30:36,360
OTHERS WANTED TO GRILL HIM 

4389
02:30:36,360 --> 02:30:37,361
ABOUT HIS VIEWS ON NATIONAL 

4390
02:30:37,361 --> 02:30:37,627
SECURITY. 

4391
02:30:37,627 --> 02:30:38,896
SO SENATORS TURNED UP THE HEAT 

4392
02:30:38,896 --> 02:30:40,364
A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THAT 

4393
02:30:40,364 --> 02:30:46,003
HEARING. LIKE FRANKFURTER 

4394
02:30:46,003 --> 02:30:47,004
BEFORE HIM, JUSTICE STEWART DID 

4395
02:30:47,004 --> 02:30:47,838
NOT PROVIDE SUBSTANTIVE ANSWERS 

4396
02:30:47,838 --> 02:30:50,441
TO THEIR QUESTIONS. WHEN THEY 

4397
02:30:50,441 --> 02:30:51,475
WANTED TO KNOW HOW YOU MIGHT 

4398
02:30:51,475 --> 02:30:52,676
RULE IN PARTICULAR CASES, HE 

4399
02:30:52,676 --> 02:30:53,176
APPROPRIATELY DECLINED. 

4400
02:30:53,176 --> 02:30:55,579
JUST AS HIS PREDECESSORS HAD. 

4401
02:30:55,579 --> 02:31:00,784
28 YEARS LATER, AFTER JUSTICE 

4402
02:31:00,784 --> 02:31:02,286
STEWART CAME THROUGH THIS 

4403
02:31:02,286 --> 02:31:04,355
COMMITTEE, THE SENATE CONSIDERED

4404
02:31:04,355 --> 02:31:05,189
ROBERT BORK. 

4405
02:31:05,189 --> 02:31:08,325
THIS WAS ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT 

4406
02:31:08,325 --> 02:31:11,195
TURNING POINT. IN MY VIEW IT 

4407
02:31:11,195 --> 02:31:12,096
REMAINS SOMETHING OF A ROCK-

4408
02:31:12,096 --> 02:31:13,230
BOTTOM MOMENT FOR THE SENATE 

4409
02:31:13,230 --> 02:31:14,564
AND FOR THE SENATE JUDICIARY 

4410
02:31:14,564 --> 02:31:15,466
COMMITTEE. 

4411
02:31:15,466 --> 02:31:23,340
WITHOUT GETTING INTO ANY OF THE 

4412
02:31:23,340 --> 02:31:24,775
GORY DETAILS HERE, I THINK IT 

4413
02:31:24,775 --> 02:31:25,809
IS SUFFICE TO SAY THAT SENATOR 

4414
02:31:25,809 --> 02:31:27,211
TED KENNEDY AND JUDGE BORK DID 

4415
02:31:27,211 --> 02:31:28,779
NOT AGREE ON CERTAIN MATTERS OF 

4416
02:31:28,779 --> 02:31:30,648
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. 

4417
02:31:30,648 --> 02:31:32,449
AND THE RESPONSE BY KENNEDY WAS 

4418
02:31:32,449 --> 02:31:36,754
TO SAVAGE, UNFAIRLY IN MY 

4419
02:31:36,754 --> 02:31:39,423
OPINION, THE RESULTS THAT JUDGE 

4420
02:31:39,423 --> 02:31:40,824
BORK WOULD REACH IF CONFIRMED 

4421
02:31:40,824 --> 02:31:51,202
TO THE SUPREME COURT. 

4422
02:31:51,202 --> 02:31:52,236
HISTORY SHOWS THAT OVER THE 

4423
02:31:52,236 --> 02:31:53,637
BETTER PART OF A CENTURY THE 

4424
02:31:53,637 --> 02:31:54,137
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HAS 

4425
02:31:54,137 --> 02:31:54,771
GRADUALLY CREATED SOMETHING OF 

4426
02:31:54,771 --> 02:31:56,240
A NEW NORM, A NORM IN WHICH 

4427
02:31:56,240 --> 02:31:56,907
MEMBERS DEMANDED NOMINEES SPEAK 

4428
02:31:56,907 --> 02:31:59,977
ABOUT SPECIFIC CASES.

4429
02:32:02,947 --> 02:32:11,388
NOMINEES FOR THE MOST PART HAVE 

4430
02:32:11,388 --> 02:32:11,988
GRACEFULLY RESISTED TRADING 

4431
02:32:11,988 --> 02:32:12,589
CONFIRMATION IN EXCHANGE FOR 

4432
02:32:12,589 --> 02:32:13,757
PROMISES ABOUT HOW THEY MIGHT 

4433
02:32:13,757 --> 02:32:15,125
VOTE IN PARTICULAR CASES 

4434
02:32:15,125 --> 02:32:16,360
BROUGHT BEFORE THEM. 

4435
02:32:16,360 --> 02:32:17,228
TO GIVE TWO FAMOUS EXAMPLES, 

4436
02:32:17,228 --> 02:32:20,331
JUSTICE SCALIA REFUSED TO SAY 

4437
02:32:20,331 --> 02:32:24,001
WHETHER MARBURY VERSUS MADISON 

4438
02:32:24,001 --> 02:32:25,236
WAS SETTLED LAW ON THE GROUND 

4439
02:32:25,236 --> 02:32:26,403
THAT IT COULD COME BEFORE HIM, 

4440
02:32:26,403 --> 02:32:29,073
AND SURE ENOUGH LAST TERM IN 

4441
02:32:29,073 --> 02:32:30,174
ORTIZ VERSUS UNITED STATES, THE 

4442
02:32:30,174 --> 02:32:31,008
SUPREME COURT CONSIDERED A CASE 

4443
02:32:31,008 --> 02:32:32,876
INDICATING THE SCOPE OF THAT. 

4444
02:32:32,876 --> 02:32:35,112
LIKEWISE, JUSTICE RUTH BADER 

4445
02:32:35,112 --> 02:32:42,152
GINSBURG MADE THE SOWS CALLED 

4446
02:32:42,152 --> 02:32:42,753
GINSBERG STANDARD. 

4447
02:32:42,753 --> 02:32:43,687
NO PREVIOUS, NO FORECAST, NO 

4448
02:32:43,687 --> 02:32:44,188
HINT. 

4449
02:32:44,188 --> 02:32:49,293
EVERY CURRENT MEMBER OF THE 

4450
02:32:49,293 --> 02:32:50,427
SUPREME COURT HAS ADHERED TO A 

4451
02:32:50,427 --> 02:32:50,928
SIMILAR PRINCIPLE. 

4452
02:32:50,928 --> 02:32:52,663
WHAT WE MIGHT CALL THE GINSBERG 

4453
02:32:52,663 --> 02:32:53,397
STANDARD. 

4454
02:32:53,397 --> 02:32:55,399
EVEN THOUGH NOMINEES HAVE NOT 

4455
02:32:55,399 --> 02:32:58,802
CAVED TO THE PRESSURE, I STILL 

4456
02:32:58,802 --> 02:33:01,872
BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SOME 

4457
02:33:01,872 --> 02:33:03,406
ASPECTS OF THE SENATE APPROACH 

4458
02:33:03,406 --> 02:33:05,108
HERE THAT MIGHT DO A DISSERVICE 

4459
02:33:05,108 --> 02:33:08,145
TO THE COUNTRY AND MIGHT BE 

4460
02:33:08,145 --> 02:33:09,380
FROWNED UPON BY FUTURE 

4461
02:33:09,380 --> 02:33:10,814
HISTORIANS. 

4462
02:33:10,814 --> 02:33:12,216
IF SENATORS REPEATEDLY ASK 

4463
02:33:12,216 --> 02:33:14,451
NOMINEES ABOUT OUTCOMES, THEN 

4464
02:33:14,451 --> 02:33:15,286
THE PUBLIC WILL BE MORE 

4465
02:33:15,286 --> 02:33:16,687
ENTITLED OR AT LEAST MORE 

4466
02:33:16,687 --> 02:33:17,721
INCLINED TO THINK THAT JUDGES 

4467
02:33:17,721 --> 02:33:20,491
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE OUTCOME 

4468
02:33:20,491 --> 02:33:20,757
MIGHT'VE. 

4469
02:33:20,757 --> 02:33:22,459
THAT THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE 

4470
02:33:22,459 --> 02:33:24,862
THEIR WHOLE APPROACH TO 

4471
02:33:24,862 --> 02:33:25,129
JUDGING. 

4472
02:33:25,129 --> 02:33:26,163
THAT THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE 

4473
02:33:26,163 --> 02:33:30,934
WHAT JUDGING IS ABOUT. 

4474
02:33:30,934 --> 02:33:31,869
BUT THIS, OF COURSE, UNDERMINES 

4475
02:33:31,869 --> 02:33:32,970
THE LEGITIMACY OF THE COURTS 

4476
02:33:32,970 --> 02:33:33,270
THEMSELVES. 

4477
02:33:33,270 --> 02:33:34,371
THE VERY LEGITIMACY OF THE 

4478
02:33:34,371 --> 02:33:36,807
TRIBUNAL THAT YOU HAVE BEEN 

4479
02:33:36,807 --> 02:33:38,008
NOMINATED BY THE PRESIDENT TO 

4480
02:33:38,008 --> 02:33:38,342
SERVE ON. 

4481
02:33:38,342 --> 02:33:40,211
OVERTIME, NO FREE PEOPLE WOULD 

4482
02:33:40,211 --> 02:33:43,814
ACCEPT A JUDICIARY THAT SIMPLY 

4483
02:33:43,814 --> 02:33:44,515
IMPOSES ITS OWN POLICY 

4484
02:33:44,515 --> 02:33:47,451
PREFERENCES ON THE COUNTRY 

4485
02:33:47,451 --> 02:33:48,619
ABSENT FIDELITY TO LEGAL 

4486
02:33:48,619 --> 02:33:52,055
PRINCIPLE. 

4487
02:33:52,055 --> 02:33:53,490
THERE IS A BETTER WAY FOR THE 

4488
02:33:53,490 --> 02:33:56,927
SENATE TO APPROACH ITS WORK. 

4489
02:33:56,927 --> 02:33:57,961
THIS PROCESS, IN MY OPINION, 

4490
02:33:57,961 --> 02:34:00,231
SHOULD BE ABOUT YOUR 

4491
02:34:00,231 --> 02:34:02,533
QUALIFICATIONS, ABOUT YOUR 

4492
02:34:02,533 --> 02:34:03,233
CHARACTER, AND PERHAPS MOST 

4493
02:34:03,233 --> 02:34:04,335
IMPORTANTLY, ABOUT YOUR 

4494
02:34:04,335 --> 02:34:06,670
APPROACH TO JUDGING, YOUR OWN 

4495
02:34:06,670 --> 02:34:07,671
VIEW ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE 

4496
02:34:07,671 --> 02:34:08,272
FEDERAL JUDICIARY. 

4497
02:34:08,272 --> 02:34:11,542
IT SHOULD NOT BE ABOUT RESULTS 

4498
02:34:11,542 --> 02:34:16,814
IN A SELECT NUMBER OF CASES. 

4499
02:34:16,814 --> 02:34:20,184
YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY EXCEPTIONALLY 

4500
02:34:20,184 --> 02:34:23,320
WELL-QUALIFIED, EVEN YOUR 

4501
02:34:23,320 --> 02:34:23,920
STAUNCHEST CRITICS WOULD NOT 

4502
02:34:23,920 --> 02:34:25,089
CLAIM OTHERWISE. 

4503
02:34:25,089 --> 02:34:26,890
YOUR ACADEMIC PEDIGREE, YOUR 

4504
02:34:26,890 --> 02:34:27,524
EXPERIENCE AS A PRACTICING 

4505
02:34:27,524 --> 02:34:28,658
LAWYER, YOUR EXPERIENCE IN 

4506
02:34:28,658 --> 02:34:29,860
GOVERNMENT AND YOUR 12 YEARS 

4507
02:34:29,860 --> 02:34:31,395
EXPERIENCE SITTING ON WHAT MANY 

4508
02:34:31,395 --> 02:34:36,667
REFER TO AS THE SECOND HIGHEST 

4509
02:34:36,667 --> 02:34:37,768
COURT IN THE LAND, U.S. COURT 

4510
02:34:37,768 --> 02:34:43,941
OF APPEALS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT.

4511
02:34:43,941 --> 02:34:44,742
YOU WERE INDEPENDENT. 

4512
02:34:44,742 --> 02:34:45,976
YOU HAVE WRITTEN THAT "SOME OF 

4513
02:34:45,976 --> 02:34:46,977
THE GREATEST MOMENTS IN 

4514
02:34:46,977 --> 02:34:47,678
AMERICAN JUDICIAL HISTORY HAVE 

4515
02:34:47,678 --> 02:34:49,380
BEEN WHEN JUDGES STOOD UP TO 

4516
02:34:49,380 --> 02:34:55,619
THE OTHER BRANCHES. WE ARE NOT 

4517
02:34:55,619 --> 02:34:56,620
COWED AND ENFORCED THE LAW." 

4518
02:34:56,620 --> 02:34:57,654
YOU HAVE SAID THAT JUDGES 

4519
02:34:57,654 --> 02:34:58,488
CANNOT BE BUFFALOED INFLUENCED 

4520
02:34:58,488 --> 02:35:04,561
OR PRESSURED INTO WORRIED -- 

4521
02:35:04,561 --> 02:35:05,396
WORRYING TOO MUCH ABOUT 

4522
02:35:05,396 --> 02:35:06,030
TRANSIENT POPULARITY WHEN WE 

4523
02:35:06,030 --> 02:35:07,631
ARE TRYING TO DECIDE A CASE AND 

4524
02:35:07,631 --> 02:35:08,665
THAT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT 

4525
02:35:08,665 --> 02:35:10,167
DUTIES OF A JUDGE IS TO STAND 

4526
02:35:10,167 --> 02:35:11,268
UP FOR THE UNPOPULAR PARTY WHO 

4527
02:35:11,268 --> 02:35:12,302
HAS THE CORRECT POSITION. 

4528
02:35:12,302 --> 02:35:13,704
AND YOU HAVE LIVED UP TO YOUR 

4529
02:35:13,704 --> 02:35:15,104
WORDS DURING YOUR TIME ON THE 

4530
02:35:15,104 --> 02:35:19,076
BENCH. 

4531
02:35:19,076 --> 02:35:20,010
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT YOU SERVED 

4532
02:35:20,010 --> 02:35:20,878
IN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION. 

4533
02:35:20,878 --> 02:35:22,712
AND YET, WHEN YOU BECAME A JUDGE

4534
02:35:22,712 --> 02:35:27,618
, IN ONLY TWO YEARS YOU RULED 

4535
02:35:27,618 --> 02:35:28,418
AGAINST THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION 

4536
02:35:28,418 --> 02:35:32,723
A TOTAL OF EIGHT TIMES. FOR YOU 

4537
02:35:32,723 --> 02:35:33,824
IT SIMPLY DOESN'T MATTER WHO 

4538
02:35:33,824 --> 02:35:34,458
THE PARTIES ARE. 

4539
02:35:34,458 --> 02:35:35,659
IT SIMPLY DOESN'T MATTER THAT 

4540
02:35:35,659 --> 02:35:37,461
YOU MAY HAVE WORKED FOR AN 

4541
02:35:37,461 --> 02:35:40,931
ADMINISTRATION BEFORE YOU 

4542
02:35:40,931 --> 02:35:41,565
BECAME A JUDGE. 

4543
02:35:41,565 --> 02:35:43,333
THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IS 

4544
02:35:43,333 --> 02:35:46,904
YOUR COMMITMENT TO CORRECTLY 

4545
02:35:46,904 --> 02:35:48,238
APPLYING THE LAW TO THE FACTS 

4546
02:35:48,238 --> 02:35:49,840
OF ANY PARTICULAR CASE. 

4547
02:35:49,840 --> 02:35:51,274
AS FAR AS YOUR APPROACH TO 

4548
02:35:51,274 --> 02:35:54,311
JUDGING, YOU HAVE APPROPRIATE 

4549
02:35:54,311 --> 02:36:02,052
RESPECT FOR PRECEDENT. 

4550
02:36:02,052 --> 02:36:03,053
YOU HAVE CO-AUTHORED AN 800 

4551
02:36:03,053 --> 02:36:03,887
PAGE BOOK ON PRECEDENT THAT 

4552
02:36:03,887 --> 02:36:04,788
AMONG OTHER THINGS EXPLAINS 

4553
02:36:04,788 --> 02:36:06,123
THAT A CHANGE IN A COURT 

4554
02:36:06,123 --> 02:36:07,291
MEMBERSHIP ALONE SHOULD NOT 

4555
02:36:07,291 --> 02:36:15,899
THROW FORMER DECISIONS OPEN TO 

4556
02:36:15,899 --> 02:36:16,700
RECONSIDERATION OR JUSTIFY 

4557
02:36:16,700 --> 02:36:17,100
THEIR REVERSAL. 

4558
02:36:17,100 --> 02:36:17,901
YOU'VE EXPLAINED THAT FOR 

4559
02:36:17,901 --> 02:36:18,735
PRECEDENT TO BE OVERRULED, IT 

4560
02:36:18,735 --> 02:36:20,204
MUST NOT BE JUST WRONG, BUT A 

4561
02:36:20,204 --> 02:36:21,238
CASE WITH SERIOUS PRACTICAL 

4562
02:36:21,238 --> 02:36:21,571
CONSEQUENCES. 

4563
02:36:21,571 --> 02:36:24,741
YOU VOTED TO OVERTURN CIRCUIT 

4564
02:36:24,741 --> 02:36:31,382
PRECEDENT ONLY FOUR TIMES 

4565
02:36:31,382 --> 02:36:32,716
DURING YOUR TIME ON THE D.C. 

4566
02:36:32,716 --> 02:36:33,817
CIRCUIT AND EACH OF THESE CASES 

4567
02:36:33,817 --> 02:36:34,551
INVOLVED A UNANIMOUS DECISION 

4568
02:36:34,551 --> 02:36:37,387
REACHED BY YOUR COLLEAGUES. 

4569
02:36:37,387 --> 02:36:38,788
YOU FOLLOWED PRECEDENT EVEN 

4570
02:36:38,788 --> 02:36:41,258
THOUGH YOU BELIEVED IT WAS 

4571
02:36:41,258 --> 02:36:41,791
ITSELF WRONGLY DECIDED. 

4572
02:36:41,791 --> 02:36:44,361
YOU DECIDE CASES BASED ON LEGAL 

4573
02:36:44,361 --> 02:36:48,999
MERITS, NOT BASED ON THE 

4574
02:36:48,999 --> 02:36:49,599
IDENTITY OF THE PARTIES. 

4575
02:36:49,599 --> 02:36:52,236
AND CERTAINLY NOT BASED ON ANY 

4576
02:36:52,236 --> 02:36:55,239
POLITICAL BELIEFS THAT YOU MAY 

4577
02:36:55,239 --> 02:36:56,306
HARBOR. WE'VE ALREADY HEARD 

4578
02:36:56,306 --> 02:37:00,210
THAT YOUR NOMINATION WILL 

4579
02:37:00,210 --> 02:37:11,522
SOMEHOW BE BAD. 

4580
02:37:11,522 --> 02:37:13,257
I HAVE A LAUNDRY LIST OF CASES 

4581
02:37:13,257 --> 02:37:14,258
IN WHICH YOU HAVE RULED FOR 

4582
02:37:14,258 --> 02:37:17,628
PEOPLE IN EACH OF THOSE GROUPS, 

4583
02:37:17,628 --> 02:37:18,662
BUT THERE IS A MORE FUNDAMENTAL 

4584
02:37:18,662 --> 02:37:19,863
POINT HERE THAT I THINK NEEDS 

4585
02:37:19,863 --> 02:37:21,231
TO BE MADE. 

4586
02:37:21,231 --> 02:37:22,532
THE JUDICIARY DECISIONS ARE 

4587
02:37:22,532 --> 02:37:28,138
LEGITIMATE. ONLY TO THE EXTENT 

4588
02:37:28,138 --> 02:37:29,273
THAT THEY ARE BASED ON SOUND 

4589
02:37:29,273 --> 02:37:32,009
LEGAL PRINCIPLE AND REASONING. 

4590
02:37:32,009 --> 02:37:33,243
AND RULING FOR A PREFERRED 

4591
02:37:33,243 --> 02:37:34,378
PARTY IS NOT ITSELF A SOUND 

4592
02:37:34,378 --> 02:37:34,745
LEGAL RENTABLE. 

4593
02:37:34,745 --> 02:37:36,179
IT IS QUITE CONTRARY. 

4594
02:37:36,179 --> 02:37:40,350
-- PRINCIPAL. 

4595
02:37:40,350 --> 02:37:45,855
IT IS QUITE CONTRARY. 

4596
02:37:45,855 --> 02:37:46,690
BACKFILLING REASONING TO REACH 

4597
02:37:46,690 --> 02:37:48,058
A PARTICULAR RESULT, A 

4598
02:37:48,058 --> 02:37:50,861
POLITICALLY ACCEPTABLE RESULT, 

4599
02:37:50,861 --> 02:37:51,962
IN A PARTICULAR CASE, NO MATTER 

4600
02:37:51,962 --> 02:37:53,430
HOW DESIRABLE THAT RESULT MIGHT 

4601
02:37:53,430 --> 02:38:01,705
BE IS NOT A LEGITIMATE IT -- 

4602
02:38:01,705 --> 02:38:02,506
LEGITIMATE MODE OF JUDICIAL 

4603
02:38:02,506 --> 02:38:03,507
DECISION-MAKING AND NO FREE 

4604
02:38:03,507 --> 02:38:04,308
PEOPLE PURPORTING TO HAVE AN 

4605
02:38:04,308 --> 02:38:04,942
INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY SHOULD 

4606
02:38:04,942 --> 02:38:06,576
EVER BE WILLING TO SETTLE FOR 

4607
02:38:06,576 --> 02:38:07,144
THAT. 

4608
02:38:07,144 --> 02:38:08,778
SO MY PLEA TO MY COLLEAGUES 

4609
02:38:08,778 --> 02:38:21,725
TODAY IS THAT WE ASK KAVANAUGH  

4610
02:38:21,725 --> 02:38:22,258
-- JUDGE KAVANAUGH HARD 

4611
02:38:22,258 --> 02:38:22,559
QUESTIONS. 

4612
02:38:22,559 --> 02:38:24,061
I BELIEVE WE ARE REQUIRED TO DO 

4613
02:38:24,061 --> 02:38:24,227
SO. 

4614
02:38:24,227 --> 02:38:25,362
THE SENATE IS NOT AND NEVER 

4615
02:38:25,362 --> 02:38:26,196
SHOULD BE A RUBBERSTAMP, 

4616
02:38:26,196 --> 02:38:27,297
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO 

4617
02:38:27,297 --> 02:38:27,964
ISSUING LIFETIME APPOINTMENTS.  

4618
02:38:27,964 --> 02:38:28,732
EVEN LIFETIME APPOINTMENTS ON 

4619
02:38:28,732 --> 02:38:30,133
THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND. 

4620
02:38:30,133 --> 02:38:31,368
BUT IF YOU DISAGREE WITH AN 

4621
02:38:31,368 --> 02:38:32,569
OPINION HE HAS WRITTEN, MAKE A 

4622
02:38:32,569 --> 02:38:34,771
LEGAL ARGUMENT AS TO THAT ISSUE.

4623
02:38:34,771 --> 02:38:36,439
EXPLAIN WHY YOU THINK IT IS 

4624
02:38:36,439 --> 02:38:38,474
WRONG. DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT THE 

4625
02:38:38,474 --> 02:38:41,778
RESULTS. 

4626
02:38:41,778 --> 02:38:43,914
AS IF THE RESULT ITSELF IS 

4627
02:38:43,914 --> 02:38:48,685
PROOF THAT HE IS WRONG WHEN YOU 

4628
02:38:48,685 --> 02:38:50,387
SEPARATE OUT THE RESULT FROM 

4629
02:38:50,387 --> 02:38:53,323
THE LEGAL ANALYSIS. 

4630
02:38:53,323 --> 02:38:54,324
FROM THE FACTS AND HOW THEY 

4631
02:38:54,324 --> 02:38:56,159
INTERACT WITH THE LAW IN THAT 

4632
02:38:56,159 --> 02:38:56,660
PARTICULAR CASE. 

4633
02:38:56,660 --> 02:38:58,428
AND DON'T ASK HIM TO MAKE 

4634
02:38:58,428 --> 02:39:03,367
PROMISES ABOUT OUTCOMES IN 

4635
02:39:03,367 --> 02:39:03,867
PARTICULAR CASES. 

4636
02:39:03,867 --> 02:39:05,102
IF IT IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR THE 

4637
02:39:05,102 --> 02:39:06,303
PRESIDENT TO IMPOSE A LITMUS 

4638
02:39:06,303 --> 02:39:09,506
TEST, IT IS SURELY UNACCEPTABLE 

4639
02:39:09,506 --> 02:39:12,209
FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE TO 

4640
02:39:12,209 --> 02:39:20,183
DO SO. 

4641
02:39:20,183 --> 02:39:21,284
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, I LOOK FORWARD 

4642
02:39:21,284 --> 02:39:22,219
TO YOUR TESTIMONY, AND I'M 

4643
02:39:22,219 --> 02:39:23,120
GRATEFUL TO YOU AND YOUR 

4644
02:39:23,120 --> 02:39:24,054
WILLINGNESS TO SERVE HER 

4645
02:39:24,054 --> 02:39:25,155
COUNTRY AND BE CONSIDERED FOR 

4646
02:39:25,155 --> 02:39:25,822
THIS IMPORTANT ROLE. 

4647
02:39:25,822 --> 02:39:26,322
>> SENATOR WHITEHOUSE. 

4648
02:39:26,322 --> 02:39:28,225
>>  THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 

4649
02:39:28,225 --> 02:39:33,463
WHEN IS PATTERN EVIDENCE OF 

4650
02:39:33,463 --> 02:39:36,099
BIAS? 

4651
02:39:36,099 --> 02:39:38,402
IN COURT, PATTERN IS EVIDENCE 

4652
02:39:38,402 --> 02:39:40,303
OF BIAS ALL THE TIME. 

4653
02:39:40,303 --> 02:39:43,807
EVIDENCE ON WHICH JURIES AND 

4654
02:39:43,807 --> 02:39:50,380
TRIAL JUDGES RELY TO SHOW 

4655
02:39:50,380 --> 02:39:51,014
DISCRIMINATORY INTENT, TO SHOW 

4656
02:39:51,014 --> 02:39:54,418
A COMMON SCHEME, TO SHOW BIAS. 

4657
02:39:54,418 --> 02:40:01,958
WHEN DOES A PATTERN PROVE BIAS? 

4658
02:40:01,958 --> 02:40:03,560
I WISH THIS WERE AN IDLE 

4659
02:40:03,560 --> 02:40:06,430
QUESTION? 

4660
02:40:06,430 --> 02:40:07,464
IT IS RELEVANT TO THE PATTERN 

4661
02:40:07,464 --> 02:40:10,434
OF THE ROBERTS COURT WHEN ITS 

4662
02:40:10,434 --> 02:40:15,639
REPUBLICAN MAJORITY GOES OFF ON 

4663
02:40:15,639 --> 02:40:16,707
PARTISAN EXCURSIONS THROUGH THE 

4664
02:40:16,707 --> 02:40:18,975
CIVIL LAW. 

4665
02:40:18,975 --> 02:40:20,343
THAT IS, WHEN ALL FIVE 

4666
02:40:20,343 --> 02:40:22,646
REPUBLICAN APPOINTEES, THE 

4667
02:40:22,646 --> 02:40:25,382
ROBERTS FIVE WE CAN CALL THEM, 

4668
02:40:25,382 --> 02:40:30,153
GO OFF TOGETHER AND NO 

4669
02:40:30,153 --> 02:40:32,322
DEMOCRATIC APPOINTEE JOINS THEM.

4670
02:40:32,322 --> 02:40:37,694
DOES THIS HAPPEN OFTEN? 

4671
02:40:37,694 --> 02:40:39,496
THE ROBERTS FIVE HAS GONE ON 

4672
02:40:39,496 --> 02:40:43,700
ALMOST 80 OF THESE PARTISAN 

4673
02:40:43,700 --> 02:40:44,868
EXCURSIONS SINCE ROBERTS BECAME 

4674
02:40:44,868 --> 02:40:48,638
CHIEF. THAT IS A LOT OF TIMES. 

4675
02:40:48,638 --> 02:40:52,209
AND THERE IS A FEATURE TO THESE 

4676
02:40:52,209 --> 02:40:53,710
80 CASES. 

4677
02:40:53,710 --> 02:40:55,077
THEY ALMOST ALL IMPLICATE 

4678
02:40:55,077 --> 02:41:00,917
INTERESTS IMPORTANT TO THE BIG 

4679
02:41:00,917 --> 02:41:02,219
FUNDERS AND INFLUENCERS OF THE 

4680
02:41:02,219 --> 02:41:03,887
REPUBLICAN PARTY. 

4681
02:41:03,887 --> 02:41:04,688
WHEN THE REPUBLICAN JUSTICES GO 

4682
02:41:04,688 --> 02:41:09,559
OFF ON THESE FIVE JUSTICE 

4683
02:41:09,559 --> 02:41:13,463

PARTISAN INTEREST INVOLVED 92% 

4686
02:41:16,366 --> 02:41:23,473
OF THE TIME. 

4687
02:41:23,473 --> 02:41:24,808
THE TINY HANDFUL OF THESE CASES 

4688
02:41:24,808 --> 02:41:25,609
THAT DON'T IMPLICATE AN 

4689
02:41:25,609 --> 02:41:26,610

4690
02:41:26,610 --> 02:41:27,744

4691
02:41:27,744 --> 02:41:30,013
WE CAN SET THEM ASIDE. 

4692
02:41:30,013 --> 02:41:37,587
LET'S LOOK AT THE 73 CASES THAT 

4693
02:41:37,587 --> 02:41:38,221
ALL IMPLICATE A MAJOR 

4694
02:41:38,221 --> 02:41:41,091
REPUBLICAN PARTY INTEREST. 

4695
02:41:41,091 --> 02:41:43,126
AGAIN, 73 IS A LOT OF CASES AT 

4696
02:41:43,126 --> 02:41:44,327
THE SUPREME COURT. 

4697
02:41:44,327 --> 02:41:47,597
IS THERE A PATTERN TO THESE 73 

4698
02:41:47,597 --> 02:41:49,866
CASES? 

4699
02:41:49,866 --> 02:41:54,671
YES THERE IS. 

4700
02:41:54,671 --> 02:41:55,572
EVERY TIME A BIG REPUBLICAN 

4701
02:41:55,572 --> 02:41:56,706

4709
02:42:23,733 --> 02:42:24,968
THUS, THE MAD SCRAMBLE OF BIG

4713
02:42:29,506 --> 02:42:34,678
REALLY BIG ONE SOMETIMES. 

4714
02:42:34,678 --> 02:42:35,679
I NOTE THAT WHEN THE ROBERTS 

4715
02:42:35,679 --> 02:42:39,815

4716
02:42:39,815 --> 02:42:40,450

4717
02:42:40,450 --> 02:42:41,518
ANYTHING BUT JUDICIALLY 

4718
02:42:41,518 --> 02:42:42,652

4738
02:43:35,805 --> 02:43:36,640
SO BADLY THAT REPUBLICANS

4740
02:43:39,476 --> 02:43:42,145

HELP REPUBLICANS KEEP MINORITY 

4751
02:44:03,400 --> 02:44:06,269

4767
02:44:47,944 --> 02:44:53,216
STANDS BESIDE LOCHNER ON THE 

4768
02:44:53,216 --> 02:44:53,817

4769
02:44:53,817 --> 02:44:56,319
WHAT ELSE DO BIG INFLUENCERS

WANT? 

4771
02:44:59,089 --> 02:45:00,156
TO GET OUT OF COURTROOMS. 

4772
02:45:00,156 --> 02:45:00,823
BIG INFLUENCERS HATE COURTROOMS 

4773
02:45:00,823 --> 02:45:03,093
BECAUSE THEY ARE LOBBYING AND 

4774
02:45:03,093 --> 02:45:04,194
THEIR ELECTIONEERING AND 

4775
02:45:04,194 --> 02:45:04,828
THREATENING DOESN'T WORK. 

4776
02:45:04,828 --> 02:45:06,596

4778
02:45:09,466 --> 02:45:12,035

5043
02:54:18,314 --> 02:54:19,115
NOMINATED BY A PRESIDENT NAMED 

5044
02:54:19,115 --> 02:54:20,216
IN OPEN COURT AS DIRECTING 

5045
02:54:20,216 --> 02:54:21,050
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AND THE 

5046
02:54:21,050 --> 02:54:21,851
SUBJECT OF ONGOING CRIMINAL 

5047
02:54:21,851 --> 02:54:22,218
INVESTIGATION. 

5048
02:54:22,218 --> 02:54:22,818
YOU DISPLAYED EXPANSIVE VIEWS 

5049
02:54:22,818 --> 02:54:23,886
ON EXECUTIVE IMMUNITY FROM THE 

5050
02:54:23,886 --> 02:54:24,086
LAW. 

5051
02:54:24,086 --> 02:54:26,222
IF YOU ARE IN THAT SEAT BECAUSE 

5052
02:54:26,222 --> 02:54:27,490
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BIG 

5053
02:54:27,490 --> 02:54:28,491
EXPECTATIONS THAT YOU WILL 

5054
02:54:28,491 --> 02:54:29,125
PROTECT THE PRESIDENT FROM THE 

5055
02:54:29,125 --> 02:54:30,326
DUE PROCESS OF LAW, THAT SHOULD 

5056
02:54:30,326 --> 02:54:33,362
GIVE EVERY SENATOR PAUSE. 

5057
02:54:33,362 --> 02:54:35,164
TOMORROW WE WILL HEAR A LOT OF 

5058
02:54:35,164 --> 02:54:36,198
CONFIRMATION ETIQUETTE. 

5059
02:54:36,198 --> 02:54:37,133
IT IS MOSTLY A SHAM. 

5060
02:54:37,133 --> 02:54:38,334
YOU KNOW THE GAME. 

5061
02:54:38,334 --> 02:54:39,901
IN THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE, YOU 

5062
02:54:39,901 --> 02:54:47,343
COACHED JUDICIAL NOMINEES TO 

5063
02:54:47,343 --> 02:54:48,478
JUST TELL SENATORS THAT THEY 

5064
02:54:48,478 --> 02:54:49,178
HAVE A COMMITMENT TO FOLLOW 

5065
02:54:49,178 --> 02:54:50,012
SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT AND 

5066
02:54:50,012 --> 02:54:51,013
WILL ADHERE TO STATUTORY TEXT 

5067
02:54:51,013 --> 02:54:52,014
AND THAT THEY HAVE NO 

5068
02:54:52,014 --> 02:54:52,915
IDEOLOGICAL AGENDA. 

5069
02:54:52,915 --> 02:55:01,390
FAIRYTALES. 

5070
02:55:01,390 --> 02:55:02,525
AT HIS HEARING, JUSTICE ROBERTS 

5071
02:55:02,525 --> 02:55:03,493
INFAMOUSLY SAID HE JUST CALLED 

5072
02:55:03,493 --> 02:55:05,127
BALLS AND STRIKES, BUT THIS 

5073
02:55:05,127 --> 02:55:09,131
PATTERN, 73-0 OF THE ROBERTS 

5074
02:55:09,131 --> 02:55:10,132
FIVE, QUALIFIES HIM TO HAVE 

5075
02:55:10,132 --> 02:55:11,601
NASCAR STYLE CORPORATE BADGES 

5076
02:55:11,601 --> 02:55:13,603
ON HIS ROADS. 

5077
02:55:13,603 --> 02:55:15,338
A LETO SENATE AFFAIR BUT A 

5078
02:55:15,338 --> 02:55:21,310
STRONG -- -- JUSTICE ALITO TOLD 

5079
02:55:21,310 --> 02:55:23,112
THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY THAT 

5080
02:55:23,112 --> 02:55:26,048
THINGS NEED TO LEAVE DECIDED 

5081
02:55:26,048 --> 02:55:36,325
WHEN IT SUITS OUR PURPOSES. 

5082
02:55:36,325 --> 02:55:37,260
JUSTICE GORSUCH PROVIDED THE 

5083
02:55:37,260 --> 02:55:38,261
KEY VOTE IN THE UNIONBUSTING 

5084
02:55:38,261 --> 02:55:38,527
DECISION. 

5085
02:55:38,527 --> 02:55:39,595
HE ALSO PLEDGED IN HIS HEARING 

5086
02:55:39,595 --> 02:55:42,331
TO FOLLOW THE LAW OF JUDICIAL  

5087
02:55:42,331 --> 02:55:42,731
JUSTICE GORSUCH. 

5088
02:55:42,731 --> 02:55:43,966
ASSURED US HE WAS NOT A 

5089
02:55:43,966 --> 02:55:44,767
PHILOSOPHER KING AND PROMISED 

5090
02:55:44,767 --> 02:55:46,002
TO GIVE EQUAL CONCERN TO EVERY 

5091
02:55:46,002 --> 02:55:47,536
PERSON , POOR RICH, MIGHTY OR 

5092
02:55:47,536 --> 02:55:48,704
MEEK. 

5093
02:55:48,704 --> 02:55:49,705
HOW DID THAT TURN OUT? 

5094
02:55:49,705 --> 02:55:57,747
GREAT FOR THE RICH AND MIGHTY. 

5095
02:55:57,747 --> 02:55:58,848
JUSTICE GORSUCH IS THE SINGLE 

5096
02:55:58,848 --> 02:55:59,582
MOST CORPORATE FRIENDLY JUSTICE 

5097
02:55:59,582 --> 02:56:00,683
ON A COURT ALREADY FULL OF 

5098
02:56:00,683 --> 02:56:01,784
THEM, REALLY FOR BIG BUSINESS 

5099
02:56:01,784 --> 02:56:03,119
INTERESTS IN OVER 70% OF CASES  

5100
02:56:03,119 --> 02:56:05,187
AND IN EVERY SINGLE CASE WHERE 

5101
02:56:05,187 --> 02:56:10,359
HIS BOAT WAS DETERMINATIVE. 

5102
02:56:10,359 --> 02:56:11,360
THE PRESIDENT EARLY ON ASSURED 

5103
02:56:11,360 --> 02:56:12,328
EVANGELIC IS HIS SUPREME COURT 

5104
02:56:12,328 --> 02:56:13,496
PICKS WOULD ATTACK ROE V WADE. 

5105
02:56:13,496 --> 02:56:14,664
DESPITE CONFIRMATION ETIQUETTE 

5106
02:56:14,664 --> 02:56:21,404
ASSURANCES ABOUT PRECEDENT, 

5107
02:56:21,404 --> 02:56:22,538
YOUR OWN WORDS MAKE CLEAR YOU 

5108
02:56:22,538 --> 02:56:23,639
DON'T REALLY BELIEVE ROE V WADE 

5109
02:56:23,639 --> 02:56:24,941
IS SETTLED LAW SINCE THE COURT, 

5110
02:56:24,941 --> 02:56:26,075
AS YOU SAID,  CAN ALWAYS 

5111
02:56:26,075 --> 02:56:27,910
OVERRULE ITS PRECEDENT.  

5112
02:56:27,910 --> 02:56:29,679
MR. CHAIRMAN, WE HAVE SEEN THIS 

5113
02:56:29,679 --> 02:56:30,246
MOVIE BEFORE. 

5114
02:56:30,246 --> 02:56:32,314
WE KNOW HOW IT ENDS. 

5115
02:56:32,314 --> 02:56:35,384
THE SAD FACT IS THAT THERE IS 

5116
02:56:35,384 --> 02:56:37,853
NO CONSEQUENCE FOR TELLING THE 

5117
02:56:37,853 --> 02:56:45,194
COMMITTEE FAIRYTALES ABOUT 

5118
02:56:45,194 --> 02:56:46,329
STARE DECISIS AND THEN WRITING 

5119
02:56:46,329 --> 02:56:47,229
OFF WITH THE ROBERTS FIVE, 

5120
02:56:47,229 --> 02:56:47,930
TRAVELING ACROSS WHATEVER 

5121
02:56:47,930 --> 02:56:49,465
PRECEDENT GETS IN THE WAY  OF 

5122
02:56:49,465 --> 02:56:51,600
LETTING THOSE BIG REPUBLICAN 

5123
02:56:51,600 --> 02:56:54,503
INTERESTS KEEP WINNING 5-4 

5124
02:56:54,503 --> 02:56:56,305
PARTISAN DECISIONS. 

5125
02:56:56,305 --> 02:57:00,809
73-0 MR. KAVANAUGH. 

5126
02:57:00,809 --> 02:57:05,881
EVERY TIME.  

5127
02:57:05,881 --> 02:57:06,682
THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 

5128
02:57:06,682 --> 02:57:07,750
>> SENATOR TED CRUZ. 

5129
02:57:07,750 --> 02:57:09,952
>> CHAIRMAN, I HAVE SOME 

5130
02:57:09,952 --> 02:57:11,921
DOCUMENTS TO SUPPORT THIS. 

5131
02:57:11,921 --> 02:57:21,964
-- SENATOR -- 

5132
02:57:21,964 --> 02:57:23,299
>> THANK YOU JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

5133
02:57:23,299 --> 02:57:23,565
WELCOME. 

5134
02:57:23,565 --> 02:57:33,009
WELCOME TO YOUR FAMILY.  

5135
02:57:33,009 --> 02:57:34,310
YOU HAVE BEEN FRIENDS OF OURS 

5136
02:57:34,310 --> 02:57:34,744
FOR 20 YEARS. 

5137
02:57:34,744 --> 02:57:36,479
THANK YOU FOR YOUR DECADES OF 

5138
02:57:36,479 --> 02:57:38,981
PUBLIC SERVICE, AND I AM SORRY 

5139
02:57:38,981 --> 02:57:40,116
THAT YOUR DAUGHTERS HAD TO 

5140
02:57:40,116 --> 02:57:41,784
ENDURE THE POLITICAL CIRCUS OF 

5141
02:57:41,784 --> 02:57:44,387
THIS MORNING. 

5142
02:57:44,387 --> 02:57:45,287
THAT IS THE WORLD THAT IS 

5143
02:57:45,287 --> 02:57:48,290
WASHINGTON IN 2018. 

5144
02:57:48,290 --> 02:57:49,492
I WANT TO DISCUSS WHAT THIS 

5145
02:57:49,492 --> 02:57:51,560
HEARING IS ABOUT AND WHAT IT IS 

5146
02:57:51,560 --> 02:57:51,860
NOT ABOUT. 

5147
02:57:51,860 --> 02:57:54,263
FIRST, THIS HEARING IS NOT 

5148
02:57:54,263 --> 02:57:55,497
ABOUT THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE 

5149
02:57:55,497 --> 02:57:59,635
NOMINEE. 

5150
02:57:59,635 --> 02:58:00,636
JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS BY ANY 

5151
02:58:00,636 --> 02:58:01,069
OBJECTIVE MEASURE 

5152
02:58:01,069 --> 02:58:01,737
UNQUESTIONABLY QUALIFIED FOR 

5153
02:58:01,737 --> 02:58:03,572
THE SUPREME COURT.  

5154
02:58:03,572 --> 02:58:05,007
EVERYONE AGREES IS ONE OF THE 

5155
02:58:05,007 --> 02:58:05,641
MOST RESPECTED FEDERAL JUDGES 

5156
02:58:05,641 --> 02:58:18,521
IN THE COUNTRY. 

5157
02:58:18,521 --> 02:58:19,321
HE HAS IMPECCABLE ACADEMIC 

5158
02:58:19,321 --> 02:58:20,589
CREDENTIALS, EVEN IF HE DID GO 

5159
02:58:20,589 --> 02:58:21,056
TO YALE. 

5160
02:58:21,056 --> 02:58:22,491
AND YOU SERVED OVER A DECADE ON 

5161
02:58:22,491 --> 02:58:23,492
THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR 

5162
02:58:23,492 --> 02:58:24,527
THE D.C. CIRCUIT, OFTEN 

5163
02:58:24,527 --> 02:58:25,761
REFERRED TO AS THE SECOND 

5164
02:58:25,761 --> 02:58:26,361
HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND. 

5165
02:58:26,361 --> 02:58:27,363
SO OUR DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES 

5166
02:58:27,363 --> 02:58:28,597
ARE NOT TRYING TO MAKE THE 

5167
02:58:28,597 --> 02:58:29,197
ARGUMENT THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

5168
02:58:29,197 --> 02:58:30,132
IS NOT QUALIFIED. 

5169
02:58:30,132 --> 02:58:31,233
I HAVE NOT HEARD ANYONE EVEN 

5170
02:58:31,233 --> 02:58:32,268
ATTEMPT  TO MAKE THAT ARGUMENT. 

5171
02:58:32,268 --> 02:58:33,369
SECOND, THIS HEARING IS NOT 

5172
02:58:33,369 --> 02:58:38,007
ABOUT HIS JUDICIAL RECORD. 

5173
02:58:38,007 --> 02:58:39,108
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS OVER 300 

5174
02:58:39,108 --> 02:58:39,641
PUBLISHED OPINIONS, WHICH 

5175
02:58:39,641 --> 02:58:40,342
ALTOGETHER AMOUNT TO OVER 

5176
02:58:40,342 --> 02:58:41,544
10,000 PAGES  ISSUED IN HIS 

5177
02:58:41,544 --> 02:58:43,279
ROLE AS A FEDERAL APPELLATE 

5178
02:58:43,279 --> 02:58:43,979
JUDGE. 

5179
02:58:43,979 --> 02:58:44,914
EVERYONE AGREES A JUDGES RECORD 

5180
02:58:44,914 --> 02:58:52,321
IS BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT 

5181
02:58:52,321 --> 02:58:53,322
INDICATION OF WHAT KIND OF 

5182
02:58:53,322 --> 02:58:54,390
JUSTICE THAT NOMINEE WILL BE. 

5183
02:58:54,390 --> 02:58:55,391
AND TELLINGLY, WE HAVE HEARD 

5184
02:58:55,391 --> 02:58:56,225
VERY LITTLE TODAY FROM 

5185
02:58:56,225 --> 02:58:57,359
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS ABOUT THE 

5186
02:58:57,359 --> 02:58:59,829
ACTUAL SUBSTANCE OF YOUR 

5187
02:58:59,829 --> 02:59:03,933
JUDICIAL RECORD. 

5188
02:59:03,933 --> 02:59:04,867
THIRD, IT IS IMPORTANT TO 

5189
02:59:04,867 --> 02:59:06,302
UNDERSTAND TODAY IS ALSO NOT 

5190
02:59:06,302 --> 02:59:08,204
ABOUT DOCUMENTS. 

5191
02:59:08,204 --> 02:59:09,472
WE HAVE HEARD A LOT OF 

5192
02:59:09,472 --> 02:59:12,208
ARGUMENTS THIS MORNING ABOUT 

5193
02:59:12,208 --> 02:59:17,613
DOCUMENTS. 

5194
02:59:17,613 --> 02:59:18,747
THERE IS AN OLD SAYING FOR 

5195
02:59:18,747 --> 02:59:19,949
TRIAL LAWYERS, IF YOU HAVE THE 

5196
02:59:19,949 --> 02:59:20,883
FACTS, POUND THE FACTS. 

5197
02:59:20,883 --> 02:59:22,184
IF YOU HAVE THE LAW, POUND THE 

5198
02:59:22,184 --> 02:59:22,384
LAW. 

5199
02:59:22,384 --> 02:59:23,719
IF YOU HAVE NEITHER, POUND THE 

5200
02:59:23,719 --> 02:59:23,952
TABLE. 

5201
02:59:23,952 --> 02:59:25,421
WE ARE SEEING A LOT OF TABLE 

5202
02:59:25,421 --> 02:59:25,954
POUNDING THIS MORNING. 

5203
02:59:25,954 --> 02:59:26,889
THE DEMOCRATS ARE FOCUSED ON 

5204
02:59:26,889 --> 02:59:28,257
PROCEDURAL ISSUES BECAUSE THEY 

5205
02:59:28,257 --> 02:59:32,995
DON'T HAVE SUBSTANTIVE POINTS 

5206
02:59:32,995 --> 02:59:34,196
STRONG ENOUGH TO DERAIL THIS 

5207
02:59:34,196 --> 02:59:34,496
NOMINATION. 

5208
02:59:34,496 --> 02:59:35,097
THEY DON'T HAVE SUBSTANTIVE 

5209
02:59:35,097 --> 02:59:36,232
CRITICISM WITH YOUR ACTUAL THE 

5210
02:59:36,232 --> 02:59:37,399
OFFICIAL RECORD, SO THEY'RE 

5211
02:59:37,399 --> 02:59:42,504
TRYING TO DIVERT EVERYONE WITH 

5212
02:59:42,504 --> 02:59:43,105
PROCEDURAL ISSUES. 

5213
02:59:43,105 --> 02:59:44,473
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE DOCUMENTS 

5214
02:59:44,473 --> 02:59:47,376
FOR MOMENT. 

5215
02:59:47,376 --> 02:59:48,377
THE CLAIMS THAT THE DEMOCRATS 

5216
02:59:48,377 --> 02:59:49,211
ARE PUTTING FORWARD ON 

5217
02:59:49,211 --> 02:59:50,012
DOCUMENTS DON'T WITHSTAND ANY 

5218
02:59:50,012 --> 02:59:50,412
SERIOUS SCRUTINY. 

5219
02:59:50,412 --> 02:59:54,450
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS PRODUCED  

5220
02:59:54,450 --> 02:59:58,954
511,948 PAGES OF DOCUMENTS. 

5221
02:59:58,954 --> 03:00:00,422
THAT INCLUDES MORE THAN 17,000 

5222
03:00:00,422 --> 03:00:07,730
PAGES IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE 

5223
03:00:07,730 --> 03:00:08,330
COMMITTEE WRITTEN 

5224
03:00:08,330 --> 03:00:09,164
QUESTIONNAIRE, WHICH IS THE 

5225
03:00:09,164 --> 03:00:09,764
MOST COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE 

5226
03:00:09,764 --> 03:00:10,799
EVER SUBMITTED TO THIS 

5227
03:00:10,799 --> 03:00:12,601
COMMITTEE. 

5228
03:00:12,601 --> 03:00:13,702
THE MORE THAN 500,000 PAGES OF 

5229
03:00:13,702 --> 03:00:15,471
DOCUMENTS TURNED INTO THIS 

5230
03:00:15,471 --> 03:00:19,175
COMMITTEE IS MORE THAN THE 

5231
03:00:19,175 --> 03:00:20,276
NUMBER OF PAGES WE HAVE 

5232
03:00:20,276 --> 03:00:21,110
RECEIVED FOR THE LAST FIVE 

5233
03:00:21,110 --> 03:00:30,419
SUPREME COURT NOMINEES COMBINED.

5234
03:00:30,419 --> 03:00:31,654
LISTEN TO THAT FACT AGAIN. 

5235
03:00:31,654 --> 03:00:32,288
THE OVER 500,000 DOCUMENTS 

5236
03:00:32,288 --> 03:00:33,488
TURNED OVER TO THIS COMMITTEE 

5237
03:00:33,488 --> 03:00:34,523
IS MORE THAN THE LAST FIVE 

5238
03:00:34,523 --> 03:00:36,225
NOMINEES SUBMITTED TO THIS 

5239
03:00:36,225 --> 03:00:37,393
COMMITTEE COMBINED. 

5240
03:00:37,393 --> 03:00:38,694
SO WHAT IS ALL THE FUSS OVER 

5241
03:00:38,694 --> 03:00:39,728
THE DOCUMENTS NOT TURNED OVER? 

5242
03:00:39,728 --> 03:00:41,830
MOST OF THOSE CONCERNED YOUR 

5243
03:00:41,830 --> 03:00:42,665
THREE YEARS AS THE STAFF 

5244
03:00:42,665 --> 03:00:44,033
SECRETARY FOR PRESIDENT GEORGE 

5245
03:00:44,033 --> 03:00:44,900
W. BUSH. 

5246
03:00:44,900 --> 03:00:46,569
MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT A 

5247
03:00:46,569 --> 03:00:49,738
STAFF SECRETARY DOES. 

5248
03:00:49,738 --> 03:00:50,940
BUT THAT IS THE POSITION IN 

5249
03:00:50,940 --> 03:00:52,174
CHARGE OF ALL THE PAPER THAT 

5250
03:00:52,174 --> 03:00:54,009
COMES INTO AND OUT OF THE OVAL 

5251
03:00:54,009 --> 03:00:54,242
OFFICE. 

5252
03:00:54,242 --> 03:00:55,010
CRITICALLY, THE STAFF SECRETARY 

5253
03:00:55,010 --> 03:01:05,387
IS NOT THE AUTHOR OF THE PAPER 

5254
03:01:05,387 --> 03:01:06,588
COMING INTO AND OUT OF THE OVAL 

5255
03:01:06,588 --> 03:01:07,022
OFFICE. 

5256
03:01:07,022 --> 03:01:07,623
THAT PAPERS TYPICALLY WRITTEN 

5257
03:01:07,623 --> 03:01:08,857
BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, BY THE 

5258
03:01:08,857 --> 03:01:09,959
SECRETARY OF STATE, BUT OTHER 

5259
03:01:09,959 --> 03:01:10,693
CABINET MEMBERS, BY OTHER 

5260
03:01:10,693 --> 03:01:11,594
SENIOR WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS. 

5261
03:01:11,594 --> 03:01:12,528
THE STAFF SECRETARY IS SIMPLY 

5262
03:01:12,528 --> 03:01:13,629
THE FUNNEL FOR COLLECTING THEIR 

5263
03:01:13,629 --> 03:01:14,663
VIEWS AND THEN FOR TRANSFERRING 

5264
03:01:14,663 --> 03:01:15,564
THE PAPER BACK AND FORTH. 

5265
03:01:15,564 --> 03:01:16,899
IN OTHER WORDS, THOSE DOCUMENTS 

5266
03:01:16,899 --> 03:01:18,033
WRITTEN BY OTHER PEOPLE SAY 

5267
03:01:18,033 --> 03:01:25,074
NOTHING, ZERO, ABOUT THE VIEWS 

5268
03:01:25,074 --> 03:01:25,908
OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND NOTHING, 

5269
03:01:25,908 --> 03:01:27,109
ZERO, ABOUT WHAT KIND OF 

5270
03:01:27,109 --> 03:01:28,310
JUSTICE  JUDGE KAVANAUGH WOULD 

5271
03:01:28,310 --> 03:01:29,478
MAKE.  

5272
03:01:29,478 --> 03:01:37,653
BUT THEY ARE, BY NECESSITY, THE 

5273
03:01:37,653 --> 03:01:38,387
MOST SENSITIVE AND CONFIDENTIAL 

5274
03:01:38,387 --> 03:01:39,188
DOCUMENTS ANY WHITE HOUSE. 

5275
03:01:39,188 --> 03:01:44,226
THEY ARE THE DOCUMENTS GOING TO 

5276
03:01:44,226 --> 03:01:50,399
THE PRESIDENT. 

5277
03:01:50,399 --> 03:01:51,533
THIS IS THE ADVICE AND DOUBLE 

5278
03:01:51,533 --> 03:01:52,735
RATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT AT THE 

5279
03:01:52,735 --> 03:01:53,936
SENIOR LEVEL AND THE STAFF 

5280
03:01:53,936 --> 03:01:54,937
SECRETARY IS THE CONDUIT FOR 

5281
03:01:54,937 --> 03:01:55,337
THOSE DOCUMENTS. 

5282
03:01:55,337 --> 03:01:56,772
SO WHY IS IT THAT THE DEMOCRATS 

5283
03:01:56,772 --> 03:01:58,207
ARE PUTTING SO MUCH ENERGY IN 

5284
03:01:58,207 --> 03:01:59,108
SAYING HAND OVER ALL OF THOSE 

5285
03:01:59,108 --> 03:01:59,408
DOCUMENTS? 

5286
03:01:59,408 --> 03:02:00,242
BECAUSE THEY KNOW, THEY KNOW 

5287
03:02:00,242 --> 03:02:01,643
BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT, 

5288
03:02:01,643 --> 03:02:02,444
THAT PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH 

5289
03:02:02,444 --> 03:02:03,679
AND HIS WHITE HOUSE TEAM ARE 

5290
03:02:03,679 --> 03:02:05,080
NOT GOING TO ALLOW EVERY PIECE 

5291
03:02:05,080 --> 03:02:06,115
OF PAPER THAT WENT TO THE 

5292
03:02:06,115 --> 03:02:07,216
PRESIDENT TO BE MADE PUBLIC 

5293
03:02:07,216 --> 03:02:08,817
ANYMORE THAN ANY OTHER WHITE 

5294
03:02:08,817 --> 03:02:11,086
HOUSE WOULD. 

5295
03:02:11,086 --> 03:02:11,887
REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT, NO 

5296
03:02:11,887 --> 03:02:12,888
WHITE HOUSE WOULD ALLOW EVERY 

5297
03:02:12,888 --> 03:02:14,356
PIECE OF PAPER THAT WENT TO AND 

5298
03:02:14,356 --> 03:02:16,058
FROM THE PRESIDENT TO BE MADE 

5299
03:02:16,058 --> 03:02:16,358
PUBLIC. 

5300
03:02:16,358 --> 03:02:20,062
INDEED, THERE ARE RULES AND 

5301
03:02:20,062 --> 03:02:20,963
LAWS AND PROCEDURES FOR WHEN 

5302
03:02:20,963 --> 03:02:22,331
AND HOW PRESIDENTIAL PAPERS 

5303
03:02:22,331 --> 03:02:23,599
BECOME PUBLIC. 

5304
03:02:23,599 --> 03:02:24,633
AND THE REASON THE DEMOCRATS 

5305
03:02:24,633 --> 03:02:26,402
ARE FIGHTING SO LOUDLY ON THIS 

5306
03:02:26,402 --> 03:02:45,220
ISSUE IS --. IT WOULD OPEN UP 

5307
03:02:45,220 --> 03:02:46,121
ALL SORTS OF FISHING 

5308
03:02:46,121 --> 03:02:46,621
EXPEDITIONS TO ATTACK, 

5309
03:02:46,621 --> 03:02:47,556
RELITIGATE THE RECORD OF GEORGE 

5310
03:02:47,556 --> 03:02:48,991
W. BUSH AS PRESIDENT AND WHAT 

5311
03:02:48,991 --> 03:02:50,025
VARIOUS CABINET MEMBERS AND 

5312
03:02:50,025 --> 03:02:51,393
SENIOR VISORS MIGHT OR MIGHT 

5313
03:02:51,393 --> 03:02:54,596
NOT OF SAID. 

5314
03:02:54,596 --> 03:02:56,298
BUT IT IS AT THE END OF THE DAY 

5315
03:02:56,298 --> 03:02:57,332
IS SIMPLY AN ATTEMPT TO 

5316
03:02:57,332 --> 03:02:58,133
DISTRACT AND DELAY. 

5317
03:02:58,133 --> 03:02:58,733
AND INDEED, THE MULTIPLE 

5318
03:02:58,733 --> 03:02:59,768
MOTIONS WE HAVE SEEN FROM 

5319
03:02:59,768 --> 03:03:00,469
DEMOCRATS, DELAY THIS 

5320
03:03:00,469 --> 03:03:01,169
CONFIRMATION, THAT REVEALS THE 

5321
03:03:01,169 --> 03:03:01,570
WHOLE JOKE. 

5322
03:03:01,570 --> 03:03:06,241
THE OBJECTIVE IS DELAY. 

5323
03:03:06,241 --> 03:03:07,242
SO WHAT IS THIS FIGHT ABOUT? 

5324
03:03:07,242 --> 03:03:09,011
IT IS NOT ABOUT DOCUMENTS, IS 

5325
03:03:09,011 --> 03:03:10,112
NOT ABOUT THE CREDENTIALS OF 

5326
03:03:10,112 --> 03:03:11,847
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, WHAT IS THIS 

5327
03:03:11,847 --> 03:03:12,915
FIGHT ABOUT?  

5328
03:03:12,915 --> 03:03:14,249
I BELIEVE THIS FIGHT IS NOTHING 

5329
03:03:14,249 --> 03:03:19,021
MORE AND NOTHING LESS THAN AN 

5330
03:03:19,021 --> 03:03:19,822
ATTEMPT BY OUR DEMOCRATIC 

5331
03:03:19,822 --> 03:03:20,489
COLLEAGUES TO RELITIGATE THE 

5332
03:03:20,489 --> 03:03:22,825
2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. 

5333
03:03:22,825 --> 03:03:24,293
2016 WAS A HARD-FOUGHT ELECTION 

5334
03:03:24,293 --> 03:03:30,833
ALL AROUND. 

5335
03:03:30,833 --> 03:03:31,867
IT WAS THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL 

5336
03:03:31,867 --> 03:03:32,868
ELECTION IN 60 YEARS WHERE 

5337
03:03:32,868 --> 03:03:33,869
AMERICANS WENT TO THE POLLS 

5338
03:03:33,869 --> 03:03:35,070
WITH A VACANT SEAT ON THE 

5339
03:03:35,070 --> 03:03:35,470
SUPREME COURT. 

5340
03:03:35,470 --> 03:03:36,305
ONE THAT THE NEXT PRESIDENT 

5341
03:03:36,305 --> 03:03:39,041
WOULD FILL. 

5342
03:03:39,041 --> 03:03:40,542
AMERICANS KNEW WHO HAD BEEN IN 

5343
03:03:40,542 --> 03:03:45,047
THAT SEAT, THE LATE JUSTICE 

5344
03:03:45,047 --> 03:03:46,148
ANTONIN SCALIA, ONE OF THE 

5345
03:03:46,148 --> 03:03:47,716
GREATEST JURISTS EVER TO SIT ON 

5346
03:03:47,716 --> 03:03:49,385
THE SUPREME COURT. 

5347
03:03:49,385 --> 03:03:50,819
AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SINCE 

5348
03:03:50,819 --> 03:03:52,888
PRESIDENT DWIGHT EISENHOWER HIS 

5349
03:03:52,888 --> 03:03:53,355
 

5350
03:03:53,355 --> 03:03:54,289
SUPREME COURT SEAT WAS DIRECTLY 

5351
03:03:54,289 --> 03:03:55,357
ON THE BALLOT. 

5352
03:03:55,357 --> 03:03:59,695
BOTH CANDIDATES KNEW THE 

5353
03:03:59,695 --> 03:04:00,329
IMPORTANCE OF THE VACANT 

5354
03:04:00,329 --> 03:04:00,996
SUPREME COURT SEAT. 

5355
03:04:00,996 --> 03:04:02,131
IT WAS A MAJOR ISSUE OF 

5356
03:04:02,131 --> 03:04:03,531
CONTENTION IN THE PRESIDENTIAL 

5357
03:04:03,531 --> 03:04:09,571
ELECTION. 

5358
03:04:09,571 --> 03:04:10,339
DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY 

5359
03:04:10,339 --> 03:04:11,440
CLINTON WERE BOTH CLEAR ABOUT 

5360
03:04:11,440 --> 03:04:12,241
WHAT KIND OF JUSTICES AND 

5361
03:04:12,241 --> 03:04:13,242
JUDGES THEY WOULD APPOINT. 

5362
03:04:13,242 --> 03:04:13,909
DURING ALL THREE PRESIDENTIAL 

5363
03:04:13,909 --> 03:04:14,777
DEBATES, BOTH CANDIDATES WERE 

5364
03:04:14,777 --> 03:04:15,711
ASKED, WHAT QUALITIES WERE MOST 

5365
03:04:15,711 --> 03:04:16,712
IMPORTANT TO THEM WHEN 

5366
03:04:16,712 --> 03:04:20,315
SELECTING A SUPREME COURT 

5367
03:04:20,315 --> 03:04:26,455
JUSTICE. 

5368
03:04:26,455 --> 03:04:27,389
THE ANSWER BY SECRETARY CLINTON 

5369
03:04:27,389 --> 03:04:28,724
WAS QUICK, SHE WANTED A JUSTICE 

5370
03:04:28,724 --> 03:04:29,758
WHO WOULD BE A LIBERAL 

5371
03:04:29,758 --> 03:04:30,792
PROGRESSIVE WILLING TO REWRITE 

5372
03:04:30,792 --> 03:04:31,593
THE U.S. CONSTITUTION, WILLING 

5373
03:04:31,593 --> 03:04:35,531
TO IMPOSE LIBERAL POLICY AGENDAS

5374
03:04:35,531 --> 03:04:36,865
THAT SHE COULD NOT GET THROUGH 

5375
03:04:36,865 --> 03:04:37,432
THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. 

5376
03:04:37,432 --> 03:04:38,801
úTHAT T 

5377
03:04:38,801 --> 03:04:40,235
STATES WOULD NOT ADOPT, BUT 

5378
03:04:40,235 --> 03:04:41,403
THAT SHE HOPED FIVE UNELECTED 

5379
03:04:41,403 --> 03:04:42,604
LAWYERS WOULD FORCE ON THE 

5380
03:04:42,604 --> 03:04:43,004
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

5381
03:04:43,004 --> 03:04:43,839
THAT IS WHAT HILLARY CLINTON 

5382
03:04:43,839 --> 03:04:45,240
PROMISED FOR HER JUDICIAL 

5383
03:04:45,240 --> 03:04:45,574
NOMINEES. 

5384
03:04:45,574 --> 03:04:51,046
THEN CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP 

5385
03:04:51,046 --> 03:04:52,247
GAVE A VERY DIFFERENT ANSWER. 

5386
03:04:52,247 --> 03:04:53,282
HE SAYS HE WAS LOOKING TO 

5387
03:04:53,282 --> 03:04:54,516
APPOINT JUDGES IN THE MOLD OF 

5388
03:04:54,516 --> 03:04:54,916
JUSTICE SCALIA. 

5389
03:04:54,916 --> 03:04:56,218
HE SAID HE WANTED TO APPOINT 

5390
03:04:56,218 --> 03:04:57,552
JUDGES WHO WOULD INTERPRET THE 

5391
03:04:57,552 --> 03:04:59,588
CONSTITUTION BASED ON ITS 

5392
03:04:59,588 --> 03:05:00,121
ORIGINAL PUBLIC MEETING. 

5393
03:05:00,121 --> 03:05:03,625
WHO WOULD INTERPRET THE STATUTES

5394
03:05:03,625 --> 03:05:05,093
ACCORDING TO THE TEXT AND WHO 

5395
03:05:05,093 --> 03:05:06,328
WOULD UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW 

5396
03:05:06,328 --> 03:05:07,429
AND TREAT PARTIES FAIRLY 

5397
03:05:07,429 --> 03:05:08,530
REGARDLESS OF WHO THEY ARE OR 

5398
03:05:08,530 --> 03:05:14,036
WHERE THEY COME FROM. 

5399
03:05:14,036 --> 03:05:15,003
THEN CANDIDATE TRENT -- THEN 

5400
03:05:15,003 --> 03:05:16,338
CANDIDATE TRUMP HAD DID 

5401
03:05:16,338 --> 03:05:21,410
SOMETHING THAT NO PRESIDENTIAL 

5402
03:05:21,410 --> 03:05:22,411
CANDIDATE HAS DONE BEFORE, HE 

5403
03:05:22,411 --> 03:05:23,912
WOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF 

5404
03:05:23,912 --> 03:05:24,313
NOMINEES. 

5405
03:05:24,313 --> 03:05:27,082
PROVIDING TRANSPARENCY TO THE 

5406
03:05:27,082 --> 03:05:27,482
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

5407
03:05:27,482 --> 03:05:28,850
ALL OF THIS WOULD LAY BEFORE 

5408
03:05:28,850 --> 03:05:29,851
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AS THEY 

5409
03:05:29,851 --> 03:05:31,420
WENT TO THE POLLS ON NOVEMBER 

5410
03:05:31,420 --> 03:05:33,822
8, 2016. 

5411
03:05:33,822 --> 03:05:34,556
AND THE IT. 

5412
03:05:34,556 --> 03:05:35,991
OF PEOPLE MADE A CHOICE THAT I. 

5413
03:05:35,991 --> 03:05:36,591
MY DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES ARE 

5414
03:05:36,591 --> 03:05:38,527
NOT HAPPY WITH THE CHOICE THE 

5415
03:05:38,527 --> 03:05:39,428
AMERICAN PEOPLE MADE. 

5416
03:05:39,428 --> 03:05:41,029
BUT AS PRESIDENT OBAMA FAMOUSLY 

5417
03:05:41,029 --> 03:05:44,333
SAID, ELECTIONS HAVE 

5418
03:05:44,333 --> 03:05:45,434
CONSEQUENCES. 

5419
03:05:45,434 --> 03:05:46,535
BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAD 

5420
03:05:46,535 --> 03:05:49,938
THE CHANCE TO VOTE A NATIONAL 

5421
03:05:49,938 --> 03:05:51,273
REFERENDUM ON THE DIRECTION OF 

5422
03:05:51,273 --> 03:05:52,908
THE SUPREME COURT, I HAVE SENT 

5423
03:05:52,908 --> 03:06:02,251
A NUMBER OF TIMES THAT JUSTICE 

5424
03:06:02,251 --> 03:06:03,352
-- THAT THE NOMINATION OF 

5425
03:06:03,352 --> 03:06:04,186
JUSTICE GORSUCH AND THIS 

5426
03:06:04,186 --> 03:06:05,287
NOMINATION HAVE ALMOST A SUPER 

5427
03:06:05,287 --> 03:06:06,221
LEGITIMACY IN THAT THEY WERE 

5428
03:06:06,221 --> 03:06:07,022
RATIFIED, DECIDED  BY THE 

5429
03:06:07,022 --> 03:06:08,056
AMERICAN PEOPLE IN A DIRECT 

5430
03:06:08,056 --> 03:06:12,127
VOTE IN 2016. 

5431
03:06:12,127 --> 03:06:12,727
IS SO THE DEMOCRATIC 

5432
03:06:12,727 --> 03:06:13,762
OBSTRUCTION TODAY IS ALL ABOUT 

5433
03:06:13,762 --> 03:06:14,963
TRYING TO REVERSE THAT 

5434
03:06:14,963 --> 03:06:15,230
ELECTION. 

5435
03:06:15,230 --> 03:06:15,998
THEY ARE UNHAPPY WITH THE 

5436
03:06:15,998 --> 03:06:21,470
CHOICE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT.

5437
03:06:21,470 --> 03:06:22,938
AND THERE IS A REASON THAT THE 

5438
03:06:22,938 --> 03:06:23,872
AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT STRONG 

5439
03:06:23,872 --> 03:06:25,040
CONSTITUTIONALISTS ON THE US 

5440
03:06:25,040 --> 03:06:26,308
SUPREME COURT. 

5441
03:06:26,308 --> 03:06:27,542
MOST AMERICANS, AND I KNOW THE 

5442
03:06:27,542 --> 03:06:30,979
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF TEXANS,

5443
03:06:30,979 --> 03:06:32,213
WANT JUDGES WHO WILL FOLLOW THE 

5444
03:06:32,213 --> 03:06:33,982
LAW AND WILL NOT IMPOSE THEIR 

5445
03:06:33,982 --> 03:06:37,085
POLICY PREFERENCES ON THE REST 

5446
03:06:37,085 --> 03:06:38,286
OF US AND WHO WILL BE FAITHFUL 

5447
03:06:38,286 --> 03:06:39,588
TO THE CONSTITUTION AND THE 

5448
03:06:39,588 --> 03:06:43,292
BILL OF RIGHTS. 

5449
03:06:43,292 --> 03:06:44,126
JUSTICES WHO WILL UPHOLD 

5450
03:06:44,126 --> 03:06:44,826
FUNDAMENTAL LIBERTIES LIKE FREE 

5451
03:06:44,826 --> 03:06:45,727
SPEECH, LIKE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, 

5452
03:06:45,727 --> 03:06:46,461
LIKE THE SECOND AMENDMENT. 

5453
03:06:46,461 --> 03:06:48,230
THAT IS WHAT THE SELECTION WAS 

5454
03:06:48,230 --> 03:06:51,533
ABOUT, AND IF YOU LOOK AT EACH 

5455
03:06:51,533 --> 03:06:51,800
OF THESE. 

5456
03:06:51,800 --> 03:06:52,968
LET'S TAKE FREE SPEECH. 

5457
03:06:52,968 --> 03:06:56,571
IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT IN 2014 

5458
03:06:56,571 --> 03:06:57,839
EVERY DEMOCRATIC MEMBER OF THIS 

5459
03:06:57,839 --> 03:07:01,810
COMMITTEE VOTED TO AMEND THE 

5460
03:07:01,810 --> 03:07:04,279
UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION TO 

5461
03:07:04,279 --> 03:07:05,214
REPEAL THE FREE-SPEECH 

5462
03:07:05,214 --> 03:07:06,181
PROVISIONS OF THE FIRST 

5463
03:07:06,181 --> 03:07:09,151
AMENDMENT. 

5464
03:07:09,151 --> 03:07:10,085
AND SADLY, EVERY DEMOCRAT IN 

5465
03:07:10,085 --> 03:07:11,453
THE SENATE AGREED WITH THAT 

5466
03:07:11,453 --> 03:07:13,121
POSITION. 

5467
03:07:13,121 --> 03:07:14,389
VOTING TO GIVE CONGRESS 

5468
03:07:14,389 --> 03:07:15,457
UNPRECEDENTED POWER TO REGULATE 

5469
03:07:15,457 --> 03:07:19,361
POLITICAL SPEECH. 

5470
03:07:19,361 --> 03:07:20,796
IT WAS A SAD DAY FOR THIS 

5471
03:07:20,796 --> 03:07:21,129
INSTITUTION. 

5472
03:07:21,129 --> 03:07:24,233
YEARS EARLIER, TED KENNEDY, THE 

5473
03:07:24,233 --> 03:07:27,169
GREAT LIBERAL LION, OPPOSED A 

5474
03:07:27,169 --> 03:07:27,703
VERY SIMILAR EFFORT. 

5475
03:07:27,703 --> 03:07:28,971
INTENT KENNEDY SAID WE HAVE NOT 

5476
03:07:28,971 --> 03:07:32,841
AMENDED THE BILL OF RIGHTS -- 

5477
03:07:32,841 --> 03:07:34,142
AND TED KENNEDY SAID WE HAVE 

5478
03:07:34,142 --> 03:07:35,777
NOT AMENDED THE BILL OF RIGHTS 

5479
03:07:35,777 --> 03:07:39,448
IN OVER 200 YEARS, NOW IS NOT 

5480
03:07:39,448 --> 03:07:39,948
THE TIME. 

5481
03:07:39,948 --> 03:07:41,249
THE SENATE HAD THE COURAGE TO 

5482
03:07:41,249 --> 03:07:42,650
AGREE WITH HIM AND SUPPORT FREE-

5483
03:07:42,650 --> 03:07:43,618
SPEECH. 

5484
03:07:43,618 --> 03:07:50,859
THEY VOTED PARTYLINE TO REPEAL 

5485
03:07:50,859 --> 03:07:51,493
THE FREE-SPEECH PROVISIONS OF 

5486
03:07:51,493 --> 03:07:52,060
THE FIRST AMENDMENT. 

5487
03:07:52,060 --> 03:07:53,195
THAT IS RADICAL AND EXTREME AND 

5488
03:07:53,195 --> 03:07:56,231
PART OF THE REASON THE AMERICAN 

5489
03:07:56,231 --> 03:07:58,166
PEOPLE VOTED FOR A PRESIDENT 

5490
03:07:58,166 --> 03:07:59,568
WHO WOULD PUT JUSTICES ON THE 

5491
03:07:59,568 --> 03:08:00,602
COURT WHO WOULD PROTECT FREE 

5492
03:08:00,602 --> 03:08:00,835
SPEECH. 

5493
03:08:00,835 --> 03:08:01,436
HOW ABOUT RELIGIOUS LIBERTY? 

5494
03:08:01,436 --> 03:08:02,737
THAT IS ANOTHER FUNDAMENTAL 

5495
03:08:02,737 --> 03:08:04,639
PROTECTION. 

5496
03:08:04,639 --> 03:08:05,640
THAT THE DEMOCRATS IN THE 

5497
03:08:05,640 --> 03:08:08,310
SENATE HAVE GOTTEN EXTREME AND 

5498
03:08:08,310 --> 03:08:14,583
RADICAL ON. 

5499
03:08:14,583 --> 03:08:15,384
INDEED, OUR DEMOCRATIC 

5500
03:08:15,384 --> 03:08:16,084
COLLEAGUES WANT JUSTICES WHO 

5501
03:08:16,084 --> 03:08:17,018
WILL RUBBERSTAMP EFFORTS LIKE 

5502
03:08:17,018 --> 03:08:17,551
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION 

5503
03:08:17,551 --> 03:08:18,353
EFFORTS LITIGATING AGAINST THE 

5504
03:08:18,353 --> 03:08:19,654
LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR. 

5505
03:08:19,654 --> 03:08:20,555
LITIGATING AGAINST CATHOLIC 

5506
03:08:20,555 --> 03:08:21,923
NUNS TRYING TO FORCE THEM TO 

5507
03:08:21,923 --> 03:08:23,291
PAY FOR ABORTION INDUCING DRUGS 

5508
03:08:23,291 --> 03:08:25,394
AND OTHERS. 

5509
03:08:25,394 --> 03:08:27,095
THAT IS A RADICAL AND EXTREME 

5510
03:08:27,095 --> 03:08:31,900
PROPOSITION AND TO SHOW JUST 

5511
03:08:31,900 --> 03:08:32,667
HOW DRAMATIC SENATE DEMOCRATS 

5512
03:08:32,667 --> 03:08:33,502
HAVE GOTTEN, EVERY SINGLE 

5513
03:08:33,502 --> 03:08:34,703
SENATE DEMOCRAT JUST A FEW 

5514
03:08:34,703 --> 03:08:46,648
YEARS AGO VOTED TO GUT THE 

5515
03:08:46,648 --> 03:08:47,282
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION 

5516
03:08:47,282 --> 03:08:47,482
ACT. 

5517
03:08:47,482 --> 03:08:47,982
LEGISLATION THAT PASSED 

5518
03:08:47,982 --> 03:08:48,550
CONGRESS WITH OVERWHELMING 

5519
03:08:48,550 --> 03:08:49,618
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN 1993 AND 

5520
03:08:49,618 --> 03:08:51,486
WAS SIGNED INTO LAW BY BILL 

5521
03:08:51,486 --> 03:08:51,752
CLINTON. 

5522
03:08:51,752 --> 03:08:55,257
YET DUDE -- THE DEMOCRATIC 

5523
03:08:55,257 --> 03:08:55,824
PARTY DETERMINED RELIGIOUS 

5524
03:08:55,824 --> 03:08:56,358
FREEDOM WAS INCONVENIENT. 

5525
03:08:56,358 --> 03:09:00,929
THEY WANT JUSTICES THAT WILL 

5526
03:09:00,929 --> 03:09:01,530
FURTHER THAT ASSAULT ON 

5527
03:09:01,530 --> 03:09:02,030
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. 

5528
03:09:02,030 --> 03:09:03,732
AND FINALLY LET'S TAKE THE 

5529
03:09:03,732 --> 03:09:06,201
SECOND AMENDMENT. 

5530
03:09:06,201 --> 03:09:07,002
THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES, 

5531
03:09:07,002 --> 03:09:07,636
HILLARY CLINTON EXPRESSLY 

5532
03:09:07,636 --> 03:09:08,270
PROMISED TO NOMINATE JUSTICES 

5533
03:09:08,270 --> 03:09:13,175
WHO WOULD OVERTURN HELLER 

5534
03:09:13,175 --> 03:09:14,209
VERSUS DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. 

5535
03:09:14,209 --> 03:09:14,909
THAT IS THE LANDMARK DECISION 

5536
03:09:14,909 --> 03:09:21,216
ISSUED BY JUSTICE SCALIA, 

5537
03:09:21,216 --> 03:09:22,217
LIKELY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT 

5538
03:09:22,217 --> 03:09:23,051
DECISION OF HIS ENTIRE TENURE 

5539
03:09:23,051 --> 03:09:23,652
ON THE BENCH. 

5540
03:09:23,652 --> 03:09:24,953
IT UPHELD THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHT 

5541
03:09:24,953 --> 03:09:25,854
TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. 

5542
03:09:25,854 --> 03:09:27,255
THE HILLARY -- HILLARY CLINTON 

5543
03:09:27,255 --> 03:09:29,057
WANTED JUDGES WHO WOULD 

5544
03:09:29,057 --> 03:09:30,392
OVERTURN IT AND AND NUMBER OF 

5545
03:09:30,392 --> 03:09:31,560
DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES WANT THAT 

5546
03:09:31,560 --> 03:09:36,665
AS WELL. 

5547
03:09:36,665 --> 03:09:37,499
OVERTURNING THIS I BELIEVE WILL 

5548
03:09:37,499 --> 03:09:38,600
BE A TRULY RADICAL PROPOSITION. 

5549
03:09:38,600 --> 03:09:39,935
TO UNDERSTAND WHY, YOU HAVE TO 

5550
03:09:39,935 --> 03:09:49,044
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CENTER IS. 

5551
03:09:49,044 --> 03:09:49,745
THE SECOND AMENDMENT PROTECTS 

5552
03:09:49,745 --> 03:09:50,946
NO INDIVIDUAL TO KEEP AND BEAR 

5553
03:09:50,946 --> 03:09:51,480
ARMS WHATSOEVER. 

5554
03:09:51,480 --> 03:09:52,280
THAT IT PROTECTS MERELY A 

5555
03:09:52,280 --> 03:09:53,081
COLLECTIVE RIGHT OF THE 

5556
03:09:53,081 --> 03:09:53,381
MILITIA. 

5557
03:09:53,381 --> 03:09:55,083
THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT RADICAL 

5558
03:09:55,083 --> 03:09:59,488
PROPOSITION WOULD MEAN THAT 

5559
03:09:59,488 --> 03:10:00,422
CONGRESS COULD PASS A LAW 

5560
03:10:00,422 --> 03:10:01,656
MAKING IT A FELONY, A CRIMINAL 

5561
03:10:01,656 --> 03:10:03,525
OFFENSE, FOR ANY AMERICAN TO 

5562
03:10:03,525 --> 03:10:06,027
OWN ANY FIREARM. 

5563
03:10:06,027 --> 03:10:07,762
AND NEITHER YOU NOR I NOR ANY 

5564
03:10:07,762 --> 03:10:08,329
AMERICAN WOULD HAVE ANY 

5565
03:10:08,329 --> 03:10:08,929
INDIVIDUAL RIGHT WHATSOEVER 

5566
03:10:08,929 --> 03:10:09,597
UNDER THE SECOND AMENDMENT. 

5567
03:10:09,597 --> 03:10:10,799
WOULD EFFECTIVELY ERASE THE 

5568
03:10:10,799 --> 03:10:12,367
SECOND AMENDMENT FROM THE BILL 

5569
03:10:12,367 --> 03:10:19,274
OF RIGHTS. 

5570
03:10:19,274 --> 03:10:20,008
THAT IS A BREATHTAKINGLY 

5571
03:10:20,008 --> 03:10:20,475
EXTREME PROPOSITION. 

5572
03:10:20,475 --> 03:10:21,109
WHAT HILLARY CLINTON PROMISED 

5573
03:10:21,109 --> 03:10:22,944
HER JUSTICES WOULD DO. 

5574
03:10:22,944 --> 03:10:24,579
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT 

5575
03:10:24,579 --> 03:10:31,586
IS WHAT THIS FIGHT IS ABOUT. 

5576
03:10:31,586 --> 03:10:32,487
WE KNOW THAT EVERY DEMOCRATIC 

5577
03:10:32,487 --> 03:10:33,522
MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE IS 

5578
03:10:33,522 --> 03:10:34,355
GOING TO VOTE NO. 

5579
03:10:34,355 --> 03:10:35,389
WE DON'T HAVE TO SPECULATE. 

5580
03:10:35,389 --> 03:10:36,591
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM IS 

5581
03:10:36,591 --> 03:10:37,959
PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED, THEY ARE 

5582
03:10:37,959 --> 03:10:39,227
VOTING NO. 

5583
03:10:39,227 --> 03:10:40,262
DOESN'T DEPEND ON WHAT THEY 

5584
03:10:40,262 --> 03:10:41,263
READ IN DOCUMENTS OR WHAT JUDGE 

5585
03:10:41,263 --> 03:10:42,497
KAVANAUGH SAYS AT THIS HEARING. 

5586
03:10:42,497 --> 03:10:43,931
THEY HAVE ANNOUNCED AHEAD OF 

5587
03:10:43,931 --> 03:10:48,970
TIME THEY ARE VOTING IN A. IN 

5588
03:10:48,970 --> 03:10:50,071
MOST OF THE DEMOCRATS IN THE 

5589
03:10:50,071 --> 03:10:51,072
SENATE HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT IN 

5590
03:10:51,072 --> 03:10:51,606
THE FULL SENATE. 

5591
03:10:51,606 --> 03:10:52,407
BUT EVERYONE SHOULD UNDERSTAND, 

5592
03:10:52,407 --> 03:10:53,441
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS HANDED OVER 

5593
03:10:53,441 --> 03:11:01,950
MORE DOCUMENTS THAN ANY NOMINEE 

5594
03:11:01,950 --> 03:11:03,351
. MORE THAN THE LAST FIVE 

5595
03:11:03,351 --> 03:11:03,618
COMBINED. 

5596
03:11:03,618 --> 03:11:04,151
REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT. 

5597
03:11:04,151 --> 03:11:05,220
IS NOT ABOUT DOCUMENTS, IT IS 

5598
03:11:05,220 --> 03:11:06,521
NOT ABOUT QUALIFICATION, IT IS 

5599
03:11:06,521 --> 03:11:07,689
NOT ABOUT RECORD, IT IS ABOUT 

5600
03:11:07,689 --> 03:11:07,956
POLITICS. 

5601
03:11:07,956 --> 03:11:08,690
IT IS ABOUT DEMOCRATIC SENATORS 

5602
03:11:08,690 --> 03:11:12,227
TRYING TO RELITIGATE THE 2016 

5603
03:11:12,227 --> 03:11:13,562
ELECTION AND JUST AS 

5604
03:11:13,562 --> 03:11:14,396
IMPORTANTLY, WORKING TO BEGIN 

5605
03:11:14,396 --> 03:11:15,330
LITIGATING THE 2020 

5606
03:11:15,330 --> 03:11:20,268
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. 

5607
03:11:20,268 --> 03:11:21,603
THAT WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY FOR 

5608
03:11:21,603 --> 03:11:22,571
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO SPEAK. 

5609
03:11:22,571 --> 03:11:23,905
THEY DID AND VOTED IN 2016 AND 

5610
03:11:23,905 --> 03:11:25,106
THEY WANTED JUDGES WHO WOULD BE 

5611
03:11:25,106 --> 03:11:26,541
FAITHFUL TO THE CONSTITUTION. 

5612
03:11:26,541 --> 03:11:30,912
THAT IS WHY I AM CONFIDENT THAT 

5613
03:11:30,912 --> 03:11:40,555
AT THE END OF WHAT SHAKESPEARE 

5614
03:11:40,555 --> 03:11:41,990
WOULD DESCRIBE AS A LOT OF 

5615
03:11:41,990 --> 03:11:42,624
SOUND AND FURY SIGNIFYING 

5616
03:11:42,624 --> 03:11:43,725
NOTHING, I AM CONFIDENT THAT 

5617
03:11:43,725 --> 03:11:44,626
JUDGE KAVANAUGH WILL BECOME 

5618
03:11:44,626 --> 03:11:45,460

30 MINUTES IS WHAT THE 

5628
03:12:01,676 --> 03:12:02,477
DEMOCRATS WOULD LIKE TO HAVE.
