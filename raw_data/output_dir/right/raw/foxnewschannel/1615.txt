00:00:29,906 --> 00:00:31,608
I SAILED 1400 MILES UP THE

17
00:00:31,608 --> 00:00:34,378

STATE CAPITAL.

26
00:00:59,937 --> 00:01:00,638
DOWN TO NEW YORK CITY.

27
00:01:00,638 --> 00:01:02,406
IT OPENED UP THE WHOLE COUNTRY,

28
00:01:02,406 --> 00:01:03,974
IT UNITED THE COUNTRY.

29
00:01:03,974 --> 00:01:09,246
IT USED TO TAKE 2 1/2 WEEKS TO

30
00:01:09,246 --> 00:01:10,714

THEY CUT TRAVEL TIME DOWN A

34
00:01:16,453 --> 00:01:18,055
THIRD, REDUCED COSTS MORE THAN A

35
00:01:18,055 --> 00:01:18,722
HALF.

36
00:01:18,722 --> 00:01:19,490
THIS MADE NEW YORK THE EMPIRE

37
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:19,923
STATE.

38
00:01:19,923 --> 00:01:22,459
THIS IS WHAT MADE NEW YORK CITY

39
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:23,527
THE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD.

40
00:01:23,527 --> 00:01:34,104
TO GO THROUGH THE ERIE CANAL, WE

41
00:01:34,238 --> 00:01:35,539
MONDAY AFTERNOON, SAILED UP TO

42
00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:39,009

43
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:40,477
THANKS TO THE CANAL AUTHORITIES

00:01:40,477 --> 00:01:42,046

AND I TRAVERSED THE ERIE CANAL.

48
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,321
WHAT IS REMARKABLE ABOUT THE

49
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:53,123
CANAL, IT HAS TO RAISE BOATS

50
00:01:53,123 --> 00:01:56,660
COMING FROM EAST TO WEST ALMOST

51
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,897
600 FEET BECAUSE THE LAKE ERIE

52
00:01:59,897 --> 00:02:01,465

53
00:02:01,465 --> 00:02:03,267

55
00:02:04,234 --> 00:02:05,069
SCHOOLCHILDREN CHEERING.

56
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:07,638

57
00:02:07,638 --> 00:02:12,976
UNITED STATES, CHARMINGVILLE --

00:02:16,947 --> 00:02:18,282
THOUGHTS ON NEWS OF THE DAY,

STORY YOU'RE PASSION THAT ABOUT.

63
00:02:20,417 --> 00:02:21,985
MEDIA CAUGHT PUSHING A FALSE

64
00:02:21,985 --> 00:02:22,352
NARRATIVE.

65
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:23,654
ABOUT A ROUNDTABLE THAT TOOK

66
00:02:23,654 --> 00:02:24,855
PLACE A COUPLE DAYS AGO IN THE

67
00:02:24,855 --> 00:02:26,090
WHITE HOUSE WHERE THE PRESIDENT

68
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,858
HAD MAYORS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT

69
00:02:27,858 --> 00:02:29,793
FROM CALIFORNIA TALKING ABOUT

70
00:02:29,793 --> 00:02:32,362
SANCTUARY CITIES AND IMMIGRATION

71
00:02:32,362 --> 00:02:32,763
LAWS.

72
00:02:32,763 --> 00:02:34,765
THE TRANSCRIPT CAME OUT AND

73
00:02:34,765 --> 00:02:36,500
JUMPED THE GUN, REFERRED TO

74
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,936
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AS ANIMALS,

75
00:02:38,936 --> 00:02:41,305
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT MS-13 GANG

76
00:02:41,305 --> 00:02:41,638
MEMBERS.

77
00:02:41,638 --> 00:02:42,740
A VERY BIG DIFFERENCE.

78
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,074
THEY JUMPED THE GUN.

79
00:02:44,074 --> 00:02:45,309
DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU?

80
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:47,010
>> YOU KNOW, WHAT HAPPENED,

81
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,313
ABBY, LET ME JUST QUICKLY TELL

82
00:02:49,313 --> 00:02:50,881
YOU WHAT I WENT THROUGH IN MY

83
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:51,682
OWN MIND.

84
00:02:51,682 --> 00:02:53,550
WHEN I FIRST, WE'RE ON THE BOAT,

85
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,319
WE'RE NOT WATCHING TELEVISION

86
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,854
NEWS OR ANYTHING, BUT I WAS

87
00:02:56,854 --> 00:02:58,222
LOOKING AT MY TWITTER FEED.

88
00:02:58,222 --> 00:03:00,858
I SAW THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD

89
00:03:00,858 --> 00:03:03,627
CALLED LATINO IMMIGRANTS

90
00:03:03,627 --> 00:03:03,961
SAVAGES.

91
00:03:03,961 --> 00:03:05,362
I SAID WHAT THE HELL?

92
00:03:05,362 --> 00:03:06,530
I'VE BEEN DEFENDING THE

93
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,865
PRESIDENT, MY FRIEND THE

94
00:03:07,865 --> 00:03:09,400
PRESIDENT SINCE 2015 AGAINST

95
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,902
CHARGES OF RACISM AND THAT

96
00:03:11,902 --> 00:03:13,537
REALLY, REALLY HURT MY FEELINGS.

97
00:03:13,537 --> 00:03:15,306
IT REALLY CUT ME TO THE QUICK

98
00:03:15,306 --> 00:03:16,440
WHEN I HEARD THAT.

99
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,375
THEN I SAW SOME OF THE WRITING,

100
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:21,011
SOME OF THE TWEETING THAT

101
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:22,580
DON, JR. DIDS THIS WAS IN

102
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,648
CONTEXT AS YOU SAID OF MS-13,

103
00:03:24,648 --> 00:03:27,084
THESE VICIOUS GANG BANGERS WHO

104
00:03:27,084 --> 00:03:28,252
DECAPITATE PEOPLE, CARVE THEM

105
00:03:28,252 --> 00:03:28,586
UP.

106
00:03:28,586 --> 00:03:30,521
THIS WAS NOT ABOUT IMMIGRANTS

107
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:31,455
GENERALLY.

108
00:03:31,455 --> 00:03:33,057
AND THEN I SPOKE TO SEAN HANNITY

109
00:03:33,057 --> 00:03:35,459
ABOUT IT, WE REALLY, REAL HEART

110
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:36,360
TO HEART.

111
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,395
I READ THE FULL CONTEXT OF THE

112
00:03:38,395 --> 00:03:38,729
REMARKS.

113
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:41,031
THERE IS NO DOUBT, THERE IS NO

114
00:03:41,031 --> 00:03:42,032
DOUBT WHATSOEVER THAT THE

115
00:03:42,032 --> 00:03:43,801
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

116
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:45,135
WAS SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO

117
00:03:45,135 --> 00:03:47,004
ONE OF THE MOST RUTHLESS AND

118
00:03:47,004 --> 00:03:48,639
VIOLENT CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS

119
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:53,677
IN THE COUNTRY, MS-13, THIS

120
00:03:53,677 --> 00:03:55,246
SALVADORAN-BASED GANG THAT IS A

121
00:03:55,246 --> 00:03:56,480
NATIONAL CRIMINAL SYNDICATE NOW.

122
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,115
SO ALTHOUGH I STILL CAUTION

123
00:03:58,115 --> 00:04:00,217
AGAINST USING WORDS LIKE SAVAGES

124
00:04:00,217 --> 00:04:01,986
AND ANIMALS, ANIMALS I SHOULD

125
00:04:01,986 --> 00:04:03,954
HAVE SAID THE PRESIDENT WAS

126
00:04:03,954 --> 00:04:06,390
SAYING AND THUGS, I THINK WHEN

127
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,259
THESE THINGS HAVE POSSIBLE

128
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:09,159
RACIAL CONNOTATION SHOULD

129
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:11,529
PROBABLY STAY AWAY FROM HOT

130
00:04:11,529 --> 00:04:12,763
BUTTON WORDS.

131
00:04:12,763 --> 00:04:14,598
THERE IS NO DOUBT -- I'M SORRY.

132
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:16,233
JUST GOING TO SAY NO DOUBT THE

133
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:17,935
PRESIDENT WAS NOT TALKING ABOUT

134
00:04:17,935 --> 00:04:19,136
IMMIGRANTS GENERALLY.

135
00:04:19,136 --> 00:04:21,639
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO

136
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,707
DESERVE THAT MONIKER.

137
00:04:22,707 --> 00:04:25,476
ABBY: I WAS GOING TO SAY TO YOUR

138
00:04:25,476 --> 00:04:27,812
POINT, WHY NOT READ THE FULL

139
00:04:27,812 --> 00:04:29,246
TRANSCRIPT TO MAKE SURE WHAT

140
00:04:29,246 --> 00:04:30,648
YOU'RE REPORT SOMETHING

141
00:04:30,648 --> 00:04:31,015
ACCURATE?

142
00:04:31,015 --> 00:04:32,817
WHY IS THE MEDIA SO QUICK TO

143
00:04:32,817 --> 00:04:33,117
JUMP.

144
00:04:33,117 --> 00:04:34,518
LOOK AT PRESIDENTS IN THE PAST

145
00:04:34,518 --> 00:04:36,487
WAY THEY ARE COVERED, SEEMS LIKE

146
00:04:36,487 --> 00:04:38,656
A HOT QUICKER TO JUMP ON

147
00:04:38,656 --> 00:04:39,890
PRESIDENT TRUMP THAN THEY ARE ON

148
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:40,758
PRESIDENTS BEFORE THIS?

149
00:04:40,758 --> 00:04:42,493
>> THERE IS NO DOUBT, THIS

150
00:04:42,493 --> 00:04:43,461
PRESIDENT, MAYBE WITH THE

151
00:04:43,461 --> 00:04:45,596
POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF

152
00:04:45,596 --> 00:04:47,465
RICHARD NIXON OR ANDREW JOHNSON

153
00:04:47,465 --> 00:04:48,933
IN 19th CENTURY, THIS

154
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:51,268
PRESIDENT GETS THE WORSE PRESS

155
00:04:51,268 --> 00:04:53,270
OF ANY PUBLIC OFFICIAL I HAVE

156
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,838
EVER KNOWN.

157
00:04:53,838 --> 00:04:55,005
EVERYTHING HE SAYS, THIS IS

158
00:04:55,005 --> 00:04:57,575
CLASSIC EXAMPLE, ABBY,

159
00:04:57,575 --> 00:04:59,844
EVERYTHING HE SAID IS CONSTRUED

160
00:04:59,844 --> 00:05:01,545
IN MOST EVIL WAY POSSIBLE.

161
00:05:01,545 --> 00:05:02,947
EVEN DONALD TRUMP DESERVES

162
00:05:02,947 --> 00:05:05,683
FAIRNESS FROM YOU PEOPLE.

163
00:05:05,683 --> 00:05:08,653
AND, IT IS DIVISIVE FOR THE

164
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:10,621
COUNTRY IT MISCONSTRUE HIS

165
00:05:10,621 --> 00:05:11,889
REMARKS INTENTIONALLY BECAUSE

166
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:13,624
ANY, ANY PERSON WITH HALF A

167
00:05:13,624 --> 00:05:19,597
BRAIN READING THE FULL PARAGRAPH

168
00:05:19,597 --> 00:05:20,998
RATHER THAN INFLAMMATORY

169
00:05:20,998 --> 00:05:22,033
SENTENCE THAN EVERYBODY

170
00:05:22,033 --> 00:05:22,400
BROADCAST.

171
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,268
SEE THE MESSAGE HE WAS TRYING TO

172
00:05:24,268 --> 00:05:24,602
CONVEY.

173
00:05:24,602 --> 00:05:26,137
HE WAS SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY OF

174
00:05:26,137 --> 00:05:27,538
PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO RIGHT TO BE

175
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:29,941
IN THIS COUNTRY.

176
00:05:29,941 --> 00:05:30,975
MOREOVER, ONCE THEY'RE HERE THEY

177
00:05:30,975 --> 00:05:32,510
ARE DOING THE WORST POSSIBLE

178
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,377
THINGS POSSIBLE.

179
00:05:33,377 --> 00:05:35,413
THEY DO NOT REFLECT, I MAINTAIN,

180
00:05:35,413 --> 00:05:40,217
AND I WILL GO TO MY GRAVE SAYING

181
00:05:40,217 --> 00:05:42,086
THEY DO NOT REFLECT THE

182
00:05:42,086 --> 00:05:43,187
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY GENERALLY.

183
00:05:43,187 --> 00:05:44,889
NO DOUBT THESE ARE VERY BAD

184
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:45,222
ACTORS.

185
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:46,290
THE PRESIDENT WAS RIGHT TO CALL

186
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,593
THEM OUT AND TO ANNOUNCE HIS

187
00:05:48,593 --> 00:05:50,695
PRIORITY TO PURGE MS-13 FROM THE

188
00:05:50,695 --> 00:05:51,429
UNITED STATES.

189
00:05:51,429 --> 00:05:52,263
BACK TO YOU GUYS.

190
00:05:52,263 --> 00:05:52,964
STEVE: THAT'S RIGHT.

00:05:55,299 --> 00:05:56,667

00:06:03,808 --> 00:06:05,676

198
00:06:05,676 --> 00:06:08,179

199
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:10,982
>> YOU KNOW WHY, STEVE?

200
00:06:10,982 --> 00:06:15,153
IT IS BECAUSE SPECIFICALLY

201
00:06:15,153 --> 00:06:16,020
