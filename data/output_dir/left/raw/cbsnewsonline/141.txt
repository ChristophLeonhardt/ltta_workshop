THE CUTTING OF REGULATIONS

NIGHT AND DAY TO SCORE THIS 

120
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:52,792
LANDMARK VICTORY. 

121
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,427
FOR THEIR CONSTITUENTS BUT MUCH 

122
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,562
MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR THE 

123
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:56,896
COUNTRY. 

124
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:57,463
UNFORTUNATELY EVERY SINGLE 

125
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,599
DEMOCRAT IN THE HOUSE AND 

126
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,802
SENATE, THAT'S RIGHT, EVERY 

127
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,270
SINGLE ONE VOTED AGAINST LOWER 

128
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,805

00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:09,342
AMERICANS AND YOU SEE WHAT'S 

130
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:09,609
HAPPENED. 

131
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:12,478
IT'S TURNED OUT TO BE SOMETHING 

132
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:12,811
VERY SPECIAL. 

133
00:05:12,811 --> 00:05:16,949
THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT 

134
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:20,353
SLASHED INCOME TAXES ALL ACROSS 

135
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:20,653
THE BOARD. 

136
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,523
WE NEARLY DOUBLED THE STANDARD 

137
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:26,993
DEDUCTION AND DID DOUBLE THE 

138
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:27,593
CHILD TAX CREDIT WHICH IVANKA 

139
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:33,232
WANTED VERY MUCH I WILL TELL 

140
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:37,036

141
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:37,903
STAND UP IVANKA. 

142
00:05:37,903 --> 00:05:38,270
STAND UP HONEY. 

143
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,572
[APPLAUSE]

144
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:46,779
>> SHE I DO NOT TELL A BIGGER 

145
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,047
HAND THAN THE POLITICIANS. 

146
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,348
THAT MEANS YOU ARE ALL IN 

147
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:49,982
TROUBLE. 

148
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:52,985
THE TYPICAL FAMILY OF FOUR 

149
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:53,552
EARNING $75,000 WILL SEE AN 

150
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:56,122
INCOME TAX CUT OF MORE THAN 

151
00:05:56,122 --> 00:06:00,493
$2,000 AND IN SOME CASES MORE. 

152
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:01,561
SLASHING THEIR TAX BILL IN 

153
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:01,861
HALF. 

154
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,095
WE CUT TAXES FOR BUSINESSES OF 

155
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:05,765
ALL SIZES TO MAKE THIS THE BEST 

156
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:08,701
PLACE ON EARTH TO START A 

157
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,603
BUSINESS TO I AM VEST. 

158
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:11,236
WE HAVE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS 

159
00:06:11,236 --> 00:06:14,307
OF DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL 

160
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:14,907
REVENUE COMING IN. 

161
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:15,507
WE LOWERED THE CORPORATE TAX 

162
00:06:15,507 --> 00:06:17,076
RATE SO THE AMERICAN WORKER 

163
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:20,079
FINALLY HAS A LEVEL PLAYING 

164
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:20,312
FIELD. 

165
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:23,549
WE ALLOWED COMPANIES TO DEDUCT 

166
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,550
EVERY SINGLE PENNY OF 

167
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,820
INVESTMENT IN NEW EQUIPMENT AND 

168
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,888
IT'S CALLED EXPENSING. 

169
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,189
IT'S THE BIGGEST SECRET IN THE 

170
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:30,389
PLAN. 

171
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,058
I THINK IT WILL GO DOWN AS 

172
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,493
MAYBE THE MOST IMPORTANT 

173
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:34,760
ELEMENT. 

174
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,962
IT'S ONE YEAR EXPENSING NOBODY 

175
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,529
THOUGHT WE WOULD EVER SEE THAT. 

176
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:40,633
SO INCREDIBLE FOR STARTING UP A 

177
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:41,401
BUSINESS OR RUNNING A BUSINESS. 

178
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:45,571
WE GREATLY REDUCE THE BURDEN OF 

179
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,174
THE UNFAIR ESTATE TAX COMMONLY 

180
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,109
KNOWN AS THE DEATH TAX. 

181
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,211
YOU KNOW, THAT'S SUCH A BIG 

182
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,479
THING AND MOST FARMS AND MOST 

183
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:58,351
SMALL BUSINESS WILL NOT PAY ANY 

184
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:02,855
STATE TAX OR DEATH TAX. 

185
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,658
SUCH A BIG THING. 

186
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:06,125
[APPLAUSE] 

187
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,426
WE CREATED OPPORTUNITY ZONES TO 

188
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:15,167
PROMOTE MORE JOBS IN LOW INCOME 

189
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:15,835
COMMUNITIES. 

190
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:19,138
WE OPENED ANNURE. 

191
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:19,705
THAT'S A BIG ONE. 

192
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:20,005
[APPLAUSE] 

193
00:07:20,005 --> 00:07:21,473
NAH WAS ONE THAT THEY SAID NO 

194
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:24,443
PRESIDENT COULD GET IT FOR MANY 

195
00:07:24,443 --> 00:07:24,676
YEARS. 

196
00:07:24,676 --> 00:07:25,310
I WASN'T GOING TO DO IT BECAUSE 

197
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,212
I WAS ANGRY AT SOMEONE. 

198
00:07:27,212 --> 00:07:29,148
I SAID I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT 

199
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,183
AND THEN WHEN I HEARD THAT 

200
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:32,618
RONALD REAGAN COULDN'T DO IT, 

201
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,654
NOBODY COULD DO IT, THEY HAVE 

202
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,722
BEEN TRYING FOR 50 YEARS I SAID 

203
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:40,426
OH LET'S DO THAT IMMEDIATELY. 

204
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:46,532
IT'S LIKE A CHALLENGE, RIGHT? 

205
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:47,166
A CHALLENGE. 

206
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:47,466
[APPLAUSE] 

207
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:48,000
AND THEY'VE STARTED THAT 

208
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,267
PROCESS. 

209
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,068
IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING ONE 

210
00:07:50,068 --> 00:07:54,206
MUCH THE BIGGEST IN THE WORLD. 

211
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:56,208
PLAN WE REPEALED THE MOST I 

212
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:59,278
GUESS YOU COULD SAY UNPOPULAR 

213
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:01,714
THING I'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME 

214
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:09,255
IN POLITICS OR LEGISLATION, THE 

215
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:12,591
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE ON OBAMACARE.

216
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:12,891
[APPLAUSE] 

217
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:13,525
>> THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, HOW 

218
00:08:13,525 --> 00:08:16,195
ABOUT THAT ONE. 

219
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:20,766
THAT'S WHERE YOU HAVE THE RIDGE 

220
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:21,734
OF PAYING A FORTUNE IN ORDER TO 

221
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,337
NOT PAY TO HAVE BAD HEALTHCARE. 

222
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:24,904
THINK OF THAT. 

223
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,340
IN OTHER WORDS YOU PAY A LOT OF 

224
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,775
MONEY NOT TO HAVE HEALTHCARE SO 

225
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:30,543
IT'S NOT LOOKING TOO GOOD. 

226
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:38,015
WE'VE GOT NO CREDIT BUT THAT'S 

227
00:08:38,015 --> 00:08:38,216
OKAY. 

228
00:08:38,216 --> 00:08:39,952
SOME PEOPLE COME UP TO ME AND 

229
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:43,856
SAY THEY LIKE THAT AS MUCH AS 

230
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:44,123
TAX CUTS. 

231
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:44,590
THAT'S A BIG THING. 

232
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,158
AND OBAMACARE IS JUST ABOUT 

233
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:46,391
OVER. 

234
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:48,394
WE HAVE COME UP WITH SO MANY 

235
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:52,965
PLANS AND WE HAVE A PLAN COMING 

236
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:54,533
OUT AN ADDITIONAL PLAN, 

237
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:55,167
SECRETARY COMING OUT IN A VERY 

238
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:55,902
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WHICH IS 

239
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,170
GOING TO BE--I THINK IT'S GOING 

240
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,172
TO PERHAPS MATCH YOUR PLAN FROM 

241
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:00,772
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. 

242
00:09:00,772 --> 00:09:08,247
IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING VERY 

243
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:08,514
SPECIAL. 

244
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:09,114
SIX MONTHS AFTER OUR TAX CUTS 

245
00:09:09,114 --> 00:09:12,818
MORE THAN 6 MILLION WORKERS 

246
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:17,557
HAVE RECEIVED BONUSES AND REAT 

247
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,757
ANOTHER TIME ACCOUNT 

248
00:09:18,757 --> 00:09:19,792
CONTRIBUTION. 

249
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:20,325
AND ONE OF THE BEAUTIFUL 

250
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:23,362
ELEMENTS OF WHAT I DO, I LOVE 

251
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,296
TO SEE HAPPY FACES BUT I'LL 

252
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:26,932
STAND ON THE LINE SOMETIMES 

253
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:27,533
BEFORE OR AFTER A SPEECH AND 

254
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,268
I'LL BE WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE 

255
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:30,703
THAT WANT PICTURES FOR WHATEVER 

256
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,805
REASON THEY WANT A PICTURE OF 

257
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,541
ME AND I STAND WITH THE POLICE 

258
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,376
A LOT AND I'LL SEE A POLICE MAN 

259
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:41,480
AND IN PARTICULAR ONE IN NEW 

260
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:47,053
YORK CITY AND HE SAYS SIR I 

261
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:47,486
WANT TO THANK YOU. 

262
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:48,154
YOU MADE ME A HERO TO MY WIFE 

263
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:53,793
AND FAMILY BUT THIS YEAR MY 

264
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,895
401K IS UP LIKE 46%. 

265
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,530
MY WIFE THINKS I'M A GENIUS. 

266
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,233
SHE THINKS I'M THE GREATEST 

267
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:04,035
INVESTOR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 

268
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:04,302
MY LIFE. 

269
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:04,603
[APPLAUSE] 

270
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:07,973
>> AND YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF 

271
00:10:07,973 --> 00:10:09,508
VALUE OR WORTH WE HAVE CREATED 

272
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:12,078
SEVEN STRONG DOLLARS WORTH OF 

273
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,714
VALUE FOR OUR COUNTRY AND 

274
00:10:15,714 --> 00:10:19,885
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS. 

275
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:22,921
WE ARE ALMOST DOUBLE THE SIZE. 

276
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:23,355
CHINA IS TERRIFIC. 

277
00:10:23,355 --> 00:10:23,989
WE ARE STRAIGHTENING OUT THE 

278
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:28,227
BALANCE AND I THINK MOST PEOPLE 

279
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,730
WANT TO SEE THAT. 

280
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,330
BUT WE'RE THE LARGEST ECONOMY 

281
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,865
IN THE WORLD BY FAR AND AS YOU 

282
00:10:33,865 --> 00:10:36,435
KNOW WE'VE INCREASED A LOT OVER 

283
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:39,538
THE LAST ONE AND A HALF YEARS 

284
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,240
BUT WE ARE ALMOST DOUBLE THE 

285
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,508
SIZE OF CHINA AND FAR BIGGER 

286
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:44,710
THAN ANYBODY ELSE AND WE ARE 

287
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,978
GOING UP VERY RAPIDLY AND IT'S 

288
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:49,515
GOING TO CONTINUE TO GO UP VERY 

289
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:49,982
RAPIDLY. 

290
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,884
BIGGEST IN THE WORLD BY FAR. 

291
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:52,751
THINK OF THAT. 

292
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:53,519
WE ARE THE BIGGEST--DID YOU 

293
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:53,819
KNOW THAT? 

294
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,555
THE BIGGEST ECONOMY IN THE 

295
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:56,888
WORLD BY FAR. 

296
00:10:56,888 --> 00:11:03,262
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT, 

297
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:04,964
RIGHT? 

298
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,832
IT REALLY IS. 

299
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:07,766
IT'S PRETTY GOOD. 

300
00:11:07,766 --> 00:11:11,370
AND THEY HELPED US A LITTLE BIT 

301
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,238
BUT EVERY LITTLE BIT COULD YOU 

302
00:11:13,238 --> 00:11:13,538
UNDERSTAND. 

303
00:11:13,538 --> 00:11:15,808
SO THE SHARE OF SMALL 

304
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:16,742
BUSINESSES RAISING BENEFITS AND 

305
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:20,346
PAY HAS JUST SET A NEW ALL TIME 

306
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,213
RECORD AND MANUFACTURING 

307
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,715
OPTIMISM TO ME IS SO IMPORTANT 

308
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:28,287
BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT OPTIMISM 

309
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:32,625
IS THE HIGHEST EVER RECORDED. 

310
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,694
THIS IS A STATISTIC THAT'S BEEN 

311
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:36,962
AROUND FOR A LONG TIME HIGHEST 

312
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:37,897
EVER REPORTED HUNDREDS OF 

313
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:41,199
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COMING BACK 

314
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:42,735
FROM OVER SEAS. 

315
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:46,705
OVER $300 BILLION WAS JUST 

316
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:49,108
REPATE RATED INTO OUR COUNTRY 

317
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,811
IN THE FIRST QUARTER ALONE. 

318
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,044
THINK OF THAT, 300 MILLION. 

319
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:56,415
MONEY WE NEVER WOULD HAVE SEEN. 

320
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:57,116
TRILLIONS MORE DOLLARS ARE ON 

321
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:01,053
THEIR WAY BACK AND APPLE 

322
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,622
ANNOUNCED THEY ARE GOING TO 

323
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:04,155
SPEND $350 BILLION. 

324
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:04,489
NOT MILLION. 

325
00:12:04,489 --> 00:12:07,192
I WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY WITH 

326
00:12:07,192 --> 00:12:09,895
THAT TOO BUT $350 BILLION IS 

327
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,197
BEING BROUGHT BACK. 

328
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,699
I GUESS THE TOTAL AMOUNT THEY 

329
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:14,600
ARE BRINGING BACK IS 

330
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,234
APPROXIMATELY $230 BILLION AND 

331
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,568
THEY ARE PUTTING UP THE REST 

332
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:17,569
THE OLD FASHION WAY. 

333
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:19,738
THEY ARE BRINGING THIS MONEY 

334
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:20,005
BACK. 

335
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,206
IT WOULD NEVER HAVE COME BACK. 

336
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:23,943
THEY ARE GOING TO BUILD AN 

337
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,411
INCREDIBLE CAMPUS AND LOTS OF 

338
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:25,744
OTHER THINGS. 

339
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,179
WE JUST LEFT WISCONSIN AND WHAT 

340
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,048
IS BUILDING UP IN WISCONSIN IS 

341
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,884
LITERALLY AND I SAID IT THE 8 

342
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:32,651
8th WONDER OF THE WORLD. 

343
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:35,453
IT'S INCREDIBLE WHAT THEY ARE 

344
00:12:35,453 --> 00:12:36,021
DOING. 

345
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,122
15,000 JOBS GOING TO COST $15 

346
00:12:37,122 --> 00:12:37,590
BILLION. 

347
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,992
IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS SO 

348
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:40,826
INCREDIBLE YOU HAVE TO GO SEE 

349
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:41,060
IT. 

350
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,196
NOBODY WOULD BELIEVE WHAT IS 

351
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:44,730
HAPPENING. 

352
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:45,998
MORE NAN 100 UTILITY COMPANIES 

353
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,933
HAVE LOWERED PRICES AS A DIRECT 

354
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,570
RESULT OF OUR BUSINESS TAX CUTS 

355
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,571
SAVING AMERICANS $3 BILLION ON 

356
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:53,705
THEIR UTILITY BILLS. 

357
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:57,710
UTILITY BILLS ARE GOING DOWN. 

358
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,946
UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS ARE AT A 44 

359
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,349
YEAR LOW. 

360
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:07,987
THAT'S A GOOD ONE. 

361
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:08,254
44 YEARS. 

362
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:12,257
[APPLAUSE] 

363
00:13:12,257 --> 00:13:14,260
SOMETHING I AM SO PROUD OF. 

364
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,061
I LOVE IT. 

365
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:17,062
UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT THE LOWEST 

366
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:28,274
LEVEL IN THE HISTORY OF OUR 

367
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,041
COUNTRY FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS 

368

[APPLAUSE] 

369
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,913
I'M LOOKK AT KEVIN. 

370
00:13:34,913 --> 00:13:36,382
THAT WAS A GOOD JOB. 

371
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:36,815
WE WERE ALL RIGHT. 

372
