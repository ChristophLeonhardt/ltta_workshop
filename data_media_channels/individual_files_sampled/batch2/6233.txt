people are dying taking selfies of themselves 259 people that are at least all on the record as having died while taking selfies in the past seven years alone the numbers are almost certainly higher but these are ones that have been verified as having happened while taking selfies the most selfie deaths occurred in India followed by Russia the US and Pakistan some of that is going to come down to population I'm sure but yes most of the victims were men I've had 72% who is shocked by that and under the age of 30 not a lot of senior citizens dying while taking selfies India had 159 of those 259 that is Terrence a big country it is a huge population you know it's like three times because US it's pretty big I mean 200 million I think I'm not sure don't quote me I think it's more than 200 million um but anyway men and young are you shocked no no no I mean I just think imagining like dudes like check out this like doodoo selfie while doing keg stand and then like just like falling and you know cracking yeah and by the way it's even worse that because women of course in terms of numbers do take more selfies so right they're more practice yes more practice so they know the dangers they know how dangerous it is you don't do it in an oven you don't do it on a cliff I mean it's just it just supports that women are not as dangerous as a man like we just were just now rectly or could not it you know we're not you know we're not prone to be as reckless and especially in that age range of young men you know the guys that that like beer that say mantras you know like that those are the people that do stuff like this and and and that's that's what we talk about when we talk about toxic masculinity like look it's here yeah yeah and by the way it's I guess sort of dark but not far from where we're filming this there was a great tragedy not that many years ago a youtuber I was trying to film a short video on like right next to train tracks and died like pretty close actually here and look it's a combination of recklessness and risk-taking which is common in youth but now there's so much incentive to do something that stands out yep and it is actually killing people you know I used to live in China and I'm surprised the numbers in China and higher but I suspect I success because these they use a selfie stick probably safer mm-hmm with the stick then doing it just with your hand yeah good escape okay see a more range of vision exactly so how are people actually dying well drowning is the leading cause of selfie deaths I know usually involving people being washed away by waves or beaches are falling out of a boat I'm gonna guess that the boat thing is probably a big part of that yeah did you see that video when the lion that what they were on the safari in the lion unlocked the door and got in the car no I it went viral it was a video this big old lion gets in the car and the girl in the back she can take a selfie with lion was huge and so big and that girl wanted to take a picture with the llama well but she didn't die no gentlemen although death by lion into the top ten for self if it was if it would've been a guy by the way the second most common cause was transport this is like people taking a picture in front of a wheelie or something yeah that too don't don't say in front of a moving train trains are dangerous tied for third are fires and falls from high places I don't know how that's the Russians do that the Russians do it's big a YouTube thing in Russia where they like go up they go up like a building or like a scaffold or something and like they'll take a picture and they're just like hanging off like on the edge of the things some of those are terrifying yeah they're higher than anything should be don't build the building that high less people people will stop dying from selfies if you stop building a building so there was a I think it might have been in Dubai there was a couple who likes to do shots that are really dramatic and so he super high up held the woman out of a window and she felt death absolutely tragic eight people died by the way while taking selfies with dangerous animals although not that woman with the lion at least but you might be wondering Russia and India and Pakistan getting all this credit what about us well the us-led in the number of selfie deaths involving a firearm people accidentally shooting everyone is shocked to find out we just seem to lead the world and anything that has to do with gun yeah yeah people love it I get that look posing with a gun might seem cool I will admit growing up my father actually owned quite a few guns I have posed a buddy when I was much younger with guns because I thought it looked was it a selfie it was not a selfie right you survived the selfie I also I did an important thing that I would advise you do is you're gonna pose with a gun don't point it yourself or someone else just good that's a good that's a good tip and you can use it could be unloaded and they won't know so look I don't want to exaggerate too much about the selfies like 259 is terrible that is a tragedy but it's not like you know it's not one of the leading causes of death I am more worried about texting while driving I've treated recently about my frustration with it recently I was in my car I pull up to a stop there's a woman in the car and she's texting she's got kid in the back and like as the traffic starts to go she she's seeing it she's moving but she's still looking at the phone and I'm sure you see it when you when you look around and obviously look this is not killing 2 percent of all of us it's not the worst thing in the world but there's all of these incentives to stay tuned in to try to get the followers and the likes and all of that by doing these these crazy stunts and everything and I wonder how quickly as a species we will adapt to it socially I mean I think there's no way that they're gonna sort of do anything to curb it you think yeah I mean I've talked occasionally I haven't like really formalized it but I remember reading about the early attempts to stop drunk driving and how socially unpopular it was to say don't drink and drive because that's just what people did but you had to take it serious so you had to have actual jail time is that crazy to say if you caught texting while driving you get thrown in jail at least briefly it's a fine this is one of those things that is hard for progressives right because we need to stop the carceral state and yes anything be unjust with all these acutely black people going to jail would like so that's always tough I'm always I'm always really hesitate to apply carceral Adrienne's too because I just know that like the bread Cavanaugh's of the world I'm never gonna text away and they're not gonna end and then it's really just a poor black kids who get sent to jail for that so I don't know I think self-driving cars two easy ways for Young Turks want us hit
