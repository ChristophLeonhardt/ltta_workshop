so now that the Republican version of health care has failed of course they can't take responsibility what are they gonna do they're gonna blame the Democrats now wait a minute Democrats are not in control of the house or the Senate or the White House how are they at fault let's find out first Donald Trump tweets we were let down by all the Democrats and a few Republicans most Republicans were loyal and terrific and work really hard we will return he's he's saying that Peyer will strike back we'll see about that but there you see a shot at the Democrats you'll see more in a second but Mitch McConnell joys of fun says even though we're completely in charge it was somehow the Democrats fault let's listen I regret that the effort to repeal and immediately replace the failures of Obamacare will not be successful that doesn't mean we should give up in the coming days the Senate will take up and vote on a repeal of Obamacare combined with a stable two-year transition period as we work toward patient-centered health care a majority of the Senate voted to pass the same repeal legislation back in 2015 President Obama vetoed it then President Tom Trump President Trump will sign and now I imagine many Democrats were celebrating last night I hope they consider what they are celebrating the American people are hurting they need relief and it's regretful that our Democratic colleagues decided early on that they did not want to engage with us seriously in the process to deliver that relief our Democratic friends have spoken a lot recently about wanting bipartisan solutions passing this legislation will provide the opportunity for senators of all parties to engage with a fresh start and a new beginning for the American people this guy's a joke man so let me begin to shred this talking point first of all he says well our friends who wanted a bipartisan solution so vote for this bill but this bill isn't a bipartisan solution this bill is crafted only by Republicans in fact McConnell's office did it in secret a lot of the Republican senators didn't have access to it until it was released to the public so what's the part where that you guys work together you didn't work together at all you didn't offer any fig leaf you didn't offer one compromise to the Democrats it is a completely Republican plan and it is a miserable one that the American people hate it pulls a 24% popularity and then you turn around go I got a great bipartisan solution why don't you just vote for our bill Oh Mitch what would your bill do oh it would destroy your plan you remember how you guys spend all that time passing Obamacare this would murder it wow what a bipartisan offer really appreciate it Mitch thanks a lot Mitch but we're not done I'm gonna shred it more in a second but first let's watch Donald Trump do the same thing but if you really think about it you look at it and we have 52 people we had no democrat support which is really you know something that should be said we should have had Democrats voted is a great plan for a lot of people we had no Democrat support so the way I look at it is in 18 we're gonna have to get some more people elected we have to go out and we have to get more people elected than a Republican we we want we want I think we're gonna do very well actually in 18 it would be nice to have Democrat support but really they're obstructionists they have no ideas they thought process all they want to do is obstruct the government and obstruct period well actually they had one idea it was called Obamacare see that was their plan and they passed it now you're trying to destroy their plan why would they help you of course they're gonna obstruct that it's like saying well I was look I was planning on passing a bill that would allow me to punch Democrats in the face they will block it can you believe they kept blocking the bill that would let me punch them right in the nose I can't believe it how come they didn't help me to break their nose I don't know really you're that dumb is out yeah I mean really I mean look if you're a Republican what are your two choices here either he's being wildly disingenuous or he's just the dumbest guy alive I mean why would the Democrats help you destroy the Democratic plan for health care why would they give you a single to do that and the only people in the country that's entertaining the dumbass talking point in the history of of talking points is the media that are like oh wow that's an interesting point well now let's have an eight-person panel debate whether the democrats should have helped republicans destroy the democratic idea for healthcare come on man we're wasting time discussing this like that's a real idea harsher today is it the Democrats fault well let's call fifty-fifty and be done with it no no should a Democrat celebrate today of course of course they should celebrate the Republican plan was monstrous it would have kicked at least 22 million people off of health care the Democrats did not have any input into the building we're not allowed in the drafting room they were not allowed any amendments they were not allowed to have any voice in the process at all and and yes I think they should have a constructive solution it's Medicare for all most of the Democrats in the House agree to that if if the Republicans would like a bipartisan solution and move on to Medicare for all which by the way is pulling at fifty eight percent better than Obama care which is pulling at 50 percent and way better than the Republican proposal pulling at twenty four percent so you want to do it you want to do a popular plan by the way what is Medicare for I'll do it would cover everyone Medicare has lower cost and covers more than private insurance oh look the three things that the Republicans promised when they were lying to you during the campaign you want to do that deal oh you don't do you instead you want to cut Medicare cut Medicaid and just give tax cuts to the rich you want a bipartisan solution it exists but to ask the Democrats to take down what currently exists that they had they passed with blood sweat and tears is so stupid and ridiculous that I can't believe any person who calls himself a journalist would entertain that talking point for a second if you see anyone legitimately debating it on TV then you know that they are not real reporters all they're doing is playing he says she said neutrality games that are not connected to reality at all if you liked this video you love the whole TYT Network check it out at TYT Network comm slash
