way lieutenant we've been waiting for an
hour for fuck's sake Jesus Christ so
sweat okay uh recorder a lot of people
on the crime scene aren't you afraid
your men might destroy some clues you
don't find proof sitting behind a desk
I'm having a trample on things into the
ground we're not any FBI oh my goodness
can I go investigate it no of course not
that it's not running then why is this
kind of just walking around like an
idiot I'm only holding I don't want to

see me if you find anything yeah I'm the
same team now
yeah hahaha I like that guy he seems
like an asshole okay let's get my
glasses back okay now we're gonna do
some FBI investigation shit okay me
metalli investigation okay the first
thing I think we should do is check out
the body oh my god cannon victims lying
on his back no visible signs of violence
no visible signs of violence how did he
die they
whoa that's insane his face is covered
with man
his face is covered with mud oh my
goodness this poor kid in the orchid was
placed on the victims chest and all kid
was placed on the victims chest okay was
this his pockets his hand a small
origami figure in the right hand fingers
were probably closed after the time of
death oh my girls are so sad
the victim is Jeremy balls check her
missing five days ago see reference fire
wall last clue what is that seam it's
superficial wound on the right thigh
blood analysis suggests it could be
postmortem
probably a scratch that occurred when
the value as we move the blood report
indicates an advanced and long-lasting
state of exhaustion a long-lasting state
of an exhaustion I think I said all that
poor kid that I'm not even going to show
him
oh man that's sad okay I guess we should
look for clues what's this what is this
porcupine I detected well our
pollen from the flower that was left on
the body oh my goodness is like there's
like us like a sin oh my goodness pollen
particles disappear in the tall grass
it's probably the end of the trail okay
what's this blood carry cannon traces of
blood on the railroad track whoa
analysis confirms it comes from the
victim
oh okay and it seems to be leading over
here what is this
footprints footprints continue just
after the palm tree whoa there's a good
chance about the killer's we have the
killer's footprints that's insane okay
and it leads up to up here what's it
doing up here what is that
traces of blood
the fence behind the victim the killer
came this way with the body and probably
grazed it on his way through the fence
whoa the killer came from up here are we
gonna go up here on the goose this looks
pretty steep oh shit oh shit a more
muddy
I know James I'm sorry okay go on Norman
all right circle triangle um don't mess

this tire tracks
tire tracks on the side of the boat
we have that we have the vehicle it may
be the killer's car yeah we have the
killer's car scene all there is to see

copied and they got a note under dog
collar results of your MRI scans and my
writing seems to be normal
there is no physical damage from the
accident whoa however I am worried about
your psychological condition you are I
know it's not easy but you've got to
start over Ethan you're not responsible
for what happened on it's my fault Jason

looking out for him oh it was an
accident

blame yourself forever for your son's
death oh this is sad how is Sean I was

sorry I'm not the father I used to be
he's a great kid you know he deserves
better and what about you Ethan what do
you feel I do I feel uh dead oh my
goodness should I say dead I stopped
living at the same time Jason did Oh
when that car ran into us

tell me Ethan whoa oh yeah the
flashbacks the blackouts uh yeah the
black house
I sometimes have these blackouts times
when I don't know what I'm doing
I recover consciousness sometime later
but I'm someplace else
and I have no idea how I got there
yeah dude why do you think this could be
related to the accident

we're in a coma for six months I was in
a coma versus agreement no what effect a
shock like that can have on the brain
