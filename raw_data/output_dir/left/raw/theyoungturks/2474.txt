1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,080
AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN UTAH
IS CATCHING A LITTLE BIT OF HEAT

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,180
BECAUSE OF A POLICY THAT THEY
HAD FOR THEIR ST.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,180
VALENTINE'S

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,099
DAY DANCE.

5
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:14,090
THE SCHOOL
ADMINISTRATORS BELIEVE THAT IT

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,660
WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO LET THE
FEMALES IN THE SCHOOL KNOW THAT

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,440
THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SAY NO
TO THE BOYS WHO ASK THEM TO

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,359
DANCE AND ONE OF THE PARENTS WAS
JUSTIFIABLY OUTRAGED BY THIS.

9
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:38,399
WHEN NATALIE RICHARDS REACHED
OUT TO 

10
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,159
THE PRINCIPAL:

11
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:45,489
SHE ALSO SAID:

12
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:52,329
OKAY, SO BASICALLY THESE LITTLE
GIRLS ARE NOT ALLOWED, BASED ON

13
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:55,679
THIS GROWTH POLICY, NOT ALLOWED
TO SAY NO WHEN A BOY ASKS HER TO

14
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,499
DANCE BECAUSE THE FEELINGS FOR
THE LITTLE BOYS TEND TO BE A

15
00:01:00,499 --> 00:01:03,600
LITTLE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE
FEELINGS THAT THE LITTLE GIRLS

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,599
HAVE.

17
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,960
THIS IS SUCH A BAD IDEA
AND I AM GLAD THAT THE PARENT

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,549
HERE CALLED THEM OUT ON IT.

19
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:10,780
I
DO NOT KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THEY

20
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,950
ARE PLANNING ON CHANGING THE
POLICY BUT IT SENDS A REALLY BAD

21
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,299
MESSAGE BECAUSE ONE OF THE
BIGGEST ISSUES THAT WE ARE

22
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:19,820
SEEING WITH THIS ME TO MOVEMENT
IS THE FACT THAT THE MEN

23
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,210
WHO ARE BEING ACCUSED OF
PREDATORY BEHAVIOR OR ANY

24
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,799
TYPE OF MISCONDUCT HAD A SENSE
OF ENTITLEMENT AND I THINK

25
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,679
THAT IT IS SOCIETAL
CONDITIONING.

26
00:01:28,679 --> 00:01:31,399
IT IS THE TYPE OF CULTURE THAT
WE'VE HAD IN THE UNITED

27
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:34,659
STATES FOR A LONG TIME WHEN MEN
HAVE BEEN TOLD TIME AND TIME

28
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:38,299
AGAIN THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO
CERTAIN THINGS AND ALSO ON

29
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:42,140
THE FLIPSIDE, YOU ARE TELLING
WOMEN THAT THEY SHOULD FEEL BAD

30
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,960
IF THEY SAY NO TO A GUY, THAT
THEY SHOULD BE MORE CONCERNED

31
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,079
ABOUT THE GUYS FEELINGS AS
OPPOSED TO THEIR OWN FEELINGS.

32
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,600
THIS SETS A REALLY DANGEROUS
STANDARD AND I HOPE THAT

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,080
THE SCHOOL CHANGES THEIR MINDS
ABOUT IT.

34
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,530
I KNOW THIS IS A PROGRESSIVE
OR CONSERVATIVE THING BECAUSE IT

35
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:01,210
MIGHT BE PROGRESSIVE IN THAT YOU
DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO FEEL BAD OR

36
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:05,540
FEEL LEFT OUT SO IT REMINDS ME
OF WHEN THEY CANCELED HUGGING A

37
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,649
GRADUATION AT SOME OF THE
SCHOOLS, REMEMBER WE DID A

38
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:10,649
STORY?

39
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,710
I DON'T. BECAUSE OF HOW THE
UNHOOKED FELT.

40
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,170
I'M SERIOUS,

41
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:19,780
THAT IS A REAL STORY GOT SO I DO
NOT KNOW IF WE ARE NOT YOUR

42
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,090
RUN-OF-THE-MILL LIBERALS OR
WHATEVER.

43
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,830
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS
A LIBERAL POLICY.

44
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,590
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY POLITICS
BEHIND THE STUCK.

45
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,550
AND IT IS UTAH WHICH IS
OVERALL VERY CONSERVATIVE BUT

46
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:35,730
ANYWAY, IT IS OKAY IF EVERY ONCE
IN A WHILE SOMEONE SAYS NO,

47
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,200
ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT AND IS
TALKING ABOUT.

48
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,250
THESE ARE

49
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,720
SIXTH-GRADERS AND YOU ARE
TEACHING THEM.

50
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,720
THE RULE IS

51
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,460
LITERALLY CALLED JUST DON'T SAY
NO.

52
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,460
THIS IS CRAZY.

53
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,460
IT'S

54
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,460
INSANE.

55
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,870
FOR THE SAKE OF THIS
CONVERSATION, LET'S EXTEND THIS

56
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,810
TO A BROADER DISCUSSION ABOUT
SOMETHING THAT I ACTUALLY DIDN'T

57
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,439
BELIEVE OCCURRED BUT ACTUALLY
DOES OCCUR AND I FEEL LIKE WE

58
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,049
NEED TO ADDRESS IT, THE CODDLING
THING BECAUSE CODDLING IS

59
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,189
ACTUALLY HAPPENING.

60
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:05,440
WE'RE
SINGING ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES

61
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,880
RIGHT NOW WERE STUDENTS ARE
LOSING THEIR MINDS OVER SPEAKERS

62
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,300
WHO DO NOT AGREE WITH THEIR
POLITICS.

63
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,300
WE CANNOT HAVE THIS

64
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,300
HAPPEN.

65
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,810
WE CAN'T BE OVERLY
CONCERNED ABOUT PEOPLE FEELING

66
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,959
OFFENDED OR PEOPLE GETTING THEIR
FEELINGS HURT OR CRUSHED.

67
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:20,959
THIS

68
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:21,959
IS LIFE.

69
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,780
LIFE BASICALLY
PRESENTS YOU WITH A BUNCH OF

70
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,420
APPLES.

71
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,900
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE
SHELTERED FROM THE MEANIES FOR

72
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,900
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

73
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,430
YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH REALITY.

74
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,540
YES, BOYS AND GIRLS BOTH NEED
TO UNDERSTAND THAT AT SOME

75
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,099
POINT IN YOUR LIFE YOU'RE
GOING TO FACE REJECTION.

76
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:42,400
WHEN YOU APPLY FOR A JOB, WHEN
YOU APPLY TO GO TO CERTAIN

77
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,510
SCHOOLS.

78
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,750
REJECTION IS JUST PART OF LIFE.

79
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,780
WE NEED TO ACCOMPANY KIDS UP A
LITTLE MORE.

80
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,469
AND LOOK, SOMETIMES IT'S A
LITTLE OVERSTATED BUT THERE ARE

81
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:53,689
SOME PLACES WHERE THEY HAVE THE
SAFE PLACES, ETC.

82
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:54,689
BUT IT

83
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:55,689
DEPENDS.

84
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:56,689
I'M NOT SAYING THAT
SHOULDN'T BE SAFE SPACES.

85
00:03:56,689 --> 00:03:57,689
THERE

86
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:00,379
SHOULD BE SPACE FOR YOU CAN
RELAX AND KNOW YOU ARE NOT GOING

87
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:02,650
TO BE HARASSED OR ASSAULTED.

88
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,700
IT'S NICE TO GO HOME AND HAVE

89
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,120
YOUR PARENTS TAKE CARE OF YOU OR
SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR EVEN IN A

90
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,650
DORM TO FEEL LIKE A, THIS IS NOT
THE PLACE WHERE WE ARE GOING TO

91
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:13,019
DEBATE OR GET ATTACKED BUT THAT
IS NOT THE WHOLE WORLD.

92
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,019
THE

93
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:17,220
WHOLE WORLD IS FILLED WITH
PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE AND

94
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,380
REJECTION AND SURPRISES AND
CURVEBALLS IN TOUGH TIMES AND

95
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,300
YOU ARE GOING TO GET KNOCKED
DOWN.

96
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,300
THE ONLY QUESTION IS

97
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,340
WHETHER YOU GET BACK UP.

98
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,580
THAT IS
NOT GOOD AS A HALLMARK CARD IS

99
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,520
IN IS, THE WORLD IS FULL BATH.

100
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,520
THAT IS THE REALITY.

101
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,520
THE OTHER

102
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,410
DAY MY SEMINAL KID WAS AT A
SOCCER TOURNAMENT AND I WAS

103
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,130
WORRIED THAT THEY WERE ALL GOING
TO GET METALS BECAUSE THEY ARE

104
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,500
ALL SEVEN AND IT TURNS OUT THEY
WEREN'T AND ONLY THE CHAMPIONS

105
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,110
WERE GOING TO GET THE TROPHY AND
MY SON WAS SO EXCITED TO GET THE

106
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,110
TROPHY.

107
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,870
HE WANTED TO PLAY SO HARD AND
THEY GOT IT, NOT A BIG DEAL.

108
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,070
AND HE FINALLY TOOK A PICTURE
WITH THE TROPHY, THAT IS

109
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,041
HOW IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE AND
THERE PLENTY OF TIMES WERE

110
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:00,600
HEAT IN WINTER I DIDN'T WIN, YOU
FIGHT HARDER NEXT TIME AND

111
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,230
THAT IS LIFE.

112
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:07,320
I JUST FEEL LIKE IT BUILDS
CHARACTER AND WILLPOWER.

113
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,320
I

114
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,320
DON'T KNOW.

115
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,880
I KNOW THAT I'M
CONSIDERED A MILLENNIAL BUT I

116
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,750
JUST GREW UP IN A DIFFERENT
HOUSEHOLD WHERE MY IMMIGRANT

117
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,730
PARENTS BASICALLY TOLD ME IF YOU
FAIL AT SOMETHING IT IS NOT

118
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,670
EVERYONE ELSE'S FAULT, IS
PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT

119
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:26,310
WORKING HARD ENOUGH, MAYBE YOU
NEED TO DO THIS OR DO THINGS

120
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,310
DIFFERENTLY.

121
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,510
IF I GOT REJECTED
BY ANYTHING, I DID BALLET

122
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,510
GROWING UP.

123
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,350
IF I DIDN'T GET THE
SOLO I WANTED, THEY WOULDN'T

124
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,210
GOING YELL AT THE DANCE
INSTRUCTOR ABOUT HOW I DIDN'T

125
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,120
GET THE SOLO.

126
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,150
THEY WOULD TELL
ME, YOU NEED TO WORK HARDER AND

127
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,380
PRACTICE MORE.

128
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,260
I JUST FEEL LIKE THIS CULTURE
THAT WE ARE SETTING UP

129
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,930
WHERE EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE
CONCERNED ABOUT EVERYONE

130
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,690
ELSE'S FEELINGS IS A BAD IDEA.

131
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,570
LAST TWO THINGS ON THIS.

132
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,300
THIS WHOLE IDEA, AND I'VE SEEN

133
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,490
OTHER LIBERALS HONESTLY TEACH,
THEY NEVER WANT TO SAY NO TO THE

134
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,780
KIDS BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS
NEGATIVE AND NOT THE RIGHT WAY

135
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,780
TO GO.

136
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,780
MY PARENTS AND OATMEAL
THE TIME.

137
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,780
YOU KNOW WHY QUESTION

138
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,780
WE DIDN'T HAVE MONEY.

139
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,780
CAN I BUY
THAT?

140
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,940
NO DOUBT CAN WE GET A

141
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,940
BIKE?

142
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,760
NO DOCUMENTED TV QUESTION
NO DOUBT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE

143
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,360
MONEY AND THAT IS THE WORLD WE
LIVE IN AND THAT IS OKAY.

144
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
YOU

145
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,360
WORK HARD AND YOU GET IT.

146
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,190
I DO
WORK UNTIL I COULD PAPER MY OWN

147
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,580
BIKE AND COULD PAPER MY OWN
BLACK-AND-WHITE TV, THAT IS HOW

148
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,420
OLD I AM AND THEN FINALLY I'M
GETTING THOSE FROM WOMEN.

149
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,530
THE

150
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,630
HUNDREDS OF THOSE.

151
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,630
YOU KNOW
WHAT IS IT?

152
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,630
IT HELPS ME TO GET

153
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:35,440
BETTER AND BETTER SO YOU GO
ACROSS YOUR THAT A HIGH SCHOOL,

154
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,560

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,050
AND SAY CAN I GET IT IS AND THEY
SAY NO, THAT DOESN'T WORK AND

156
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,840
SLOWLY YOU GET BETTER AT IT YOU
FIGURE OUT HEY, HOW DO I MAKE

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,790
THIS PERSON HAPPY AND WANT TO GO
OUT WITH ME WESTERN MARK

158
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,330
AND IF YOU NEVER GET THAT YOU
JUST GET BIG GUESSES IT

159
00:06:53,330 --> 00:00:00,000
DOES NOT HELP YOU.
