I WOULD ARGUE IT'S NONE OF THEIR BUSINESS AHEAD OF TIME. OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS WITH THE FIRST LADY. LAST YEAR PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK MAINSTREAM DESTROYED TRUMP MEDIA REFERRING TO THE NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR KIM JONG UN AS LITTLE ROCKET MAN. REMEMBER THIS? President Trump: BY THE WAY, ROCKET MAN SHOULD HAVE BEEN HANDLED A LONG TIMING A. A. A LONG TIME AGO. HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN HANDLED A LONG TIME AGO BY CLINTON. I WON'T MENTION THE REPUBLICANS, RIGHT? BY OBAMA. WHY DID THIS, YOU KNOW, THIS IS A DIFFERENT, THIS IS A DIFFERENT TIME. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN HANDLED EIGHT YEARS AGO, FOUR YEARS AGO. HONESTLY, 15 YEARS AGO. AND 20 YEARS AGO. AND 25 YEARS AGO. THIS SHOULDN'T BE HANDLED NOW. BUT I'M GOING TO HANDLE IT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HANDLE IT. Sean: REMEMBER AT THE TIME PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA CRITICIZEDDED THE PRESIDENT'S TOUGH RHETORIC BUT IT HAS CLEARLY WORKED NOW THE SUMMIT IS SET FOR NEXT MONTH. IN AN INTERVIEW ON "FACE THE NATION" THE NEW SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO WAS ASKED TO DESCRIBE WHAT TRUCK HIM ABOUT THE NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR STRUCK HIM ABOUT THE NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR. HE IS VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE IN THE SENSE HE KNOWS THE FILES. HE IS VERY CAPABLE OF ENGAGING IN COMPLEX SET OF DISCUSSIONS. WHEN I ASK HIM A QUESTION ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS A LITTLE OFF, HE ANSWERS IT. THERE ARE NO CARDS. IT'S CHAIRMAN KIM IN THIS CASE INTERACTING WITH ME DIRECTLY. HAVING A ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THE OUTLINES OF A SUCCESS NEGOTIATION BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES MIGHT ULTIMATELY BE. Sean: WITH THE REACTION, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST SEBASTIAN GORKA AND AUTHOR OF THE BEST SELLER. A FRIEND, WE DON'T ALWAYS AGREE. BUT HE IS MY BROTHER. GERALDO RIVERA. GOOD TO SEE YOU. BOTH OF YOU. LET ME START WITH YOU, GERALDO. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A FAN. POMPEO IS A GENIUS. I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF HIS FOR A LONG TIME AND I'M GLAD HE IS OUR SECRETARY OF STATE. WHAT HE SAYS TO ME IS IMPRESSIVE. THINK ABOUT THIS. TRUMP CALLS HIM "LITTLE ROCKET MAN" AND HE SHOWS MILITARY FORCE AND PUTS SANCTIONS IN PLACE. THE ROCKETS STOP BEING FIRED. WORLD IS SAFER. THREE HOSTAGES ARE RELEASED. HE CROSSES THE D.M.Z. AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA. YOUR KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT? GOOD STORY. I'LL SAY. IF YOU CONSIDER HOW MUCH WE TRAVELED SINCE THE OLYMPICS. JUST SINCE THE OLYMPICS. IF I WAS A DIPLOMAT I'D SAY I WAS CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC. I'M NOT A DIPLOMAT. AND I'M NOT DIPLOMATIC. Sean: NO KIDDING. WE KNOW YOU. I DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT. I FEEL WE HAVE MOVED SO FAR. AND POMPEO IS A NUTS AND BOLTS KIND OF GUY. IT'S NOT PIE IN THE SKY. IT'S NOT WISHFUL THINKING ON THE PART OF PRESIDENT TRUMP. THESE ARE MEANINGFUL STEPS. RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES. ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IN TWO WEEKS HE WILL BE BLOWING UP THE TUNNELS TO HIS TESTING FACILITIES. THE FACT THAT HE IS AGREEING TO DISMANTLE. SHIP COMPONENT PARTS TO OAK RIDGE, TENNESSEE. IT IS SPECTACULAR, SEAN. IF THIS INDEED WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN, THIS IS THE BIGGEST MOVE TOWARD PEACE SINCE THE FOUNDING OF THE UNITED NATIONS. Sean: AND THAT LITERALLY THE ALLIANCE CREATED BY THE PRESIDENT, ISRAEL, THE JORDANIANS, THE EGYPTIANS, SAUDIS, EMIRATES. NO CARGO PLANES OF CACHE. HUGE DIFFERENCE. IT'S AMAZING WHAT DIFFERENCE ONE ELECTION CAN MAKE. IT TRULY IS. THESE ARE THE KIND OF RESULTS YOU WOULD BE PROUD OF AT THE ENT OF A TWO-TERM PRESIDENCY. I WAS IN TOUCH WITH MIKE POMPEO TODAY. THE SPIRITS ARE VERY HIGH. WE HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS. REMEMBER, THIS IS A DICTATORSHIP. THIS IS A REGIME THAT KEPT ITS PEOPLE PRISONER. AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU PUT THESE THINGS ON A WHITE BOARD IN JUST 15 MONTHS. ALL OF THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN REMARKABLE TO HAVE A SUMMIT ON KOREAN PEACE IN EIGHT YEARS' TIME. NOT NEXT WEEK OR THE WEEK AFTER. SO STUNNING. FROM THE 70th BIRTHDAY OF THE MODERN ISRAELI STATE TO THE OPENING OF THE EMBASSY, THE HIT JUST KEEP COMING. Sean: GERALDO, I WILL SAY THIS. THAT AND PULLING OUT OF THE IRANIAN DEAL AND THE GREAT NEWS ON THE ECONOMY, AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. ALL THE NOISE I ARGUE IS NOT GOING TO MEAN A THING WHEN IT COMES TO 2018 ELECTION. I BELIEVE THIS ELECTION WILL BE ABOUT THE ECONOMY DOING SO MUCH BETTER. A WORLD BEING A SAFER PLACE. A PRESIDENT KEEPING HIS PROMISES AND A DESIRE TO ROLL BACK TAX CUTS AND IMPEACH THIS PRESIDENT WILL BE ON THE BALLOT IN EVERY CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT. YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU SAY THAT. I AGREE. AND DO YOU KNOW WHO ELSE AGREES? THE "NEW YORK TIMES" WEEK IN REVIEW HAD AN ARTICLE I THOUGHT WAS VERY, VERY TELLING. IT SAID LIBERALS ARE SO SMUG, THEY KNOW IT ALL. THEY ARE SO SURE THAT THEY HAVE GOD ON THEIR SIDE AND THAT TRUMP IS THE DEVIL INCARNATE THAT THEIR ATTITUDE IS GOING TO LEAD THEM DOWN THE PRIM ROSE PATH. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DOING A SPECTACULAR JOB WITH THE ECONOMY AS YOU MENTIONED. AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT, HISPANIC UNEMPLOYMENT AND FEMALE UNEMPLOYMENT, INDICATORS OF OPTIMISM AND EVERYTHING POINTED UP. IF HE CAN DELIVER TRUE DENUCLEARIZED KOREAN PENINSULA, THE ATOMIC CLOCK THAT TICKS TOWARD MIDNIGHT WOULD L HAVE TO BE SET BACK FIVE OR TEN MINUTES. THIS IS A PROFOUND STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. Sean: GIVE DR. GORKA THE LAST WORD. SEAN, GERALDO, THE PRESIDENT MAKES PROMISES. HE KEEPS PROMISES. THIS IS WHAT MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN LOOKS LIKE. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SEVEN MORE YEARS OF IT AND THEN EIGHT YEARS OF PRESIDENT PENCE. Sean: WHAT ABOUT PRESIDENT GERALDO? I THOUGHT HE WAS RUNNING. PRESIDENT HANNITY, I HEAR HE IS NEXT IN LINE. Sean: EVERYONE WRITES THESE STORIES ABOUT ME, NOBODY
