I'm Ezra levan it's June 11th and you're watching battleground hello it is Monday I Maslov Anand the president of the rebel dawn media every weekday at 12 noon Eastern Time I take an hour to chats it's called super chat which is a word that YouTube invented it means it's on the side of the screen as you can see there there's tons of comments just scrolling scrolling scrolling but you can make your comment stand out in a super way that's their word by chipping in a few dollars pounds pesos whatever it's sort of fun to see and the more dough is to gain the longer it stays up there and the reason this is good for YouTube creators is that the money's actually paid to us it's not pocketed by YouTube so that's a bit of a miracle what I like to do in these 12noon chats is show you some casual news stories that I don't go in to as great depth on in my 8 p.m. Eastern Time shows and of course reading the comments is always fun in fact just as I was waiting for the top of the hour I saw someone in the UK said hey Ezra did you hear when Nick Ferrari had to say about the imprisonment of Tommy now Nick Ferrari I happened to know is a UK radio host and other public personality I don't think he's known at all on this side of the pond the answer is no I am unfamiliar with what he said but just in the moments that I had there I googled and I saw the headline basically saying why Nick Ferrari thinks that Tommy Robinson protesters are all wrong so he's against Tommy I'll have to look into why and in on live TV it's not the time to do it but we will have reports to you there was a ton can we put up the the aerial image the size of the crowd when I first saw this image of the size of the crowd I actually couldn't even believe it I don't believe that I thought that maybe this was some other protest some other event because I mean how do you know from the sky how big you know if this is one rally or the other my confidence monitors is not on so maybe during a clip we can turn that on but you see that that is tens of thousands but that's at least 10,000 people I've seen credible estimates put that anywhere from ten to fifteen fifteen to twenty thousand excuse me and I actually saw one that said thirty thousand that strikes me as a bit high but ten thousand absolutely believable that's ten thousand and there were a number of amateur and professional videographers there who were kind enough to send us the footage and thank you for that and we will use it as needed in fact will use it a little bit today I find these free Tommy rallies very encouraging because they're so organic and what I mean by bad is they're not run by some big organization Tommy himself is obviously not there to lead them he's in prison in HMP how Her Majesty's Prison Hull Rahim Kassim the former editor of Breitbart UK is was a keynote speaker and of course of course here at builders that's on paper that looks like geert wilders he's the leader of the second most popular party in the Netherlands and came within a few percentage of winning their election last time he was there and that probably stimulated the crowd there was a ton of police there and I received a very detailed report from a former Canadian police officer who said that in his view the police were trying to I don't want to misquote him but the police handled things and kept one crowd at bay and another in a manner that would have revved up any conflict and I don't want to be paranoid but when it comes to Tommy Robinson you need a healthy sense of skepticism I've seen the police deal unfairly with Tommy before for those of you who recall Tommy had a book launch event in Manchester a few months back and he found a venue willing to take him it was it I think the boxing or venue or so it's a concert venue outside the city centre owned by someone who's a Tommy supporter very high security they would have a hundred security private security police would be welcome they would screen everyone coming in it was going to be a sit-down dinner and a book launch for Tommy's book Mohammed so tell me and I remember dealing with Tommy he was so excited that he finally found someone who was solid as a rock it would not cave in on the venue because of course anti-fur bullied him in other concerts pulled the plug you know the project the prodigy that aging punk band breathed the pressure come play my game I'll test you you know that that band the prodigy they canceled a venue a concert at the same venue because tommy was going to be there as if he's got cooties and Tommy germs would infect the whole place so the owner of this venue he dug in it's a it's a first-class venue it's it's really a mean you could see if they have you know concerts and whatnot there so they held firm there was the all the leftist wagging their fingers the venue owner held firm the prodigy canceled their concert probably cost the venue 20 30 grand he held firm Tommy's invitations went out people bought their tickets and the day of the police went to the venue owner and said and didn't say we're here to help they said if you know what's good for you you will cancel this venue we can't guarantee your safety well actually that bet is sort of your job to guarantee the safety they keep keep order isn't it that was the police's way of basically saying if you let Tommy Robinson have a venue in Manchester and the Manchester city government is it's just awful there really as bad as sad it can in London I mean just awful so when the police comes to you and you've got a venue worth millions of dollars and you have a huge staff and you're about to do a big event but the police literally say oh hi there nice concert venue you have here would be a shame if anything happened to it we highly recommend you cancel this event because something could happen so that police literally forced or said things that cause such terror in that he withstood the ante for threats he withstood the rival concert there other concert cancellations but when the cops threatened the money gonna you can't argue with the cop they got the guns again argue with them tommy said to the cops oh well I've got a thousand friends coming to town so I guess you'd rather have us all meet in the city square and that's what we're going to do and the cop said oh but but what might you're gonna add I'm not gonna try and do my British accents because either they're not funny or too funny or someone I I'm not trying to make fun I'm just trying to capture the spirit of the cops saying oh what you're gonna go ahead and instead of it being in a controlled closed environment with security and metal detectors and orderly you're gonna have it in the city centre yikes and they literally asked the Manchester venue owner to REE go to reap recede to to have it back on and then Manchester venue said yeah no thanks mate can you believe it so my point is when I read this report from a Canadian retired law enforcement saying that he thought the police in the UK were handling it in a manner that exacerbated tensions I thought well I've seen the police I've seen the police Tommy videotapes his interactions with the police I've seen the police screw over Tommy in Manchester so why would it not happen to Tommy supporters in London I think I saw a super check go by as his first irregular keep up the good work the protest was glorious thank you I see another one from Andrews senior hey Ezra the aerial image is st. George's Hall in Liverpool it was taken when Liverpool won the Champions League in 2005 okay well thank you for clarifying that I had seen that image and like I just said that could have been anywhere let me show you footage that absolutely for certain was from the free Tommy rally this weekend because you can see the signs I'd like to start with a clip of it was a couple speakers I mentioned here builders Gerrard batten was there he's the he was the head of you kept we interviewed him the other day and Murray waters is the head of for Britain a new political party a hair builders let's start with a clip from n Murray waters she ran for leadership of you Kip Tommy endorsed her supporter she didn't make it she started her own new party called Fort Britain Morrissey the rock star it seems to like her a lot so here's Ann Marie waters and by the way we're expecting and to have an extended interview with Ann Marie waters if not this week next week we've been in touch with her she actually reached out to me after she saw the Girard batten interviews and hey what about me I said sure so we'll talk to her later but here is Ann Marie waters here's a clip it's not her whole speech from the free Tommy rally on the weekend placed in danger he's had affairs of lies thrown at him from the press lies that puts his life in danger and lives that put all of our lives in danger and lives that was our country in danger shame on the media I think that's true and I'm watching the media coverage of the rally it it's like they're living in another youniverse are we ready with a here village clip do we have that one ready here's builders I had the pleasure of interviewing him a couple years ago we flew to Amsterdam just for that he gave us more than half an hour it was very interesting anyway I really enjoyed it I won't say I'm close with your village but I chat with him from time to time by direct message on Twitter I really like that I really like that he fights hard I really like that he has such a high security team because if he didn't he would be killed he would be assassinated in fact when I went to Holland to interview him we were worried that our interview would be scuppered because literally the day before there was a summit of moroccan origin on his security team that was detected was leaking details about cured filters whereabouts I don't know what the details are but you can imagine how terrifying that is to have a bodyguard of care builders leaking the detail and you would you would like to I mean I I know that you're builders has staff around him who are from different ethnic and religious backgrounds the idea though that you would put a Moroccan Muslim bodyguard on the case of care builders is sort of beggin for trouble I mean it was it was an ethnic separatist who murdered Indira Gandhi was an Muslim Brotherhood separate sister murdered Anwar Sadat I mean when you are assigned to protect the life of someone I'm afraid you do have to scream for politics and things of that sort without further ado here builders I love that chance I love that chant hey can we see if we can find it just is b-roll is fine some of the footage that those folks sent us I just want to show from the crowd I mean it's good to see Ann Marie waters from the front give me a speech and Kerr builders from the back we didn't I think we borrowed those shots from other photographers who sent them to us with permission I'd like just to show as b-roll the background footage of the size of the crowd from within the crowd we got some of that by we transfer the weekend there were would you agree with me that there were thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of people there I don't know if it was 10 15 20,000 don't know but the size of the protest seems to be getting bigger not smaller and the caliber of the speaker seems to be getting higher not lower I mean listen everyone has the moral worth to give a speech it doesn't matter how big or little you are but when you have the leaders of two parties there for Britain and Gerard Benton and hear builders the leader of a foreign party the party for freedom in Holland that you're getting big you're getting big and the mainstream media in the UK no longer ignores these rallies they smear them in this case there were some folks who fought with police it was a very small number out of let's say they're just a conservative estimate let's say there were 10,000 people to rally maybe 20 of them fought with cops there were some arrests but what do you think made the pages of the UK papers the speeches do you think they quoted and Marie Waters Gerard baton here Villiers or do you think they just showed pictures of soccer hooligans but they would have called soccer hooligans fighting with the cops and I say again I've seen such shenanigans with the British police towards Tommy that who knows if those were agents provocateurs as in people the cops send in and I'm not saying they're on payroll but just hey here's 50 bucks who's 50 quid go start a ruckus and we can therefore tar all 10,000 people so this look at this this is footage that someone sent us look at the size of that look at this side you can see a for Britain sign there you can see the UK Union Jack there's a generation indented tear flag you can see that purple flag is the u-clip flag if I'm not mistaken I think that's Trafalgar Square you see the English flag that's the st. George's Cross as they call it that is a big crowd would you agree with me that's that's serious and I think it's really organic I mean some tweets and Facebook and stuff like that but this is not this is not well funded or look at that free Tommy that looks like it was obviously printed professionally but unless I'm unaware there is no organisation Tommy is the leader of Tommy and he's in prison that's quite something to see it's sort of 16 let me make sure that I've caught up on all the super chats that do I saw a couple Keith Mackintosh chipped in to quit thank you very much for that and let me just scroll up a bit I may have missed some Tom young John two bucks says thanks for her focusing on Tommy's persecution well you're welcome the corker chipped in five bucks and thank you for all of that we talked about Tommy because he used to work for us he worked for us for a year and we talk about Tommy because like you we care about the stories he tells and his ability to say them and like you we are concerned about the reaction he is elicited from the state it's obvious that Muslim extremists and those who want to propagate Sharia would hate Tommy that's a given but it was Tommy's first best-selling book is called the enemy of the state because the state finds him a greater inconvenience than the Muslim extremism he exposes or if not a greater inconvenience they find tackling him is easier that's how I should phrase him that's the path of least resistance I've had this happen to me before when I used to work at the Sun News Network there was a protest of over a hundred crazies coming to protest me at the Sun News Network so I came down and I went on the street and we had a camera there and I said well let's talk to these people so I walked out and I wasn't really worried they were sort of you know it's broad daylight and Robbie dubs and there's lots of cops there so I was interviewing these people and I was just saying why are you here what are you mad about I thought I was being very friendly I was using my - friendly voice hi why are you here and then suddenly a police officer sort of scoops me up and whisks me away and my first reaction was oh they obviously saw something behind me that I didn't see so they're coming to protect me thank goodness the cops are there because they're pulling me away from behind they obviously saw some threat that I didn't that was my first thought about five seconds later I realized no no there was no threat behind me there's no threat at all they just didn't like the interaction I was having completely peaceful and voluntary and instead of shooing away a hundred protesters it was much easier for them just to grab me and pull me away and the camera was running and I do you think we can find that Hannah or is that too hard to find that clip it would be from the old Sun if we find that that was from the old son who say that predates the rebel but my point is that's not upholding the law that's keeping the peace I guess but that's keeping the peace by cracking down on the easiest path one of me is a lot easier for the cops to restrain than a hundred anti-fat types they weren't quite Antipa back then same thing with Tommy one Tommy Robinson is a lot easier to put in prison then tens of thousands of rape gangs are tens of thousands of rapists in hundreds of rape gangs what's interesting about these huge rallies is that's maybe changing the map a little bit and making it harder to throw Tommy away I got to read some regular chats it's 12:20 but a third of our time is gone I'm gonna read I'll probably read chats for about 10 minutes then I'll show you a preview of our show called off-the-cuff Declassified I'll give you a one-minute clip on that and then I will start a little bit about some of the anti-trump celebrities at the Tony Awards I know most people saying Tony what was that it's it's for Broadway plays and Robert De Niro made a guest appearance and I'll tell you what he said so let's read some super chat someone named Mitch boo she said all these people are Russian BOTS yeah you know I I know you're making a joke but it's a good joke because the left if they don't like something they say what's Russian right the russians hacked the streets of london apparently and 10,000 people showed up Pamela King well good for you British people yeah yeah you know I've said this before is that I think the Britain of the courageous Winston Churchill the Britain of you know battle for Trafalgar Square they were in Trafalgar Horatio Nelson those Brits have been replaced by docile passive status bureaucratic minded Brits and it's glad to see that old British spirit come back the spirit that slayed the dragon Blake Runner I would love to fly to Great Britain from Canada chant with you people free Tommy yeah it's quite something it's quite something to be in the midst of that sort of thing Keith McIntosh says my estimate was about eight to ten thousand people total one fellow I spoke with suggested the size far exceeded the free speech rather from a few weeks prior the Tommy chant alone was worth the trip thanks for covering yeah isn't that the truth that Tommy chant it's great I mean imagine having your own chance politicians would would love for that kind of personal affection to be attached to them Tommy's not a politician he's far more authentic than that and I think in short answer to your question Keith the reason the people have showed out in greater numbers is quite simply the Tommy is in great jeopardy he's no longer just being hassled by cops he's in prison 13 months sentence my understanding of British law is he won't serve the full sentence but he'll serve I would imagine at least a third of it which is a bloody long time to serve let's read some more Michelle Thompson are the police going to release Tommy is Jada in jail you're talking about Jada Frandsen and her partner Paul Golding they were arrested they're the leaders of a party called Britain first which is sort of a party it's also it was a Facebook page and some journalism they were arrested prosecuted convicted and imprison and I know that Paul was beat up in prison there one standard deviation more rambunctious than Tommy in some of their words and I don't know enough about them to to say that I support them in the manner I know Tommy very well and support him but but what I will say about Paul and Jana is that they were like Tommy concern with the Sharia creep in the UK so this is what the police do they throw you in jail they don't know the First Amendment over there and so Paul Goulding and Jada Frandsen and Tommy Robinson are all in prison because they don't have a First Amendment in the United Kingdom that's a fact okay Boleyn Shao says prison and police are now run by Muslims and then you came this in truth of that the prisons certainly are at least most of them prison gangs john zealand why did lucy brown get booed at the rally I don't know Lucy brown used to work with us at the rebel then she worked with Tommy I just don't know enough about what happened there I like Lucy and I don't know what that controversy is about so I can't explain images by lorry says free Tommy and the bravest men bravest of men warning his brethren that their sheep they see our wolves devouring the children yeah and that's the thing is these aren't just rape gangs their child rape gangs the case that Tommy was reporting about from Leeds the youngest victim was 11 do you know how little an 11 year old is that's who's being raped again and again and again again and again Katich BR says reminds me of what they did to the Trump rallies before he was elected was sending violent people in the crowd to cause trouble and make Trump supporters look violent you're exactly right I think the Democrats called that bird-dogging that's what them Democrats called it send people down to cause a fuss to inflame things to provoke and pick fights they would send someone early to be the very first person in line to say something insane to journalists to pick fights with Trump supporters basically to cause a ruckus and that was exposed very well by Project Veritas and James O'Keefe that's what's going on here but I think it's worse I mean Tommy told me that on several occasions he they detected the people who were joining his organization whether it was the EDL or later they were paid infiltrators including by either British authorities or foreign authorities that they were actually trying to infiltrate his group Tommy told me about some guy who was very eager oh I'm so ETL mate and I got 400 guys let's go and burn down a mosque like someone who would say things so insane like that that Tommy would never say clearly trying to radicalize the EDL for its own demise either to make it crumble under its own weight or to give a pretext for police to prosecutors it's a terrorist group or something those were police authorities from the UK and Tommy implied to me there may have been other countries too he said he was always on guard for people coming in undercover but they were not there to listen to what he was actually doing they were there to effectively plant things on him not like drugs or things something like that but to plant on him the oh whoa we were going to burn down no that was that was the government mole trying to provoke that said that and it would not surprise me one bit if these yobs who were finding police were government moles on that and they either were sort of high-level very strategic moles or they were just rubbing abs given 25 quid and told them here's some beer go make a fuss let's read a few more questions Frank Dempsey says yep saboteurs I think you're right Jake right says is Tommy still in hobb prison as best I know Bowlin shall all mainstream media are providing fake news and influence people against Trump brexit you Kip and other national things there's I think there's a fair bit of truth to that oh I think a super Chad is here let me scroll up and find it Tom young John any proof Tommy still alive well I understand that a family member met with him yesterday I haven't had a report from that family member yet but as far as I know Tommy is alive as far as I know how prison is one of that safer prisons in the UK for Tommy I also think that God forbid god forbid Tommy should be hurt or god forbid killed I think that that news would not be able to stay silent it would just be too shocking and those 20,000 people you see in the street or 10,000 or whatever it is I don't think they would be peaceful if Tommy were to be killed in prison which is so predictably what could happen by putting him in prison hey here's a super chat from El Chupacabra who says have you heard Owen Benjamin's Tommy Robinson song how they really it's a gem you're right can we call that video up I saw it and Owen Benjamin is is a woke read pilled comedian and I've never watched his shows in person I've seen a couple of his youtube vids and this one it's touching it's well song sung the lyrics are strong it's it's a it's a song you know the tune you know and I found myself watching the whole thing I'm not gonna play the whole thing for you but let me give you two minutes of oh and Benjamin song so el chapo capital thanks for the great recommendation how they rule yeah which is sung to the tune of hallelujah by Leonard Cohen take a listen which means can we get the original I just cuz I want to give credit to the man who I think came up with himself so that was a cover of Owen Benjamin song that's the song but that was a cover and I and I want to show the fella himself let me know when he got that it's not critically important but it's a it's a good one let me read some more chats in the meantime Lauren southern spelt the masculine way says I love the chats that Owen and Stefan have I haven't watched those but maybe I should I just don't have the time there's so much going on there's so many people saying anything in this world of citizen journalism you know I just we we put 10 videos up a day I don't even have time to watch all those before they go up Keith McIntosh is another super Chad he says Quebec police infiltrated demonstrators and were main instigators in the 2007 montebello leaders meeting lots of coverage on that one they were busted wearing police issued boots I think I remember that and there were some cases I can't remember if it was in the UK or in Canada or the US about some of these undercover cops who had sex with an tyfa women and i would say to that i hope they got danger paid but you know there were these ethical questions of these police were coming in and lying and they had a personal relationship with us and they kissed us and they had sex with us and the whole time they were just going into cover I think that's what undercover mean undercover doesn't have to mean under the covers but if you're undercover you have to take on that whole new identity and I mean I think there should definitely be rules about undercover cops but I'm not sure how I mean if it's okay to have undercover cops and if they're following rules and if they're not committing crimes themselves and if they're under authority under careful observation and supervision if they're going undercover to break open a drug gang or a kidnapping or human trafficking gang I don't see a large moral difference with them going undercover to stop anti far almost invariably violent and if they have sex with an anti-fog person along the way well they're braver than I sure would be but yeah there's some questions there I'm poking some fun at anti-fog but yeah I think police I think I think undercover police there's a place for them but what I'm talking about here is not running with the devil to to keep track of the devil but running with the devil to encourage them and what I'm telling you that I've observed in the case of Tommy and here in Canada with the so called hate speech police is that the police make the hate crime because there's not enough of in existing the police provoked the incidents because they're not watching for someone else to commit a crime that committing it he would grab that Owen Benjamin original version take a look I heard there was a secret court where journalists were it goes like this without the fear the gavel Falls and they cover the risk it's not okay this is how they rule while they rule now they wrong you know he's surprisingly good maybe I maybe it's not surprising me I mean maybe I just don't know maybe he's good like I thought that was well-written I thought it was well performed well sung I'm not even gonna call it funny like he's a comedian but that's that's not even a joke that's just a found a very touching song and thank you I think that was held trapper cabra who suggested future millionaire chipped in for tea Indian rupees thank you very much for that I've seen Mexican pesos I've seen Swedish kronor it's 1233 I'm gonna read some Tomi comments for four maybe five more minutes and then in the last third of the show I'm gonna switch to Robert De Niro just because it's too much fun but why don't we take a very short break and I want to show you a promo for another show we have here called off-the-cuff Declassified the host of that is named John Cardillo he's a former NYPD cop who's now a pundit and you've probably seen him on Twitter it's very active on Twitter and I haven't seen this promo but it's on this show tonight so let's take a look at what that's about today an off-the-cuff Declassified the war words between Donald Trump and Justin Trudeau escalates what can we expect from the Trump kim sungon in North Korea we'll discuss Robert DeNiro goes unhinged at the Tony Awards and a former Secret Service agent warned authorities in parkland Florida at Stoneman Douglas High School was unsafe weeks before the shooting there you have it that strong Cardillo I was just in that moment there was looking at some of this chat comments Jake right says join us next protests the 14th of July in London for Tommy now Jake can you tell me who is us when you say join us who's the group is it you and some friends is it a Facebook page are you with Rahim kasam who was involved are you with some Tommy staff so and now that's a month away so it sounds like there's lots of good planning there tell me a little bit more because you know well if someone shows up well they it just be you and them or is it you were an army I don't know how the event on Saturday was really organized but I'm but I'm very pleased that it was organized and I'm very impressed with the size of it I'm just gonna read a couple more Buster Edwards says the cops that had sex with members of groups they were infiltrating were in the UK the met one of them had a child with a suspect police protected him from child support holy cabbage going undercover and then there's just that's that's I think that's probably going too far don't you know names has made me weep and my eyebrows fill up you're talking about it can we call out that Trudeau eyebrows clip just this short one Jeff since Trudeau I mean that we could talk a bit by my whole show at 8 p.m. tonight I've got like 45 minutes on Justin Trudeau so I don't want to give away too much stuff here today I hope you tune in am ia p.m. show but Justin Trudeau do the press conference and it looked like his it looked like his eyebrows we're following up I don't know how just just play 5 seconds or 10 seconds let's take a look what what's that all about I mean I I know there are people I think that usually women who don't have eyebrows and they have a tattoo I've seen eyebrow tattoos actually in fact a former political leader in Canada named Audrey McLaughlin had tattooed eyebrows idiot and you didn't even notice really what were these it looks sort of like the the red bird on Angry Birds or something can you pull up at just the red Angry Birds just for a comparison you know I think maybe it was just a shot maybe it was the light maybe it was the angle I can't believe that Justin Trudeau would have fake eyebrows but it sure looked that way someone later said it was just the angle of the camera and whatever it just made me think of of Angry Birds I don't know you know if they look like we don't need to show you the picture um all right it's 1237 and I think there was some there was some comments I mean if and I didn't miss any super chats that we got all the super chance I think we're all caught up okay I'm sorry you mentioned the eyebrows so I had to give you it let's switch gears I want to talk about Robert De Niro now I'll admit I love De Niro in some of his films I love him in he was in The Godfather right he was you know it's been so long since I've seen that he's in some great movies and he's built for some movies and he just plays a mobster so well he was in oh Jesus I've just I don't want to get the name it he's in old so many great films and then he's in a lot of duds he was in the intern I think just I guess he just needed the cash and then he was in that movie when him and I think Morgan Freeman and the other old farts I think it was called old farts or something where they were going on I a grandpa strip to Vegas or something like he's doing a lot of pitiful movies that it's like Michael Caine Michael Caine he doesn't enormous son he's retired now but he said an enormous a number of films and and not all of them are great but as he got older he had great roles I even think Michael Caine's roles in the Batman movies were strong but as he got old he didn't get desperate he kept his artistic standards I think Michael Caine at age 70 was just as powerful as Michael Caine is age 40 can you tell me the last time Robert De Niro had a movie that made you say that is right as opposed to haha look at De Niro and that like even that Meet the Fockers which I really liked it was starting to be a parody of himself the circle of trust it was funny but I I think the jokes were at De Niro's expensive was sort of like here's this a deep passionate actor raging bull.miss raging bull' right who has this whole career of being serious and the reason why he was a good fit for meet the Fockers was because he was basically selling out his whole legacy and making fun of it like Robert De Niro for an entire career was a heavy duty tough-guy hot temper lots of passion serious deadly Cape Fear maybe his greatest performance in my mind you know what I'm talking about can we grab the the the trailer to Cape Fear with with De Niro where he played a prisoner tatted up from knave to his chops put in prison because his own lawyer sold them out gets out of prison and has a vengeance plan against the story I just want to show you can you can you call up you either b-roll of the trailer yeah you can grow it up and put it up there while I'm talking about it I'm gonna say this is what 2002 about 1991 so you put the sound out let's put it listen to the sound up a bit tired oh thanks I needed that this town is so very nice that I would think it's just so very very nice what's your connection with this fella Alice's Laura purchased African something all right what was he in prison for no really what what did you do if you've been following me well small added waiter I guess we're gonna run to each other do you do that for a living this guy you threatened you he's clever so that the law can't touch him a daughter around sixteen sixteen you sir will be hearing from the Ethics Committee freaking psychopath in their faces I mean who knows what's true and what isn't here I called the vet many times Lee I told you not to let him it would be unethical of me to advise the citizens to take the law into his own hands you thought about me last night didn't you ladies from a black horse I'd say it's a hell of a show as a hell of a show twenty-seven years old that movie so it feels a little bit dated let me tell you that is a terrifying movie De Niro is perfect you can see was fit and tough back then the tats were great out of prison diabolical Cape Fear perfect perfect movie what's my point De Niro used to make movies like that all the time a little bit crazy a little bit tough raw powerful and then he just sort of said alright well I need some cash and I'm not getting the great rolls and I've had a few shows that sucked but let me just if you pay me a hundred thousand I'll have a cameo there if you pay me half a million I'll I'll let you know if you pay me a million you can make me the headliner and it's some stupid slapstick comedy but here's my point I mean Schwarzenegger actually did some great comedy believe it or not the rock managed I mean there are people who can be tough and I the rocks never been that tough but De Niro's comedy work only works in the juxtaposition to his tough-guy work it's as if he sold out his whole repertoire for some gags that's how lame he is tell me the last time DeNiro had a head can you tell me tell me the last time he had a head I see a super chat and then I'm gonna show you why I'm ranting about De Niro Andrews senior Ezra who's going to win the World Cup I have no clue I don't even know who's who I can't even answer the question I can't even cool as I am about sports at least the World Cup they do know you're talking about soccer where she say over there football here's my point Robert De Niro who has not had a hit in a decade well he knows that he can still get attention not with a hip movie but by swearing at Donald Trump take a look I'm gonna say one thing fuck Trump it's no longer down with trumpets fuck Trump Wow well he's very very courageous to say that to a group of Broadway stars and Hollywood insiders that took courage who know they might have booed him for that he might have been blacklisted and he wouldn't be asked to do Meet the Fockers part 17 anymore um listen I like politics as you know I think there ought to be some parts of our lives that aren't political I don't think every single goddamn Hollywood plane or a Broadway show has to be political but that's how you got a profanity and it's a reminder that actors like a lot of musicians they're not actually saying their own words 90% of the time and they're not singing their own words probably 50 percent of the time they're just hired to read what someone else wrote I think Robert DeNiro really really needs a script writer because if the most eloquent thing he can say the most dramatic compelling shocking persuasive thing he can say is to swear at Donald Trump that's not gonna that that's just not persuasive Cape Fear you were riveted I was this f you f Trump that's the new resistance he used to be down with Trump actually never heard that now it's F Trump and and they were just they were thrilled they were thrilled yeah he probably thought he said F Trump but I think what 62 million Trump voters heard was fu and it reminds me it's a cousin to the NFL fight where all these millionaire insiders are creating a mutual admiration society and echo chamber reinforcing each other but the rest of America is yeah if you're talking about me and I you know I might not like everything Trump to you but I wrote a forum or some orderman so you're basically saying fu and now I don't really want to pay to see your movies anymore don't tell me that didn't happen in part to the NFL I see a super chat jabber wolf says doesn't the FCC now have rules to find people for profanity on TV did they let that slide for liberals it's a good question I understand there was a live broadcast that was a Tony Awards you know no Bologna how many people in a thousand knows whether if you will go to someone on the streets and say what's a Tony Award I don't think they would know the Oscars I think most people would know if you would say the Grammys I think probably half of people would know the Tony Awards what an insular inside game if you think DeNiro was bad I want to show you an actress that she's a Brit and she'll detect but she's an American now but she doesn't like the American president and she has a very stern message for him take a look at this one thing that's surprising about Harry Potter is that even though it doesn't it's not as overtly political like something like angels in America I sort of feel like there are moments in it there are things that happen with he who may not who must not be named that have real resonance today in particularly in America are you aware of that do you feel that I really do believe that that's why this is resonating a lot at the moment London when it started beautiful and there was a moment when okay this is the storytelling but now two to three years later since we've opened in London to be here you go actually this story's getting deeper and deeper and deeper and we as all us human beings are all fighting to be connected but especially to be seen if you're not seen or not heard that's what dangerous stuff happens that's where people under the radio do very cruel things and that's what this play is about and it's about bringing things into the light letting your light shine this is what Jake has always been about letting the darkness out into the light and that's why I'm very proud to be here telling the story right now because as you intimated those things are very important should the president come see the Harry Potter Harry Potter in the crash trial No thank you anybody else yes oh I thought the message and it was a message that someone else said was why don't we just bake people their cake and just serve them anyways so I get it so force a Christian cake baker to inscribe a message in icing on a cake that they don't like just do it but the President of the United States cannot come to watch a show in the United States because some Brit says no now I believe in freedom of association but again you know it's I I don't think the president the United States was was going to go and see a Harry Potter Broadway show I mean I don't know the man's tastes sinful but I there's some really weird about Harry Potter shows the left loves those books it's like it's the only books they read and every cultural reference every political reference is always Harry Potter and it's I just can't get into it I mean I don't even know if there's an I mean on the right I think a lot of right-wingers reading it I'm Rand III did when I was in high school but then they sort of move on I mean they just don't keep referring Harry Potter that's that children's series that's I mean not for infants but that's that's like for tweens and teens I don't think Donald Trump is gonna go and watch a Harry Potter Broadway show there's a great tweet by James Woods who said I have heartbreaking news mr. president I know you're in Korea right now trying to solve that problem and bring world peace but I got some heartbreaking news for you you are not welcome at the Harry Potter Broadway show it's just funny so I'm 52 I you know a lot of people who go see Broadway shows they live in New York of course the Broadway shows are extremely expensive you know there are some tickets on Broadway that are now more than 500 I'm not talking about scalped tickets I'm talking tickets this is like the the price on the face of it $500 if I Bruce Springsteen has had a show on Broadway and I I'm going from memory here I haven't looked at the story in a while his average ticket price is 500 500 bucks yeah it's all those aging vainly baby boomers who really like Bruce Springsteen 30 years ago and now they've got some money so they don't mind dropping a GNote for a more intern interim intimate excuse me evening with Bruce Springsteen I mean it sort of makes sense if you're a millionaire and this is your childhood memories of Bruce Springsteen you'll drop a G note make it a fancy weekend in in Manhattan but beyond that elite Manhattan circle I mean I think Broadway shows there's something that people from flyover country save up for and they have a big trip and they go to Times Square and they maybe they take in a show at what point in time does that NFL phenomenon kick in and they say you know when no thanks if Mike Pence is not welcome at the Madison Broadway musical and if Donald Trump is not welcome at the Harry Potter musical because you know he wants to go at one point in time to fly over Americans saying you know and I'm not really interested either make it super check come by them and take a look see thanks for supporting Tommy after Chad open to all thank you let's read some more chats oh I think I might have missed one so let me go to my emails here we go out daft UK says being a celebrity is about being popular fake yeah some of it can be I don't think anyone in America knows who that lady was that Brit who said Trump sounds like you like first of all she's from Britain obviously now there's some successful Brits in America Piers Morgan had a short but you know interesting round in America he won The Apprentice in America which gave him a bit of a following in America he didn't do well in his TV talk show look it's just cultural differences between the two countries but that actress on Broadway I just don't think any Americans know who she is I just don't think they do so I don't think it's about being popular in her case she probably has some talent and she probably knows the part she probably got really good at it in the UK and so they're onto her and sure why not live in New York for a season what a great city so she's trying to stack her popular support against Donald Trump so I think she's gonna lose at that match it's 12:55 let's take some more questions Chrissy James has check out Jordan B Peterson re Harry Potter I will you know I will I and I don't want to prejudge what he has to say the night Green says British people don't know who she is it does not surprise me you know I learned a word in the UK I learned a lot of words ever I told you some of where it's at Tommy taught me I mean and some of them I knew I just didn't see them and practice a lot like he calls everyone brough or mate I think it's fun but one word I learned and I don't think it was from him I can't member who was to call fancy starlets and other sort of red carpet celebrities to call them lovey's Lu Vivi IES that makes me laugh catid JB are said she was probably paid to say that no no that's where you're wrong I think she just knows that that's how they think in the hive mind and that she says that like De Niro she'll be safe I mean imagine if De Niro would have come out and said something actually courageous like let's you know we all have our differences with Donald Trump but let's wish him well in his visit in North Korea millions of people's security and freedom license if that would be brave you probably get some boos but that would be meaningful maybe I imagine if he said it's been six months but we can't forget the brave women and men in Iran who were rising up for democracy and to take off their hijab so you don't have to mention Trump you could talk about Iran and the people's rebellion there or I don't know you could talk about something that actually maybe I don't know prison reform Kim Kardashian just got a black woman who was said you know I'm talking about that lady with Alice Johnson I think is her name in prison for 21 years got that prison sentence community you saw the video for being released was so beautiful that's what Kim Kardashian did she said all right I have a public reputation I have some momentum some political capital I'm gonna I'm gonna work Trump I'm gonna get him to let this woman free and she did what's de niro done and okay fine you know you don't like Trump you hate him so much you don't want to go to him for his power of the pardon if I will do something else do something else instead to stand up and say the easiest Richard signalling thing throw up like it wasn't even creative it wasn't even funny it wasn't even original it's just you know boy without a writer DeNiro is awful I want to remember Robert De Niro as he was in Cape Fear in my mind the most powerful performance I've ever seen him in instead he says he's just getting old isn't he and he needs a writer and it's sort of pitiful that you get more attention for cursing the president then you do for any of your last ten films that's too bad jungle junior Hollywood equals boring well that's not true but so much of what they do is so politically propagandistic that I think it's discounted I mean you're probably too younger to remember it but I remember the Gulf War there was probably a dozen the anti war movies cranked out all of them lost money they were so unwatchable but it was Hollywood virtue singling in its own way the jolly jester Ezzor people don't want you watching Clifford the Big Red Dog okay I don't know much about that I know there's a children's book series I read those to my kids with the Green Knight Robert dementia no I don't think so I don't think he's lost his mental faculties I think he's just lost his momentum we got one minute left let me just I see someone Norway Rob Henderson July 14th is the next massive free Tommy Robinson demonstration I would ask again Norway can you tell me more about that can you tell us more about that are you associated with any group is that just happening organically is their Facebook page are you working with any of Tommy's staff or family or keV Carroll his cousin I would just like to know because this this weekend's event was huge and it's very successful I like the idea that you that July 14th gives you more than four weeks planning time that could be huge I would just I'm just curious and I think our viewers are as well you know what there's I think I covered all the the super chats we're at the top of the hour I appreciate your time for those of you who want more on me between the Trudeau and Trump spat I got my whole show on it today I'm gonna be going on some lengths about it and then I'll be interviewing my friend Manny Montana Greenough who's also very tough on this file so that's at 8 p.m. eastern time you can find out more at the rebel dot media slash shows
