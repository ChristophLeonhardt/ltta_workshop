he's a lawyer representing stormy Daniels Michael thanks so much for being back with us a couple questions that weren't answered last night maybe you can help us out on you tweeted out a picture of a CD and said if a picture's worth a thousand words how much is this worth what what's what's on that CD and why didn't we hear from stormy Daniels last night about the contents of that CD that you were teasing out last week well we're not gonna disclose it here this morning as to the content of it and I think the reason why I'm not going to do it this morning and the reason why you didn't hear from her last night about it is because we're in the process of we're in the middle of a lawsuit a legal fight and we're gonna run strategic and in surgical in the way that we go about this I understand that said 60 minutes on there suggesting that you were gonna reveal the contents of that in 60 minutes no I think I made it clear in the in the appearances that followed that that was a warning shot to the president and mr. Cohen relating to the fact that if they were going to come out after the show and declare that this did not happen or call my client a liar that there were gonna be consequences and what's interesting is is that we haven't heard from him this morning I mean we they haven't denied the affair they haven't denied the fact that the president knew about the agreement they haven't denied the fact that he knew about the hundred thirty thousand well they're threatening you they're threatening you they're threatening your clients so release its if you were holding that to have leverage over them in case they threatened you game on they threatened you so what's on the CD well again I'm not gonna answer what's on the CD but why don't they come forward and answer questions like I'm here answering about what they knew and when they knew it I think it's pretty clear that my client is very very credible it's pretty clear they've been lied to by mr. Cohen and it's pretty clear that Donald Trump is covering this up well so what are you waiting for what is the trigger that has you releasing the physical evidence we're going to release that well first of all we've already released some physical evidence we've released emails we've released documents there's more coming down the pike we're in the very early stages of this we're gonna be methodical and surgical in the way that we go about it right but you you showed the CD and you teased that you had information on there and just again what you got to have a strategy what's the triggering point for you to go ahead and tell everybody show the world what's on that CD what are you what has to happen first as you said that they had to threaten you well they've already threatened you well again I'd be a pretty good no I didn't say they had to threaten me what I said was they should not deny the affair or that it took place and if they did so there'd be consequences but I want to be a very good attorney if I laid out on MSNBC this morning our strategy as to when we're going to release evidence and what our strategy is going to be legally now would I well but what does that have to do you're teasing it no no no not team what do what which is that that wait what does that have to do evidences evidence is evidence what does that have to do with your legal strategy again I'm not teasing anything there is a everybody wants a media gratification and everything in life right now well guess what I can happen no let me show you counselor Exhibit A this is your own tweet yeah you said hey look at this world if a picture's worth a thousand words how many words is this worth with how many question works after it and then you have 60 minutes press that is you teasing it up that is you tell it baiting the public that is you telling everybody hey look what I've got look what's coming did it doesn't matter how many times you ask me the question I'm not gonna tell you what's on the CD or the DVD now do you want to talk about the content of the interview you want to talk about the the sending of the goon to the car door with the little girl in the back seat you want to talk about where's the president that's next Michael but the first thing I want to know is they just I'm just trying to figure out why you tease that and then didn't follow through with the content so what's the trigger for when we find out what's on the CD I answered the questions I'm not going to answer any further okay so let's go now to the next question which is about the threat the goon comes up in the car and threatens her Anderson Cooper didn't ask about the physical description of the person who threatened her for some reason can you tell us what he looked like I cannot but my client certainly can she she can describe him in great detail I think it's important for that your viewers know the original interview of my client for 60 minutes was about two hours in length I was there for the entirety of it there was a lot of things that were cut out in preparation of the final piece we didn't have any editorial control over that obviously there were any details that were excluded and I think that many of those details ago surfaced in the coming weeks and months you know so she knows how he looks have you shown her pictures of people that have worked for Donald Trump has she identified the person that made the threat to you she has not identified the person as of yet we're in the process of trying to conclude exactly who that was I'm confident we're gonna get to the bottom of it there's no question that it could have only come from one place I mean it certainly didn't come from the magazine and it certainly didn't come from her so there's only one other party involved in this and and that's the Trump Organization will you seek phone records from the Trump Organization to try to figure out if some of Donald Trump's associates we're making calls to Las Vegas that week well we're gonna seek all kinds of records relating to this from them no doubt all right John Heilemann well Michael just did you go back to this question I mean just because of the history here right you were on the show when you first revealed the fact that she'd been physically threatened you said you know tune in to 60 minutes and we learned more about it we did learn some more about it in the terms of the details I'm not challenging that at all he just suggested that there was a two-hour long interview so I ask you now given the 60 minutes interviews now in our rear view mirror did she was she presented with photographic evidence was she asked to try to identify who the person was in the course of that interview and unaired portions of it no do you have any idea why that would be the case no have you had a discussion with her about the physical description of who threatened her well I'm not at liberty to get into the discussions that I've had with my client because that's privileged I have to be careful with that right well just me just are you saying you're not Liberty disclosure you saying you haven't had that discussion here's what I'll say in a case like this generally you would expect an attorney to have those communications with their client if the attorney was competent I think I'm a pretty competent guy without suggesting whether or not without asking you to name the person at this do you have a suspicion of who that beauty is that was personally identifiable to you do you have an idea in your head who it was the threaten her not yet not yet at this point so I'd like your this is not a question of privilege is a question of you've not at this moment your mind identified at prime culprit either the person who physically appeared at the car or who would have ordered her you don't know you don't have a sense of who that would have been I know you're suggesting that it was someone connected to Donald Trump at least in the background right well I think common sense dictates it I'm right who else would who else would have known of the impending story who else would have appeared or sent someone to appear at the car door I agree with you I I could get the suggestion and I get the application all I'm asking is whether you at this point in your mind have someone who you think is the prime candidate for who was behind that threat no okay really really it could be anyone in the world well I wouldn't say that it could be anywhere in the world I mean I think that she can describe that the culprit the perpetrator in great detail and again I don't think there's any question where this individual came from do you worry that by tweeting out the picture of that CD you overhyped what was going to be revealed in the interview oh thank you do you think you raise the expectations so high because yesterday you tweeted you kind of seemed to you know try to clamp down on the expectations for what the reveal would be no I think expectations generally got a little out of control quite honestly I don't think that me tweeting that CD had anything to do with it in fact the interviews that I gave on Friday made it clear that that the contents of that weren't going to necessarily be disclosed but I want to go back to some because I want to make sure I understand this sending someone to a card or a mother's card or let me finish a mother's card or with her baby in the backseat and stepping up on her and basically telling her that her life's in danger if she talks about mr. Trump that's not a big deal I mean have we gotten back up because that's exactly what I said because I think it's a big deal I'm following up with you because I believe she has such a strong case and is it necessarily in her interest from a communication standpoint to have her lawyer overhyping what the reveal is going okay I'm asking that because I think it's horrible right I don't think anything's been overhyped and I'll tell you what I'll put my conduct over the last three weeks as her counsel up against anybody else on the planet I think a lot of people have commented on the job that I've done for and I'll stand behind it what about the market lawyer that he that she had there's something fishy with that why that first relationship was there any relationship with the Trump Organization and how that counsel ended up representing miss Daniels I'll be honest with you I think there's a lot of very very tough questions relating to that relationship and and relating to that issue and that's all I'm going to say about it hey Michael let me ask you a couple of follow-ups one on the alleged threat she has she got a good look at the man I assume it was a man she got a good look at the man and she can identify features of that man yes and in fact what she has said and this was cut out I'll share this with you that initially when she first saw him she was taken about how taken by how attractive he was and and she she you know was taken about how by how attractive he was and she immediately remembered what he looked like and then of course this threat happened and terrified her but I mean that's what she ain't say if she was sitting here she's very good so on this right so so she remembers him says she could remember him today if she saw him she didn't go to the police though before cuz she said she feared for her well-being correct correct have you taken her to the police since since we're where we are now it would make sense for her to actually go to the Clark County police and file a complaint now has she been taken there I'm not at liberty to discuss who we've discussed it with in law enforcement if any one at this juncture but would it not would it not make sense though that if she were threatened to go to the Las Vegas police with the Clark County police and file a complaint that her life is threatened it might let me ask you one other what why what well why wouldn't it just just let's just talk generally not but why would somebody not want to go to the police when their life was threatened well I'll tell you when you have a pending civil case sometimes you don't want to involve law enforcement because if law enforcement launches an investigation then witnesses start claiming the Fifth Amendment and in fact the opposing party can seek a stay in the civil case and so the case can go what's in what they call in the icebox the case could be delayed a year or two or three years while that investigation goes place so that's that's one example of why you might want to do that and there's others from a legal perspective jumpin okay let me ask you when you're standing before the judge and he asks you when you're saying Donald Trump didn't signed this deal so we don't have a valid in da the judge then turns to you and says well counselor your client took a hundred and thirty thousand dollars it was bailed enough already take the money what's your response to that my response is very clear it wasn't just about the hundred and thirty thousand dollars my client was to receive multiple other pieces of legal consideration beyond the hundred and thirty thousand dollars she was to receive a release from mr. Trump only mr. Trump could provide that she was to receive a representation relating to him staying away from her and her family only mr. Trump could provide that there's a whole host of other forms of consideration that my client never got we are highly confident this agreement is going to be thrown out it's trash it's not worth the paper it's printed on so it's thrown out she returns to 130,000 dollars sure absolutely we already offered to do that weeks ago yeah all right gentlemen I just want to ask you though just to go the $130,000 one of the other things we discussed when you were on the air the other day was mica had asked you about how that number got determined and you suggested in that conversation again that was something we'd learn more about in the sixty minutes interview it seems to me that that was not answered or really discussed in the interview last night so I'm curious as to whether a whether you can provide shed any more light on that how that number got how that number was arrived at between the parties well again at the time that I sat with you I knew the content of the full interview I didn't know which piece we're gonna make their way into the final underside a piece just stood but $130,000 I think was a was a number that was provided by mr. Cohen right so you're like because it wasn't in the interview lies and I'm just curious whether that was a single single offers he was she was offered 130 she took that number or was that arrived at through negotiation I mean the number again to bhoomika spoink that day seems like a low number given the range of these kinds of settlement number so there's still some curiosity I think on people's part is how did you end up at a number that seems so small given the political volatility the situation given how closer was the election given hell obviously the president now president wanted to keep her quiet it seems like she could have driven a harder bargain and gotten a lot more money than that so it's kind of raises questions about how it ended up being that low well I think it raises some of the questions that your colleague raised earlier relating to her prior representation I was not involved in those negotiations right one simple question where do you go from here with this yeah well again as I think we've made clear I mean we're only getting started we are going to get discovery in this case we're gonna get to the bottom of what mr. Trump knew and when he knew it and whether he knew about the agreement and where this 130 thousand dollar payment came from and I think as you saw the expert stayed on 60 minutes this has serious consequences this just isn't about sex in a hotel room in Lake Tahoe that that's not it's not what about that this is about the cover-up it's about mr. Cohen lying to the American people about this agreement and the fact that mr. Trump didn't know anything about it I mean the idea let me say this the idea that mr. Cohen drafted an agreement entirely on his own without any knowledge of mr. Trump and he never expected mr. Trump to ever know anything about it then why did he put mr. Trump in the agreement and why is there a signature line for mr. Trump if he never thought mr. Trump was ever going to know about the agreement it makes no sense that this is this is a lie but it's not a good lie and we're gonna get to the bottom of it and we're gonna blow it out of the water for the American people and when the truth comes out the truth is gonna be very very ugly for mr. Cohen and the president what's the level of confidence you have and maybe deposing Donald Trump at some point very very high really really we're not gonna need much time we're gonna need probably two hours or less these were very straightforward questions I noticed that he tweeted this morning why doesn't he just tweet if in fact he claims this to be true why doesn't he tweet she was never in his hotel room he never had sex with her he never knew anything about the agreement he never knew anything about 130 thousand dollars you know he sends out the surrogate on network television yesterday to call this a hoax yeah it's a hoax it's a hoax like 9/11 and the moon landing that's the kind of hoax it is Jo it is it's true Michael we have commented that Donald Trump has attacked just about everybody in public life but he's never attacked your client and obviously he has his concerns I'm wondering again I just just going back to 30,000 feet for people that are trying to follow all of this what does your client want at the end of the day why is she doing this well at this point she wants the truth and nothing but the truth to be laid bare for the American people the American people deserve to know what happened with this agreement whether mr. Trump knew about it whether he knew about 130,000 dollars and what happened in connection with that payment she wants the line what she wants to Joe she wants the lies and the deception and the games to stop this is a very simple matter when you really get down to it and and why does that matter well it should matter to all Americans it should matter to all Americans but what does that matter what does that matter to her it's a possibility to stick her neck out and and go through this and as she said have her family go through this why does this matter to her it matters to her Joe because months ago when mr. Cohen gave his initial statement to The Wall Street Journal and followed that up with information that was disseminated through the press that that information of those statements were false about her she's upset about it she's angry about it and she didn't deserve to be treated that way and that's why it matters to her Joe all right Michael thank you so much thank you with us greatly appreciate it all right thank you thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more four Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
