you know the one very strange thing that I've been thinking about on the 17th anniversary of 9/11 as a parent of young children and the thing that comes to mind is that is that my kids will grow up seeing 9/11 as this kind of event from the ancient past right something from something from which they are they are detached kind of like how I saw when I was a kid growing up I remember when I when I learned about the Vietnam War or the Cold War the JFK assassination when I was a kid all those events were relatively recent to me you know they happen not long before my birth and my parents remembered them and told me about them but still it just felt like something like something ancient and that's how things that happened before you were born I guess always feel at least in modern society that's how they feel I think maybe back back in the old days people felt more connected to the past even the past the things that happened before they were born but in this modern day and age when news moves so quickly and I don't know we're just so immersed in things that are happening around us we're so immersed kind of in in the present and we have all this information coming at us all the time we're so aware of everything that's happening in the world so it makes it harder for us to feel connected to the past and so that that's how it's kind of strange that's the perspective that my kids will have of 9/11 because it was an event that was it was a probably the defining event for my generation I remember I was a freshman in high school when 9/11 happened and everything changed after that in fact it's very sad I was also thinking about this the other day for me in my generation I was thinking like what are the three what are the three defining events for for my generation people who are you know in their late 20s early 30s right now and what I'm talking about national events not personal events and so for me those three events very easily very very clearly would be there was first there was Columbine which which happened when I was in Middle School and we're sadly so used to school shootings now but when that happened it was it was unprecedented at least it felt unprecedented and it just changed change school it changed for from then on out school just felt different and there was this feeling of unease in danger that you had in school that never really went away after that and then 9/11 which like I said happened I think it was ninth and tenth grade would that happen and then for me the last thing being as I grew up in Maryland the last defining event was the DC sniper which I guess if you were in other parts of the of the country so that was more just like a news item but around where I lived it was a very terrifying time for a couple of for a couple of weeks where you legitimately thought that you might get shot when you're walking to the bus stop or when you come out of your house because that's what was happening and so I was thinking about how much fear anxiety suspicion all of those things those defining event events infused not just into me personally but into everyone who was growing up around that time so it's kind of sad that I I think every generation has tragic events that are defining for them but I also think that some generations have also great you know tremendous spectacular events that are also defined anything about the moon-landing you know for my grandparents generation but so far I don't know if we really have anything like that at least for me growing up all the all the big news events the defining ones you throw the Iraq war in there as well I mean there were all terrible things right so in that sense I'm I'm glad that that had happened long before my kids were born because I don't really want something like that to be a defining event for them but in another sense in other sense considering 9/11 was a defining national event I don't want my kids to feel completely disconnected from it either though inevitably they will
