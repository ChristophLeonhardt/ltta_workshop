Trump is once again defending his administration's response to the hurricane aftermath and Porter weeks either so I'm gonna miss on Twitter you are gonna miss it though so much not a short time ago three thousand people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico when I left the island after the storm had hit that anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths as time went by did not go up by much then a long time later they started to report really large there you really like 3,000 and now there's a second part of the tweet because he can't help him so you're really kidding me this was done by the Democrats in order to make me look bad as as bad as possible when I was successfully raising billions wait is he saying Democrats killed 3,000 were Tory concen died for any reason like old age just add them on to the list bad politics I love Puerto Rico well that lets people die because they weren't getting dialysis and we will die neighborhoods that you have water working medical it's a reminder but any paper towels thrown at them they needed health lights water yeah and by the waiters a year in still 50% of the island did not have electricity 50% of the island did not have water drinkable water the healthcare conditions were absolutely horrid and Donald Trump didn't focus on it they would have said Americans instead of Puerto Ricans then he would have focused on truck he just doesn't care realize that point Ricans actually are Americans thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more 4 Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
