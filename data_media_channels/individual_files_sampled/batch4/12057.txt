with our host Alicia Krause our live Q&A is available on YouTube and Facebook for everybody to watch only subscribers get to ask questions over at daily wire.com check out our pin comments on this video for more information so go check that out right now alrighty so the big news of the day is that apparently Donald Trump hates children now if you're on the left this comes as no surprise because you always thought that Donald Trump hated children right I mean that's not a giant shock but the reality is that Donald Trump supposedly is a guy who wants to remove children from the arms of their parents as those parents cross the border illegally so you're coming across the border to make a new life for yourself and you brought your child and you're picked up by ice and they cruelly take those children and they rip them away from you they take the children they just they rip them away from you okay there is only one problem with all of this okay there's only one problem with all of this this is just not the case okay the reason I say this is just not the case I'm gonna go through the actual applicable law here so you know what it is that is going on okay the reality is that the law requires that if you cross the border illegally and we arrest you for it that your children cannot stay in custody with you hey that's just the way it is okay the way that it is according to the law okay and that is a that is a 2008 ruling from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals according to the law you are not allowed to take the children and leave them with their parents in custody is the Ninth Circuit Court ruled that non detention of minors applies to accompany two legal immigrants the reason this happened is there was an agreement it's called the Flores agreement back from the 1990s in which the federal government was sued and they came into a federal settlement and the federal settlement said that when unaccompanied illegal children come across the border they have to be released remanded into the custody of some sort of parental figure or guardian in the United States and then the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2016 ruled that those children actually had to be released whether or not they came with a parent so you come across with mommy and daddy we still cannot keep you in custody for a long period of time we still have to release you ASAP now the problem with this is this has created a spate of headlines that Donald Trump because he is more strictly enforcing border laws that because he is doing that this means that you aren't that he is somehow separating the children from their parents again it is by operation of law that the kids are removed from their parents it is not Donald Trump decided I want to remove children from their parents and therefore I'm cruel and nasty and that's what I want to do that's not how any of this works rich Lowry has a good column making all of this clear he points out in his column a National Review today the Trump administration is not changing the rules that pertain to separating an adult from a child those remain the same separation happens only if officials find that the adult is falsely claiming to be the child's parent or as a threat to the child or is put into criminal proceedings and it's the last that is operative here the past practice had been to give a free pass to an adult who's part of a family unit the new Trump policy is to prosecute all adults the idea is to send a signal that we are serious about our laws and to create a deterrent against reentry illegal entry is a misdemeanor illegal reentry however is a felony when a migrant is prosecuted for illegal entry rights rich Lowry here she has taken into custody by the u.s. marshals in no circumstance anywhere in the United States do the marshals care for the children of people they take into custody the child is taken into the custody of HHS that's Health and Human Services who cares for them at temporary shelters the criminal proceedings are exceptionally short assuming there is no aggravating factor such as a prior illegal entity or another crime the migrants generally plead guilty and they are then sentenced to time served typically on the same day although practices vary along the border after this their returns the custody of ice for deportation if the adult then wants to go home in keeping with the expedited order of removal that is issued as a matter of course it's relatively simple the adult has reunited quickly with his or her child and the family returned home his unit in this scenario there's only a brief separation when it does become more of an issue is when parents start claiming asylum if you claim asylum adults are going to be detained longer and the law is that you are not allowed to hold children for longer than 20 days in custody and that's the Flores consent decree now ruling by the Ninth Circuit extended the 20-day limit to children who come as part of family Union so even if you would like to hold the family unit together even if you want the kid to stay with mommy and daddy you cannot by operation of law you are forbidden from doing so because the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals wanted to make it less appealing for the government to keep families in custody they wanted all of these families released into the general population in the United States rich Lowry writes the clock ticking on the time the government can hold the child will almost always run out before an asylum claim is settled the migrants is allowed ten days to seek an attorney there may be continuances or other complications this creates the choice of either releasing the adults and the children together into the country pending the adjudication of the asylum claim or holding the children holding the adults and releasing the children if the adult has held HHS places that came with a responsible party in the in the US ideally a relative even if Flores didn't exist the government would be very constrained and how many family units it can accommodate ice only has about 3,000 family spaces and shelters it is also limited in its overall space at the border which is overwhelmed by the ongoing influx so family units can go home quickly all they have to do is not plead asylum and they can all go home together also there's a better way to claim asylum so the separation of parents from children only happens if you are arrested if you walk up to a border station in the United States you don't go between border stations you just walk up to for example the us-mexico border you know down near San Diego if you just walk up to that border and you say I need to claim asylum you will not be arrested you are only arrested if you try to cross between the borders because then the idea is probably you're lying to get into the country otherwise you should just walk up to Border Patrol not along the border but in specific border stations which everybody knows where they are and then you claim asylum and then you're not arrested at all then you get to stay with your kids right every indication is that the migrant flow to the United States is discretionary it nearly dried up at the beginning of the Trump administration when migrants believed they had no chance of getting into the United States now it's going in earnest again because the message got out that despite the rhetoric the policy at the border hasn't actually changed even if a migrant does have credible fear of persecution rights Lowry there is a legitimate way to pursue that claim it is not involved entering the United States illegally first such people should make their asylum claim in the first country where they feel safe I for example Mexico second if for some reason they are threatened everywhere but the United States they should show up at a port of entry that's what it's called the technical term a port of entry and they make their claim there rather than crossing the border illegally there's significant moral cost to not enforcing the border as well as rich Lowry points out if you just start releasing people in general into the middle of the country lots more people are going to start crossing into the country illegally and it is well worth pointing out that under the Obama administration and under the Bush administration really immigration surges were rooted in government policy so July 7th 2014 this is from the New York Times it was one of the final pieces of legislation signed into law by President George W Bush a measure that passed without controversy along with a pension bill and another one calling for national parks to be commemorated on quarters this is a piece of legislation we're very proud to sign a White House spokesman Tony Fratto told reporters December 28th 2008 this program has been very effective around the world in trying to stop trafficking in persons now the legislation this is the New York Times right not Breitbart not in a right-wing publication now the legislation enacted quietly during the transition to the Obama administration is at the root of the potentially calamitous flow of unaccompanied minors to the nation's southern border originally pushed by a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers as well as by evangelical groups to combat sex trafficking the bill gave substantial new protections to children entering the country alone who are not from Mexico or Canada by prohibiting them from being quickly sent back to their country of origin instead they have an opportunity to appear in an immigration hearing and consult with an advocate this of course with Langston it puts strains on the system lengthens the amount of time that these kids are in the system in the first place so they're a bunch of lies that are being told right now and we'll go through a lot of the lies that are being told by the media in just a second but some of the lies being told her that Trump is randomly deciding to separate kids at the border he doesn't have to do that he does have to do that by operation of law the only thing the Trump administration is doing differently is they are treating everyone who is crossing the border illegally as an illegal immigrant for prosecution for purposes of prosecution and then because you're doing that the kids can't stay in custody with the parents longer than 20 days and that is operation of law once again now the media are going nuts over all of this and they are they're making a huge fuss out of all of this and they're showing up at the border and they are showing up at these at these particular at these particular border stations where the kids are being held the kids are being held separately in what are cages essentially now when they say cages it makes it sound like the you know it's like a chicken coop like it's tiny it isn't but of course technically their cage is because it's chain-link fence separating people so though the administration is tried to fight back against the cages the cages descriptor saying the kids are being treated pretty well the kids are being treated by some accounts well by some accounts not as well apparently one of the regulations on the books is that federal employees are not allowed to touch the kids for a fear of lawsuit so that means that some of the illegal immigrant children are changing the diapers and let other illegal immigrant children they don't even know the conditions are not good all of this is underfunded Congress could solve all of this by the way and Congress could solve all of this today all they have to do is pass a law that says that if you come into the country illegally with your parents your parents and you get to stay together where you get to stay in custody together right that would be the way that you fix this law and then it's the parents option whether they want the kids released to the custody of the HHS or released to the custody of a family member already in the United States but they get to stay with the parents otherwise right Congress can do that tomorrow and Congress should do that today or tomorrow apparently I'm hearing from the speaker's office from speaker Ryan's office that's exactly what speaker Ryan is going to pursue plus funding for expanded facilities to ensure that parents can stay together with their kids when they come across the border so all of this is in the process of getting solved I do find it somewhat suspicious that the media have decided to jump both feet on the bandwagon as though this is some sort of great Human Rights catastrophe brought on by the Trump administration when of course all of this started under the Obama administration or at least it was happening under the Obama administration Brandon Darby from Breitbart he had a bunch of photos I remember when I was working at Breitbart so he put out all these photos right these are all photos of a bunch of people including children who are at these detention facilities doesn't look that great right man this is from 2014 you can see all the photos is from 2014 and it's children who are separated from males who are separated from females these facilities are overcrowded right all this was happening in 2015 there's nothing new happening here but the implication is there's something new happening here because it's Trump and that of course is not true right that's just not true we're gonna get to the media coverage of this in just a second talk about the administration's response and really what the administration did do wrong in just a second first I want to say thanks to our sponsors over at wink so all of this makes you want to drink doesn't it I mean politics it's not the kind of thing that

Trump administration with all this set that the Trump administration is basically following the law and if you don't like the law change the law administration to do a couple of things wrong here so the first thing they did wrong is they sent out Stephen Miller and John Kelly to say incredibly dumb things so Stephen Miller who's sort of the president's immigration guru I know Stephens I know Stephen I think Stephens a nice guy but Stephen made the big boo-boo I'm going out in public and saying that we want to use the separation of children from parents as a deterrent to prevent people from crossing the border he should not be using the suffering of children as a deterrent to keep parents from crossing the border that's not the way to do this to turn to crossing the border is that you get sent back it should not be then you take kids away from their parents this causes psychological harm and psychological damage it shouldn't be a situation as we've heard from some of these reports where the parents aren't even told that they're being separated from the kids the kids are sort of taken away and then two hours later the parents are so yeah by the way you're not gonna be able to see your kid again right that kind of stuff is a problem and that kind of stuff is frightening it should not be happening in the United States to say that you're using that as a deterrent effect that's a serious problem and that should not be done that's stupid Jeff Sessions also came out and he quoted the Bible he said listen the Bible says that you should abide by the law I would cite you to the Apostle Paul and his clear and wise command in Romans 13 - oh babe laws of the government because God is obtained ok so again and I know senator sessions or you know attorney general sessions and I think on some of his immigration policy he's been exactly right you probably shouldn't be grinning so broadly when you talk about separating families from their children it's just not smart if you for folks you can't see the video you know he's he's standing there and he's green pretty broadly he quotes the Apostle Paul again you don't have to do that just say abide by the laws of this country this is a very serious topic obviously well the homeland security secretary secretary Brigitte Nielsen our sorry Christian Nielsen she has come forward and she says that the the reporters and and by members of Congress the reporting is not true on this and she's correct she says this misreporting by members press and advocacy groups must stop and is irresponsible and unproductive as I have said many times before if you are seeking asylum from your family there's no reason to break the law and illegally cross between ports of entry this is exactly right right now the policy is if you cross between ports of entry we will arrest you and will prosecute you but if you show up at one of the border ports of entry then you'll be treated as an asylum seeker you won't be separated from your kids and she continues she says you're not breaking the law by seeking asylum in a port of entry and she continues as well and she says for those seeking asylum at ports of entry we have continued the policy from previous administrations and will only separate if the child is in danger there's no custodial relationship between family members or if the adult has broken a law and she finishes up for those she says DHS takes very seriously its duty to protect minors in our temporary custody from gangs traffickers criminals and abuse and then she finishes by saying we do not have a policy of separating families at the border period everything she says there is factually true now the media are lying about this and in just a second I'm gonna show you how the media are lying about all of this and turning it into a major issue when in fact this is an easily solvable issue if we could just get past all the politics so we begin with Chuck Todd so Chuck Todd has on Kellyanne Conway and NBC News on Sunday and he says that the goal of the Trump administration is to hold children to hold hold children hostage to get Democrats to pass some law that obviously is not the goal here the operation of law the operation of law it's not up to trump the operation of law says that if you arrest a parent illegally crossing the border the kid cannot be held in custody for longer than 20 days that is the law Trump did not make up the law Trump cannot violate that law unless he just decides to release illegal immigrant parents who are crossing between border ports of entry illegally yeah all the lies that are being told today are really astonishing and Chuck Todd for words that game here and this is gonna sound harsh but it sounds like you're holding these kids hostage to get the Democrats to the table to pass some law you just laid out a very compassionate case for why I understand you just let a very competitive with a lot of compassion and a lot of empathy in there but it's not very empathetic than the most traumatic thing to do to a kid separate them from their parents okay so what's your solution Chuck so what's your solution Chuck right this is the part that's that makes me crazy the solution that is being proposed by people on the Left said that Trump should just release people into the interior of the United States that is the solution that they are proposing right now that is not a solution there are laws on the books you do not gets crossed into the country illegally again we have provisions that say if you come to a port of entry in the United States then we will treat you like a normal asylum seeker if however you are sneaking through the brush near Sonoma and you just decide to to cross the border illegally not near a port of entry and we catch you we're not going to treat you as though you were an asylum seeker because if your Asylum seeker you were to go onto a port of entry right but the media are just lying flat out about this I will say I thought that the most hilarious things after Jeff Sessions quoted the Bible to say that people should abide by the law MSNBC decided to ask what would Jesus do so apparently Trump has now won the war on Christmas Trump has officially won the war on Christmas because he's got the anchors at MSNBC actually reading the Bible I do enjoy when folks on the Left start reading the Bible and they skip over all the parts about you know like abortion and same-sex marriage and adultery and they skip over all of those parts and they go straight to the most vague portions that support their position so here's Ali Velshi on MSNBC who I guess went to some sort of seminary and he did a full segment on MSNBC called what would Jesus do about illegal immigration but jesus said suffer little children and forbid them not to come unto me for of such is the kingdom of heaven what is that's the only little grain in Matthew chapter 25 again this time verse 40 and the King shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto you in Doha CNN MSNBC they have done it unto one of the least of my brethren ye have done it unto me that's just a small sampling of what's in the Bible well hallelujah MSNBC calling out the priests and the pastor's to talk about everything that's going on on the border again you're not gonna see them do this with regard to Planned Parenthood that was the most ironic tweeting all this Planned Parenthood tweeted this out so here's a Planned Parenthood tweeted they tweeted out in our hearts and minds today all of the fathers and parents have been separated from their children at borders keep families together hashtag Father's Day and then it says you deserve to be together regardless of immigration status keeping families together is reproductive justice you kill babies okay that's what Planned Parenthood does for a living three hundred thousand unborn children a year and whatever you may say about separating families from children at the border and again I think there's an easy congressional fix to all of this that speaker Ryan's offices told me they're already pursuing today you know even if you believe that that's something that ought to be fixed what Planned Parenthood's does to kids a lot worse than separating them at the border for a week and a half okay they kill them so I do love how the left suddenly is interested in God in the Bible when it comes to illegal immigration by the way I just want to note this you know and someone who's fond of the Old Testament right I wear the funny hat on my head I'm fond of the Old Testament and I like it in the original Hebrew you know the hardcore way and whenever it talks about treating strangers in your land with certain respect the precondition in all of Jewish law for all the Jewish histories that people have to accept the law of land if you violate the law of land you're not treated like a stranger in the land like a garret aschoff right you instead are treated like somebody who is violating the laughlin were treated like a criminal so to misquote the Bible purposefully is really ridiculous now the worst of all is Kathy Griffin of course because Kathy Griffin only makes a headline when she says something absolutely awful so she decided that she would go off on on Melania she said f you Melania you know damn well your husband can end this immediately feckless complicit piece of bleep I do love that so many folks on the left are so angry all the women in the Trump administration they're feckless and complicit but so funny all those people wouldn't say that Hillary Clinton was feckless and complicit when it came to her husband's exploitation of women but it's a different thing when you're talking immigration policy and Melania Trump like Melania is just going to stroll on into the Oval and suddenly trump's gonna shift his immigration policy cuz Melania said something now really the routine that is making the most that is making the most headlines today is Laura Bush has an op-ed today that we need to go through in just a second plus you have a bunch of preening Democratic lawmakers I want to talk about first I want to say thanks to our sponsors over at stamps

this stuff it's just great go to stamps comm check it out and use promo code Shapiro to let them know we sent you and so you got the special deal all right so Laura Bush has now sounds it off now I do find this weird okay I really like Laura Bush I have a lot of respect for Laura Bush I think choose a very good first lady but I don't know why it was that Laura Bush was silent about so much of policy under the Obama administration and now she is speaking out about the Trump administration I suppose the idea here is that Republicans are supposed to police their own so when something really bad happens Republicans are supposed to speak up that's fine with me but I think that this particular piece is not supremely accurate and not only do I think that it's not supremely accurate I think that it actually forward some falsehoods so here's what Laura Bush has to station is on Sunday a day we as a nation set aside to honor fathers and the bonds of family I was among the millions of Americans who watched images of children who have been torn from their parents in the six weeks between April 19th and May 31st the Department of Homeland Security has sent nearly 2,000 children to mass detention centers or foster care more than 100 of these children are younger than four years old the reason for these separations is a zero-tolerance policy for their parents who are accused of illegally crossing our borders well they're not accused they illegally crossed our borders and I live in a border state I appreciate the need to enforce and protect our international boundaries but the zero tolerance policy is cruel it is immoral and it breaks my heart so again here's the problem I understand empathy empathy makes for bad politics it does ok sympathy makes for good politics empathy makes for bad politics sympathy is I feel bad for you empathy is I feel you meaning I am putting myself in your shoes well how about putting yourself in the shoes of the immigration agent who has to decide whether to release an unvetted illegal immigrant family into the country ok there are stories by the way of gangs who have been smuggling children across the border specifically for this purpose because they know that if they have a kid with them they're more likely to be released into sort of general sight now it's rarity but it is happening and we have to be vetting who comes into the country in the first place is the policy supposed to be that you show up with a six-month-old then we just release you into the country because right now that's the law right now you have two choices I can either arrest the parent and separate out the kid or I can release them into the country if the idea is you come in with a kid under 4 you get released how many people do you think are gonna rush that border a lot a lot of people does not say you should create a policy to deter aggression by separating the kids instead you should change the power see so the kids get to stay with the parents in some sort of custody that'd be the way to do this but if the alternative is released a bunch of kids in the middle of the country with their parents I just don't see that here's what Laura Bush read she's our government should not be in the business of warehousing children in converted box stores or making plans to place them in tent cities in the desert outside El Paso these images are eerily reminiscent of the Japanese internment camps of World War two now considered to have been one of the most shameful episodes in American history we also know this treatment inflicts trauma in turn Japanese have been 2 times as likely to suffer cardiovascular disease or die prematurely than those who are not interred this is not Japanese American internment okay that was taking American citizens and forcibly relocating them to camps when they were integrated into American society already they had rights under the US Constitution the same is not true of people illegally crossing the border and again it was the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals the most left Court in America that made this policy it was not Trump I don't like the inaccuracy here he can make a case for legislation that fixes all of this without being inaccurate about your reporting Laura Bush continues Americans pride ourselves on being a moral nation on being the nation that sends humanitarian relief to places devastated by natural disasters or famine or war we pride ourselves on believing that people should be seen for the content of their character not the color of their skin we pride ourselves on acceptance if we are truly that country then it is our obligation to reunite these detained children with their parents and to stop separating parents and children in the first place people on all sides agree our immigration system isn't working but the injustice of zero tolerance is not the answer I moved away from Washington almost a decade ago but I know there are good people at all levels of government who can do better to fix all of this says in 2018 can we not find an it and can we not as a nation find a kinder more compassionate and more moral answer to this current crisis I for one believe we can yes of course we can but this starts by not being inaccurate about the state of law it starts by not being accurate about the state law it also starts by not being at inaccurate about illegal immigration and the cost of illegal immigration now there's been a lot of talk about illegal immigration increasing crime rates the data are mixed on all of that there's been a lot of talk about illegal immigration and its effects on the economy the evidence suggests that the illegal immigrants are more of a drain on the economy that helps the economy since they don't pay taxes they paste you know state sales tax but that's about it but it is certainly true that every crime that is committed by an illegal immigrant inside the United States is a crime that didn't need to happen for example over the weekend all he said five undocumented immigrants are dead following a chase involving Border Patrol agents on Sunday afternoon Dimmick County Sheriff Marion Boyd said the crash happened off highway 85 in big wells in about noon Boyd said agents were chasing the SUV but it lost control it overturned the vehicle was traveling at more than a hundred miles per hour when it crashed 14 people were inside including the driver and passenger 12 immigrants were ejected four died at the scene when the car crashed and rolled over according to Boyd a fifth person later died at the hospital a total of nine people were transported to the hospital including five who went to San Antonio Military Medical Center the restaurants and local hospitals the driver is a United States citizen who was among those transported a Border Patrol agent observed three vehicles traveling one behind the other on FM in 2664 and suspected a smuggling attempt was happening the agency said in a statement the agent was able to stop one of the vehicles and called out a description of the other two a second Border Patrol agent was able to pull over the second vehicle the third refused to stop the agents he said multiple arrests were made in both vehicles the passenger also believed to be a US citizen is currently in custody Boyd says they need a wall built in this area because this is a real problem in the area okay so well there's a lot of talk about weakening immigration law you know we ought to remember that a country worth its salt does have borders now lawmakers are making hay while the Sun shines here smart politicians Michael Hayden General Michael Hayden who is a member of the Obama administration I believe I would have to actually look up his credentials but Michael Hayden tweeted this out like Laura Bush you know trying to compare all of this to internment camps Michael Hayden then tweeted out a picture of the railway station at Auschwitz Riley cash was Birkenau any tweet our other governments have separated mothers and children this is so insulting and so insanely stupid I can't even tell you it is bad enough to compare this to japanese-american internment camps because it is not similar okay it isn't but to compare it to the Nazis is just insane he's a retired US Air Force four-star general he's former Director of National Security Agency and former director of the CIA is Michael Hayden the the fact that he thinks this just demonstrates the lack of knowledge and all levels of the American government there was separation of children from parents at Auschwitz and then both were gassed and then they gassed every child to death and they gassed most of the mothers to death as well that is not the same thing as we're going to put you in protective custody while we take care of your parents asylum claim not quite the same thing at all but it's just it's just ridiculous again all this media coverage is ridiculous all of it is unfair and all of it

sports columnist will talk sports and everything else so check that out as well we are the largest fastest growing conservative podcast in the nation so among all of these stupid responses to this immigration debacle is Bill Clinton so Bill Clinton responded to all of us because we obviously mean his take on the immigration situation he tweeted out on this Father's Day I'm thinking of the thousands of children separated from their parents at the border honestly I thought on Father's Day he might be thinking of all the children he's never met that he has you know this Father's Day I'm thinking of thousands of children separated from their parents bore these children should not be a negotiating to and reuniting them with their families would reaffirm America's belief in and support for all parents who love their children ok well I seem to remember back to the 90s you know like flashback back to the 90s remember this picture remember this one yeah yeah that was when they took Elian Gonzales from his family at gunpoint and then sends him back to Cuba right because we had to have good relations with Cuba is very important so we actually sent a SWAT team in for a move Elian Gonzalez from the United States but apparently on Father's Day this is what Bill Clinton doesn't remember I bill clinton amidst his hookers and blow he's sitting around thinking about all of the children separate from their parents at the border all of this is just overwrought and has nothing to do with the actual law again there will be a law passed this week to fix this process as well there should have been before now I'm glad there's focus on it because I think the process ought to be fix but there's no reason to lie about it and you see all these lawmakers who are lying about it here in lawmakers holding a press conference after touring in the immigration facility there's representative Sheila jackson-lee one of the greater demagogues in the country Democrat from Texas and here she is making making the fuss let me just quickly say that when you have a mother tell you directly that she's in fear that she will never see her child again when the United Nations Human Rights Commission indicates to the Trump administration you're violating Human Rights then you know that what we are saying today is President Trump cease and desist because you are moving the arc of Justice to the heat of despair and the trash heap of injustice so after the parents are in handcuffs their kids are taken away to parts unknown that is appalling it is an American as Peter Walter Democrat from Vermont heap of despair and trash heap of history and arcs of justice and oh my goodness okay if you're a parent and you feel like you're never gonna get your kid back that's horrifying obviously which is why we should correct the situation it is also that every child has been returned to their parent has it been a case where a kid has been permanently removed from their parent have we heard of any of those cases no because this is all exaggeration okay now again the policy is not good but this policy was not implemented by the Trump administration all they're doing is enforcing the immigration law that's it that's the whole thing okay but it's just it's it's so irritating to watch people fib and lie about the situation and this stuff is it's just it's fibs and it's lies and it's inappropriate to fibbin lie about politics even if you think that it's gonna be helpful these are the same people who say the Trump lies routinely well the media are lying about the situation and it's really really unpleasant okay now speaking of unpleasant Peter struck you'll recall last week we talked at length about the Department of Justice Inspector General report about the FBI's actions in the Hillary Clinton email case and that IG report was pretty damning the person at the center of the IG report was Peter struck Peter struck was an FBI agent who was one of the head agents in charge of both the Russia investigation as well as the Hillary Clinton email investigation and you'll recall that there was a text that he sent to his lover he's a delightful fellow who's married having an affair with a woman who's also married so just delightful people all the way around and she texted that Trump wouldn't be President she hopes basically and he said we'll stop it write those direct quote we'll stop it which is just fantastic so now struck says that he will testify before the House Judiciary Committee without a subpoena according to his lawyer 8:00 in Berlin he wrote the House Judiciary Committee chairman Bob Goodlatte a letter obtained by law and crime quote I have read press reports that you're initiating the process to issue a subpoena to Special Agent struck to testify before your committee well you are of course free to continue pursuing this process it is wholly unnecessary specialist special agent struck who's been fully cooperative with the DOJ Office of Inspector General intends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other congressional committee that invites him so the reason that he's so eager to get in front of the committee obviously is because he can fib about all of this he can just say when I said we'll stop it I mean all of the anti-trump voters right that's really what I meant or when I said that I don't want Trump to be President you know I was gonna use my official auspices to do all of this or when I decided that I was going to delay the decision-making about Hillary Clinton's email investigation to pursue the Russian investigation which is what happened between late September and late October and when I made that decision that wasn't politically motivated after all if I were politically motivated I would released all this stuff to the press already said all this stuff to the goj and the DOJ itself found some of this stuff not incredible at the DOJ itself said that it had problems with struct story that had thought that it cast really bad light on the FBI's actions in the Hillary Clinton email case on Thursday the DOJ z' office of the Inspector General blasted struck for his behavior amid the probes into Russia collusion and Hillary Clinton's emails to say they were ambivalent doesn't quite capture their tone on the one hand investigators said they found no evidence tying investigative decisions to anti-trump messages involving struck according to law and crime comm on the other hand quote when one senior FBI official struck will help lead the Russia investigation at the time conveys in a text message to another senior FBI official page that quote will stop candidate Trump from being elected after other extensive text messages between the two disparaging candidate Trump it is not only indicative of a bias state of mind but even more seriously implies a willingness to take official action to impact the president the presidential candidates electoral prospects this is antithetical to the core values of the FBI and the DOJ moreover as we described in Chapter nine in assessing Struck's decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following on the Hillary related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop in October 2016 these text messages led us to conclude we did not have confidence that structs decision was free from bias so how's the lawyer fighting back he says well special agent struck did not back burner inspection of the Weiner laptop in fall of 2016 second while special agent struck openly admitted he believed the Russian investigation was far more important to American national security than the Clinton email investigation this conclusion is evidence of special agents trucks lucidity not as bias I'm and so I guess struck is eager to testify because he's eager to grandstand about all of the Russian collusion that's supposedly going on now again there's been no actual evidence presented as of yet of anything beyond attempted collusion now attempted collusion ain't great but it ain't the same as actual collusion struck wants to get in front of Congress who wants to get in front of those cameras it needs to happen right and and here's the reality no matter what he says the left will claim that struck was acting in the best interests of the country and the right will suggest I think rightly so that bias was taking place with regard to the Russia investigation and the Hillary investigation bottom line is that struck is still working at the FBI how he has not been fired is absolutely beyond me it's absolutely beyond me no other area of American government would you be allowed to get away with this if you were a local police officer and there were a shooting and they found in your messages text messages about the person that you shot then about how you were eager to watch that person die right presumably you'd be prosecuted hey Peter struck basically did that with regard to the Trump investigation and we're all supposed to pretend that it didn't happen yeah that's ridiculous okay and now meanwhile speaking of ridiculous you know there's a lot of talk on college campuses these days about structural bias about racism institutional racism well now it turns out that Harvard University is institutionally racist so a group that is suing Harvard University is demanding that a publicly released admissions data on hundreds of thousands of applicants saying the records show a pattern of discrimination against asian-americans going back decades the group was able to view the documents through its lawsuit which was filed in 2014 and challenged ins Harvard's admissions policies basically what they found is that Harvard kept saying over and over and over that all Asian applicants were not good leaders basically they said that they were not good leaders or they had personal flaws and that's why they couldn't be admitted despite higher test scores and what you see is a bevy so the Caltech it's not fascinating chart of the weekend Caltech admits people simply on the basis of scores and on the basis of grades and what you saw is that the number of asian-americans at Caltech has been increasing dramatically over the past twenty years it started off at like at you know a certain level and then it rose dramatically to the point where it is now and it looks like a straight line up basically it's an arithmetic aliy increasing line well if you look at the the levels at Harvard what you see is a boost in the eighties of asian-american people attending Harvard and then it flattens out and the state of flat ever since the 90s and the same is held true at Yale and the same until true at NYU and the same is held true at most major college universities which suggests that there is racism going on and so the racism is coming from the left in the form of admissions bias to prevent asian-americans from getting into schools you want to talk about institutional racism we should be talking about institutional racism on the part of these universities now in other news on Father's Day well it's a good time to celebrate fathers the good news is that the left has decided that fathers are useless Noah Berle at ski is a columnist for NBC News and he writes for there think page this Father's Day men are experiencing a crisis of masculinity the solution more feminism yeah that's probably it yeah that'll probably fix it tell your boy that he that he oughta wear a tutu that's gonna fix it or tell your boy don't rape that's probably gonna fix this thing it's not that you need men modelling better behavior what you really need is men preaching the messages and Gloria Steinem that's definitely gonna solve things here's what the piece says we are experiencing a crisis of masculinity that's the claim of Canadian psychologist and self-help author Jordan Peterson Pearson argues that feminism and policies like no-fault divorce have destabilized traditional family and social structures has a fix for this Peterson recommends a variety of things including enforced monogamy a solution that implies men are oppressed due to lack of context consensual sex okay first of all that is a lie that we've talked about on the show before turn Peterson when he says enforced monogamy he does not mean government enforcement agha me he means a societal standard that promotes monogamy which I thought feminists would be for in many cases so that men wouldn't be scumbags cheating on them on a routine basis Peterson's claims have been broadly criticized but he does have his defenders as well he's often argued that the crisis of masculinity has been caused by feminism which has led to evolving norms generating confusion and mixed signals in the words of Cathy young writing in the LA Times feminism has sent men adrift they're no longer sure how to be men and as a result they are struggling economically and psychologically well that is kind of true but here's what Norbert Lansky says he says men experience violence and oppression because norms are not changing and it is in general powerful men who saw who enforce these unhelpful and sometimes dangerous masculine expectations not tyrannous feminist women as in one example consider male suicide rates men are victims of three-quarters of suicides in the United States this isn't because feminists have successfully carried out a campaign to keep men from having sex rather male suicide rates are tragically high because of traditional stereotypical standards of manliness well that's idiotic okay if that were really the case if you really believe that as traditional standards of stereotypical masculinity then why exactly has male suicide increased right if the standards were the same 50 years ago as they are today you would expect the suicide rate to be the same 50 years ago as it was today it isn't but Norbert alaskey has an idiotic point to make and here's the City otic point our culture tells men they are supposed to be emotionally and physically strong in self-contained it is not surprising therefore the men are less likely to seek medical help for mental health problems oh that's it that's it it's the men won't go to the doctor that's why they're dying in higher numbers sure they didn't go to the doctor fifty years ago but it's that they won't go to the doctor now encouraging boys not to cry as dangerous encouraging boys to love guns is even more so okay again loving guns has been part of male culture for as long as guns have been around and encouraging boys not to cry okay I don't think anybody should cry unless it is warranted boys or girls and then they didn't he talks about had gender expectations and stereotypical views of men mass incarceration disproportionately affects black people and people of color but it also and relatedly affects men well no it turns out that men have always gone to prison at higher rates because men are more aggressive biologically so in order to get to this idiotic point basically no Prelutsky has to suggest that the only thing that has changed is the men who become Moore's which is stupid and untrue and the other thing that has changed that societal standards have changed and this is making men more unhappy in certain ways and maybe we should take a look at the societal standards and determine whether they are useful or not and whether they are counterproductive or not okay time for some stuff I like and then some stuff I hate and then we'll do a Federalist paper so the thing I like today there's a I get a lot of questions about what kind of Jewish literature is worth reading there's an excellent book I finished over the weekend by Michael Goodman this this came out in Hebrew in Israel has been translated now it's called Maimonides and the book that changed Judaism secrets of the guides for the guide for the perplexed it really is a sophisticated take on guide for the perplexed which was a very difficult book to read almost you know it's rishta chilean philosophy and theology when you've read some Plato it's it's a very complex book Leo Strauss is one of the great philosophers of the twentieth century has about 500 pages of essays on the guide for the perplexed well Michael Goodman breaks it down in very user-friendly fashion books um about two hundred forty forty pages something like that really worth a read Michael Goodman's Maimonides in the book that changed the Judaism so if you're interested in sort of a good take on what Judaism constitutes this is a pretty good primer on some basic philosophy in Judaism it'sit's definitely worth the read okay other things that are like so this was hilarious so Jimmy Kimmel was criticizing Ted Cruz and Ted Cruz challenged Jimmy Kimmel to a game of basketball and Jimmy Kimmel took him up on it now I'm old enough to remember because I'm from Los Angeles when Jimmy Kimmel was the sports guy on Kevin and bean on K Rock 106.7 out here he was the sport that was literally how he started his career he started his career by giving the sports updates in the morning on K Rock now suffice it to say that I did not listen to K rock on my own I was in a carpool and I used to sit in the middle of the backseat in carpool because I was the smallest kid and I did not get to choose what was on the radio but that meant I heard a lot of Jimmy Kimmel in his younger days and doing the sports updates the sports guy played Ted Cruz and Ted Cruz beat him Ted Cruz beat Jimmy Kimmel in basketball which is just as cynical he beat him apparently 11:00 to 9:00 and Ted Cruz had a good sense of humor about the whole thing he went out took a picture with Grayson Allen because they're look-alikes Grayson Allen the Duke star and Ted Cruz and he beat him 11 and 9 it raised a bunch of money for charity and this leads me to think that we should have more charity basketball games between celebrities because it's something like 5,000 people showed up which is more than a typical WNBA game so why not Ted Cruz versus Jimmy Kimmel I'd be more interested in watching that than the WNBA I mean I'm sure the level of the skill is higher in the WNBA but still Jimmy Kimmel and it's a disgrace to the game of basketball I'm sure but it was pretty funny I mean if you look at the footage so good for Ted Cruz that's got to be just a blot on Jimmy Kimmel's record he's just got to go home and cry about that every night and he got beat by Ted Cruz in basketball hi larrya's okay time for a thing that I hate all right so Van Jones right head on Kim Kardashian Kim Kardashian of course is one of the great moral voices of our time she just as we know freed Alice Johnson from prison the 63 year old drug dealer who dealt in 3,000 kilograms of cocaine something like that so that's that's very exciting so she got one person free now she's apparently looking for other people on death row that she can go to president Trump with and try to get him to pardon says very exciting man Jones sat down with Kim Kardashian and he asked her if she wanted to run for public office oh would you ever run for office oh I don't I don't think that's even on my mind trump's president it could happen I know that's why Kanye loves him it's the idea that anything can happen so good anything happen with that I guess never say never but that's not gonna be like a Kim's run-in yeah Never Say Never for Kim Kardashian that's just what we need great okay you made a celebrity culture live in that celebrity culture it's garbage it's garbage just cuz people are famous doesn't mean that they're smart or know what they're doing on politics or know that I know I know we're all supposed to pretend that it's wonderful because Kim Kardashian's talking with Trump and now we're all supposed to pretend this is like a great thing yay so exciting oh okay I am NOT excited - Kim Kardashian is talking with trunks I don't think she knows things I think she knows things about certain things I don't think that the criminal justice system is one of those things if wants to talk with an expert referred by Kim Kardashian that's one thing but if Kim Kardashian is now going to be a politician I hate that our pilot that our politics has now suggested that study reading books knowing things these are negatives it makes you Heidi toidy to know stuff what what utter what utter nonsense and stupidity okay one more thing that I hate so there's an article at a site called the cut about by a about a woman who had her boyfriend move in with her and her husband and they had a kid so well done on screwing up your kid and here's what the piece says by Arielle Greenberg has told to Kim Brooks Rob and I were together for 12 years before we decided to open our marriage it happened not long that after not that long after we had our last child for most of our relationship I've been very focused on my career and then motherhood without much time to think about my sex life once we were done having kids my sex drive came roaring back we loved each other very much but we never been a perfect match in terms of sexual compatibility I told him I didn't think our marriage was big enough for my new sexual curiosity I wanted to explore Rob was very receptive but we wanted to take things slowly okay so note two ladies who say they want an open marriage the reason your husband is very receptive to open marriage is because men are naturally polygamous and wants to go screw as many women as possible so no wonder your husband wanted in are you sure like shocker okay and then first of all I don't believe I'm gonna say this I don't believe that a lot that the issue of sexual compatibility is a real issue I think it's an issue a personal compatibility treated extended into the realm of sex that's what I think about sexual compatibility I think that if you're a giving person in the bedroom you're likely to have a very good sex life I think that if you're an a-hole in real life you are likely to be an a-hole in the bedroom I think that's just the way that it works I think that if two people love each other and they give to each other they will have a very good sex life if not they'll have a garbage sex life this issue of oh you know we love each other and really getting all great in every other aspect of life but just in the bedroom or really bad together I think you're doing something wrong I think you're doing something wrong and I blame you okay I don't blame it on oh you have exquisite sexual taste and now I need to go out and explore the world and do the Cirque de Soleil tour of sex I just don't buy it I think it's because you're I think you're not working hard enough on your relationship now that's it sometimes there are physical actual problems sound I'm talking about I'm not talking about you have some sort of physical defect I'm not talking about you experience pain or something like that I'm talking about well you know you can have a perfectly comfortable sex but you're just not that into each other sexually and all this will work on it stop being a jerk okay here's it so this article continues and then apparently we were very open about what we were doing with everyone including our kids who are four and eight at the time because you will burn in hell okay then we sat down with them and explained that some people think when you're married to someone you can only love that one person but that we didn't believe that we thought you could love more than one person at the same time our oldest child thought about it and said for a moment then said well right I love you and I also love data and I said right and that was the end of the conversation that's not the same thing that is not the same thing I'm sorry having sex with multiple people is not the same thing as I love my wife and I love my child unless you're really perverse okay like that's that's not the way that works right there I say children are naturally very tolerant about these things we teach them our intolerance right cuz children are stupid right cuz children are dummies okay I've got two kids under five they're wonderful they're very smart for their age they're dummies okay that's because they're they're kids like you're supposed to inculcate good values okay anyway both of us started dating says this article Rob began dating a woman pretty seriously and I was seeing my quiet first met in my twenties ahaha this is what was really going on she hooked up on Facebook with an old boyfriend right we'd had a passion of a brief relationship by living on opposite coasts we had since fallen out of touch now he was living five hours away and women began a long-distance relationship where I'd see him every month or two for a couple of days after about two years of long-distance dating and getting to know our whole family Mike decided to move to our town to be close to us he was divorced and had no kids in a job he could do from anywhere when he first moved here ents in an apartment flew by a few blocks away the idea was he lived there for a year or more and we'd see how it went but it became immediately apparent that it didn't just make sense because he and I wanted to spend every night together and he was eating all those meals with us so it turns out that she wasn't like just not happy with her husband she won't have sex with him at all she wouldn't have had sex with his other dude but she wanted to have her cake and eat it too Robin Mike got along well from the start not like best friends but they genuinely enjoyed each other's company if I wasn't home they'd watch basketball and make dinner together because your husband is a doof they wouldn't turn to each other they wouldn't turn to each other if they were in crisis for that they turned to me but they got along well of all the questions people ask me about non-monogamy the one I get most is probably at the living arrangement people want to know why Mike got to live with us well none of the people Robin dated got to this seems like such a silly way to look at it the reasons you do or don't choose deliver the partner are complicated it's not that Mike got to live with us instead it made sense for him to move in he was getting a divorce he had no kids he worked from home and sure we had two kids who weren't involved with Mike but my kids don't matter because I want to get my rocks off and then they they decided to have a small bedroom on the first floor because it was more private the idea is that Rob and I would keep the master bedroom and I could go downstairs and sleep with Mike when I wanted to honestly Rob is always preferred to sleep alone I was happy to have the bed to himself because Rob as we have mentioned before is a doof okay and then they the the best part of this was the very end it turns out that they are thinking about divorce shocker shocker he says Mike and I love this living together work really well for us for four years recently Rob decided it was time for him to get his own apartment mostly because he wants a little more autonomy even though he lives right nearby and comes over for dinner most nights so we decided to divorce oh is that what happened I can't believe it no shocker it turns out that when you told your four and eight-year-olds that you can love more than one person at a time you couldn't sure I quit wow that was not predictable in any way that you would get divorced after having sex with another dude and bring him into your house couldn't what I'm just my mind blown unreal he says people might point to that and say oh so I guess non-monogamy didn't work in the end I guess it ruined your marriage or do they think poor Rob but Rob dates he has a life he fully enjoys and chose he's about to turn 50 he wanted to feel what it was like to steer his own ship for a while to have a little more space and that's what he has Mike and I are gonna get married soon I think people assume that now we'll be monogamous since our relationship is so romantic but nope we have no interest in a marriage that doesn't provide a space to express and act on attractions to other people and to continue to change and grow in a funny way been given the statistics around infidelity I think we're a lot more committed to non-monogamy than most monogamous people aren't monogamy no statistically speaking this is false you are 100% committed to non-monogamy and the majority of monogamous people are committed to monogamy and so you ruin your life and you ruin your children's life and you're on your husband's life so well done all because you weren't sexually compatible which really means that you weren't willing to be giving in the bedroom or your husband wasn't any wouldn't talk about it so well done lady these people put their kids last make me sick make me sick the kids in this they don't even come into the picture it's all about just how you feel in the bedroom well if you gonna do that don't have kids in the first place really if you want to live that lifestyle live that lifestyle don't eff up your kids ridiculous okay time for a quick Federalist paper so Federalist number 33 from the from the ridiculous to the sublime Federalist number 33 Alexander Hamilton continues to the federal taxing power so he's talking in the Constitution about the fact they get to tax at the federal level a lot of people were afraid this would lead to the federal government becoming overbearing and encroaching which happened okay so he begins by discussing the so-called Necessary and Proper Clause this is the clause of the Constitution that says that the federal government has the power to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution the powers by the Constitution vested in the government of the United States in other words if there's a power in the Constitution then the federal government can pass a law to effectuate that power and here's what Hamilton says he says what is a power but the ability or faculty of doing a thing what is the ability to do a thing but the power of employing the means necessary to its execution what is a legislative power but a power of making laws what are the mean sexy could have legislative power but laws what is the power of laying and collecting taxes but a legislative power or power of making laws to lay and collect taxes in other words when it says Necessary and Proper if I say you have the power to legislators the power to regulate interstate commerce that means it has the power to pass laws and create agencies to effectuate those laws right everybody agrees with this Hamilton says the point of this clause is to restrict the power of the federal government to only that which is necessary so otherwise you would just say the government has power to do whatever it wants instead it says the power the government has the power to regulate interstate commerce for example and then it says the government has the power to do what is necessary and proper to accomplish those those effects right now here's the problem Hamilton is totally right about this but the Supreme Court decided that the Necessary and Proper Clause was not actually the Necessary and Proper Clause that was the government should be able to do whatever it wants Clause it's a serious problem so there's a landmark decision by Chief Justice John Marshall in McCulloch versus Maryland he decided wrongly that it was the the Necessary and Proper Clause was used as the justification for the creation of a National Bank so the state of Maryland had attempted to impede the operations of the second bank of the United States by taxing out-of-state banks the second bank of the United States was the only out-of-state bank the court ruled against Maryland and Justice John Marshall said that the Constitution didn't give Congress the permission to create a federal bank but it gave Congress the implied power to do so under the Necessary and Proper Clause so Congress could realize or fulfill its expressed taxing and spending powers this is a wrongly decided case Necessary and Proper means necessary not wanted necessary was it absolutely necessary for there to be a bank of the United States to tax and spend no we haven't had a Bank of the United States for a century and a half in the United States and we've been able to tax and spend pretty well so this was not true did the worries about the Necessary and Proper Clause were well-founded but it's not clear that without the Necessary and Proper Clause the Supreme Court would have done the same thing okay so we will be back here tomorrow with all of the latest I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro
