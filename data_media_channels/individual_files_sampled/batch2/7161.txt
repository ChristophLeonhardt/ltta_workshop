a waitress is suing her former employer after she was essentially fired for refusing to wear denim pants because of her religion now this is a Pentecostal woman who told her employer hey I am not allowed to wear pants so instead of wearing denim pants can I wear a denim skirt the employer didn't respond back to her and then after her first day just fired her now the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission announced that it has sued Georgia blue LLC which has restaurants selling southern and Creole food in for Mississippi cities the federal lawsuit said that the Mississippi based company failed to reasonably accommodate the religious beliefs of K Toya Watkins who told a Georgia blue manager that her religion prohibits her from wearing pants and so I think this is I mean I think it's a pretty clear can't it's just a letter just let her wear the skirt like who cares about your stupid dress code I know but they care I don't think it's that clear I think this is a really interesting interests I think it's super clear okay she is not a doctor who says that she doesn't want to wear latex gloves because it's against her religion it's she's a waitress okay it's her wearing denim a denim skirt first of all no one's gonna notice and no one's gonna care no one's gonna go to that restaurant and say you know what everyone is wearing this uniform except for that one woman she's wearing a skirt instead of pant who cares who cares they care they care and they think that that that is they that's part of their this isn't a Hooters right you know no one's gonna come in expecting run a restaurant you you're allowed when you run a restaurant to make your staff wear uniform right right so we acknowledge that right that they can they can have you wear a uniform Amit is a little crazy that here a woman wants to wear a skirt and that were having a backwards argument here which is amuses me but yeah I mean they they jex right they they do care and it doesn't matter whether they're right about whether it really is something worth caring about they've designed a style to their restaurant in a way they want their restaurant to be and they want for some reason they want all their waitstaff walking around in G I would argue that religious liberty in this case is much more important than your dress code right like your dress code it doesn't like you got to do a cost-benefit analysis like weigh the issue and in this case I believe that her religious beliefs are more important than your stupid little dress code yeah and by the way that even though they wouldn't quite phrase it that way the the courts do actually do a balancing test oftentimes yeah and so you're technically correct that they would a name might come out on the side the Euron so but lots of twists and turns I think Pentecostal religious nuts but I think all the religions are nuts and so I know you this was beside the point if she's Pentecostal she was wearing a skirt at the interview right like they're consistent yeah she got hired and then fired a day later I don't know that they could have saved themselves a lawsuit but I mean I probably got a got sued them for failing to hire her because of her dress code but this just seems ridiculous and completely likable it does seem rude it does seem ridiculous and avoidable okay so look I I think like why do you have to wear skirt what are like religious are so nuts okay no no God wants you to wear a skirt I think it's not that you can't wear skirts oh you can't wear pants no no I know that's what I'm saying know that you have to wear skirt gods like oh you got a woman wearing pants man I am that wrong Fashion Week statement okay you're not making it into heaven insane okay anyway that's a critique of religion I know I'm starting out with that like I don't agree with her religion at all okay having said that I love that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission protects religious beliefs because I'm an American and as agnostic as as I am I believe in the First Amendment and I believe your religion should be protected so the question is where do you draw the lines because to ambria's point if you're working at Hooters and you come in as a Muslim and say I'd like to wear a burqa I can't no no that's not what we got Hooters exactly and that's that isn't business model it is a fundamental component of their business model Hooters it's in the okay pitties right so Georgia blue I think it's bull I mean I do I think it's blue jeans right Georgia okay but you can wear it a denim skirt right it's a so long as it doesn't interfere with her ability to vo she's not a FedEx driver she's not it's it's purely aesthetic which I feel like it's also problematic right yeah I mean whatever restaurants have that like every restaurant has dress code but you're right it's purely aesthetic and so if it's not interfering with her ability to do her job and do it well then I feel like it's not important right so I'll give you a comparison where I think you know religious liberty its way differently so we've talked about this before like a a Muslim cashier at a grocery store who doesn't want to handle pork well you're working at a grocery store homeboy or homegirl like it sorry like you're gonna have to handle pork you're gonna have to handle it it's part and parcel of your job yeah yeah so I agree with you I was going to use the same example so that that I think is clearly on the side of no then you can't do this job and then there's cases that I think are equally clear McDonald's allowing a yarmulke under there whatever thing that they're wearing these days or even a Muslim headdress that doesn't only interfere with the uniform that much Rastafarian it's still fine but you put it in a net if you're working in food so I think those keys are clear that's why I think there's an interesting case because it's kinda in the middle but but you if we were all judges here you guys might convince me that it's on the side of yarmulkes under your hat as opposed to if we apply the touchdown rule which is the wood jacket I like just what Jen can I decide in the NFL whether it's a catch or not because we can tell come on man he caught it he caught it yeah stop quibbling here I don't know what they may have moved no no so they should so if you let us apply that for all four of us apply that the that rule the rule would be Oh for the love of God let her wear this skirt yeah that's what the just thing is I just mean the restaurant it gets to make their cockamamie rules I would like it if there were seven other restaurants on that strip and she could just go gorgeous Bennigan's and get the same amount of money but if this is a job she wants and then I'm probably gonna come around to you know the it's crazy that you can't wear jeans on its face crazy your religion is crazy and I would include that in my Jewish or gay and then I tell them to let everywhere the skirt if you liked this video
