education secretary Betsy DeVos has been perhaps the most controversial member of trumps cabinet last week the Senate just barely confirmed her nominee to head the office of civil rights he's for Israel against affirmative action and the left is not too happy let's take a look the Senate confirms Kenneth L Marcus as assistant secretary for civil rights in Davis's Education Department by a fifty to forty six vote Marcus served in the same position under former president george w bush and currently serves as president of the brandy a center for human rights under law which fights anti-semitism on college campuses marcus has presented the case for why boycotting Israel is illegal says that such boycotts are arguably anti-semitic and may breach the academic freedom of students and professors Rahul Saxena who's a staff attorney for Palestine legal said Marcus's record clearly demonstrates that his primary mission is not to protect students civil rights it is to shield Israel from criticism it's unconscionable that the US Senate has confirmed him to oversee civil rights enforcement in Betsy divorces Department of Education even as Israel continues to gun down Palestinians protesting for their rights in Gaza yeah you know just innocent Palestinian protesters it's not as though Hamas launches rocket strikes and suicide attacks against Israelis it's not as though Palestinians get taught in school to hate and perhaps even kill Jewish Israelis it's not as though at least 50 of the 62 people killed by Israel during the may u.s. embassy ceremony belonged to Hamas or Islamic Jihad as claimed by the groups themselves but Marcus has also gotten heat for opposing affirmative action look at this a coalition representing over two hundred organizations said mister Marcus has also opposed affirmative action and Equal Opportunity initiatives the brandy Center argued that public institutions should not be allowed to use race-conscious admissions programs let's get one thing straight affirmative action does not equal equality of opportunity affirmative action is equality of outcome and that should be opposed by anyone who thinks that things like hard work communication and creativity might matter a bit more in the workplace than your genitalia or how much melanin you have the coalition also criticized Marcus for supporting divorces suspension of what the group calls important guidance clarifying the responsibilities of educational institutions in cases of sexual assault and he would not commit to continuing to publish the list of colleges and universities under investigation regarding sexual assault yeah as any sensible person would even the Washington Post blasted Obama's 2011 policy requiring that colleges find students accused of sexual assault guilty not using a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard but instead of preponderance of the evidence one so if there's a higher than 50% chance of guilt boom you're done even though if this standard were used in courts outside of college it might yield a false conviction rate of up to 33% no this hullabaloo over Marcus's confirmation is like what happens when you give a six-year-old 90% of the cake and they still want the other 10% leftists dominate academia and so the small sliver of times they don't get their way they're so unused to it that it seemed like the end of the world for campus unmasked I'm Rob shamrock if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus and mass comm you
