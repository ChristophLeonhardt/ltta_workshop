mother of another passed away at age 92 and the universal admiration for Barbara Bush was really something nice I think in an era where everybody seems to be at each other's throats over politics a couple of things are worth noting right off the bat first of all if you look at all the obituaries it says that Barbara Bush was most famous obviously for as I say being the wife of one president and the mother of another there's this weird idea that goes around in feminist circles that being a wife and being a mother is somehow degrading to women that somehow it is it is what you do not in your relationship with others but what you do in your career that matters most well for the vast majority of human beings it is what you do in your family life and the kind of children that you raise that is going to be your final legacy on the world right Barbara Bush said this herself in 1990 she was speaking at Wellesley shoes protested in 1990 so this just shows how long these college protests have been going on but Barbara Bush who was then First Lady of the United States she talked about why family was valuable in life in 1990 at a graduation so I want to offer a new legend the winner of the hoop race will be the first to realize her dream not society's dreams her own personal dream who knows somewhere out in this audience may even be someone who will one day follow in my footsteps and preside over the White House as the president's spouse and I wish him well okay so yeah she's a person who definitely understood the value of family one of the charming clips that was going around yesterday as well as a clip from 2011 George HW Bush and Barbara were on the Today Show together and and they read with their granddaughter actually and george w bush's daughter and they they read George HW read some love letters that he'd written to to Barbara and you can sort of see their relationship encapsulated in this in this short clip on December 12 1943 my darling bar this should be a very easy letter to write my grandparents have been writing each other love letters for more than 60 years I love you precious with all my heart and to know that you love me means my life 6 1994 for Barbara Pierce from gh WB will you marry me oops I forgot you did that 49 years ago today I was very happy on that day in 1945 but even happier today you give me joy that few men know I've come perhaps the highest mountain in the world but even that cannot hold a candle to being Barbara's husband mum used to tell me now George don't walk ahead you never listen to your mother little did I know I was only trying to keep up keep up a bar bar Pierce Vermont and August Street in Rye New York Speaker of the House okay so in Barbara Bush issue she was definitely a pistol there's a good piece in the New York Times by Christopher Buckley who is a a novelist and speech writer for VP HW from 81 to 83 then he talks about exactly who Barbara Bush was he said that he learned a couple of lessons from her he said there was no falsity no pretence no guile most spin no art to Barbara Bush who died on Tuesday she was what-you-see-is-what-you-get I'm on about the letter Americans are always clamoring about the virtues of transparency Barbara Bush was as transparent as distilled water whoo but she would have said of her own adored son as he weighed a campaign for the presidency if we can't find more than two or three families to run for high office that's silly there are a lot of great families there are other people out there that are very qualified we've had enough bushes thanks MA if she was mrs. no-nonsense she also had a playful even girlish side to her on one occasion I was alone in a freight elevator with mr. and mrs. Bush and their Secret Service detail when it got stuck between floors stuck elevators are viewed grimly by the Secret Service the atmosphere quickly elevated to condition dread with hands reaching for the holstered Glock nines orders Brockton to wrist mics and all the rest the bushes were blithe I was standing behind them mr. Bush's fingers reached for mrs. Bush's derriere and gave it a pinch she turned to him in grin like an 18 year old hiya fella she said so I can claim to have witnessed a primal scene between mom and dad Bush so just you know she was apparently a really a really good woman by virtually all accounts and there were tributes that came in from the Clintons there are tributes that came in from the Obamas in class all across the aisle except of course for the far left the far left found an excuse to be upset about Barbara Bush so Randy gerar who is a professor at Fresno State and obviously a delightful human being she tweeted out Barbara Bush was a generous and smart and amazing racist who along with her husband raised a war criminal F out of here with your nice words so you can always count on Twitter to provide you some of the best in American life but this does demonstrate that there is a primal hatred that exists on both sides of the aisle unfortunately with regard to some of these figures because the reality is that if people can't get beyond their own politics to to see the personal side of people like Barbara Bush it was not a political figure right I mean Barbara Bush is the kind of woman who when she was the the first lady in 1989 it was right after the election there was a lot of talk about how babies with AIDS if people were afraid that if they held the baby with AIDS or if they if a baby they'd spit up on them that they would actually get AIDS Barbara Bush and went to a Children's Center where there were babies with AIDS and she went she picked him up she carried them around in front of the cameras just to demonstrate that this was not a serious danger and yet the the fact that people hate each other so much in today's modern politics they're ripping on Barbara Bush 92 years old on the day of her death he's really classy it's not quite the same thing as ripping on Ted Kennedy the day his death I mean that guy actually left a woman to drown in a car Barbara Bush did nothing of the kind but you know dad that may be the extent to which our politics have gone awry now speaking of our politics and going awry the the story of the day yesterday continued to be the storm easy annuals fall out the Michael Cohen fall out and all of it continues to be very weird and very bizarre we're obviously living in a reality show simulation the the the former leading presidential candidate for the Democrats for a certain period of time Bernie Sanders actually tweeted out today that he wants cardi B to decide Social Security Policy C I was joking when I said I thought the cardi B's tax policy was great cuz I don't think cardi B knows all that much about tax policy Bernie Sanders apparently was not joking that just shows you how crazy things have gotten well now stormy Daniels was appearing on the view and if you don't believe that so much of our controversy so much of the hatred that we see in America's public life is now driven by the TV theatrics of our political actors all you have to do is watch TV for five minutes and be disabused of this so stormy Daniels who is a self aggrandizing porn star who had sex with a married man in 2006 earned one hundred and thirty thousand dollars out of it right before the election and then decided to forego the one hundred and thirty thousand dollars she's giving it to Planned Parenthood which is obviously a very classy move and she instead wants to make a fortune by speaking openly about her affair with Donald Trump which lasted apparently a grand total of one night and now she's on the view and on the view she's explaining that she is not in it for the money that she's not in it for the glory she is obviously in it for both the money and the glory and listen she's a free person in the United States she can do whatever she pleases but that doesn't mean that we have to put aside our critical thinking skills she showed up with her lawyer Michael a vanetti at the Michael Kohn hearing the other day in New York there was no reason for her to be there she showed up there because she wants to stay in the news and she's very good at staying in the news and the news are very good about keeping her in the news so here it was Michael a vanetti explaining that this was not a publicity stunt in stormy Daniels saying this was not a publicity stunt to show up in court to an event that had nothing to do with her I want to address the first part I'm gonna let her address the second part as it relates to us having nothing to do with the case I mean that's just not accurate on Friday judge wood who I know granted me access to that case stated that she would hear from me as to any issue that I wanted to speak about recognising that we did have standing in connection with that case because some of these documents that were seized relate to her and in fact the warrants stemmed in significant part from what happened to my client so we had every right to be there in judge would the city and federal judge would not have granted me access to address the court if we had no business being there but I'm gonna let stormy speak to this issue of making money from the tour etc guys can I just say first of all I did not name the tour that you won't hear me say it I haven't promoted that name I think it's awful and I think the name is awful yeah I don't like to use I think it's cheesy and a play on someone else's idea and I try not to do that a strip club owner and the Carolinas came up with it and everyone else has latched on to it as far as the tour I've yes I've gotten more bookings than usual but I'm doing the job that I've been doing for the last almost 20 years yes there's a lot of publicity but I didn't do it for that because this isn't what I want to be known for as a matter of fact I hid for quite a while and it's it's overwhelming and intimidating okay I'm sorry I'm sorry that like I'm sorry the the media portraying stormy Daniels has some sort of great heroine who's coming out here because she just wants the truth told this isn't what she wants to be known for yes I'm sure she wants to be known for the witches of breastwork that's what she wants to be known for anyway she really wants to be known for is stripping but not on the make America horny again tour which is what the name of her tour is that's the name that she doesn't want to mention there and she she feels really bad about that because I mean that's humiliating it's not humiliating to strip naked in front of a bunch of men after talking about having affair with the President of the United States that's not humiliating it's really the name of the tour that's really where you got a drug line I mean if you're gonna talk about class that's really where you gotta draw the line it's not you know the being a pornographic actress thing that's that's humiliating in any way it really is the fact that you're now speaking on the view fully dressed about all this stuff that's that's not what you were on and be remembered for you definitely want to be remembered for those lesbian those lesbian porn scenes that's that's definitely the thing that's gonna go on the epitaph right there like what in the world and we're supposed to believe that our politics are not broken in any significant way I'm gonna show you more of our politics being broken in just a second because this is this interview on the view really was quite

country ok so speaking of the craziness of stormy Daniels on the view everybody's favorite portion of television of course yesterday was the reality TV show reveal of the of the likeness of the person who allegedly threatened stormy Daniel so I do love that storm and Daniel says in this interview she tried to stay silent about this for a long time well no actually she tried to sell the story to In Touch magazine and then she tried to sell the story to National Enquirer and then she stole that sold the story to Trump and now she's selling the story to the media so that's not good at being quiet about things just last I checked but she says in 2011 after In Touch Weekly was going to print a story about her having a one-night affair with Trump and she was gonna get like 15 grand for all of that then some weird guy came up to her in the parking lot of some grocery store with her daughter and said to her something about how this is how a nice baby you got there would be a shame if something happened to her mother which is just something from a bad dime novel maybe it happened maybe it didn't but this reveal on the view is just so ridiculous I'm sorry if this were if this was something that really mattered to stormy Daniels I assumed she would make a police report of some sort I assumed that she would actually turn in this photograph to the police I assume that she had taken a little more seriously than to go on the view right to reveal it listen I'm not ripping on the view I desperately want to appear on the view but that said this does not exactly pass the smell test in terms of non publicity-seeking behavior from stormy Daniels you recently sat down with the forensic artists a very well-known one who created a sketch of the alleged suspect based on your memory from that day and now you're ready to reveal that sketch for the first time can we take a look at that with you and to your recollection is is that the person that threatened you absolutely looks exactly like that person Wow to your recollection is it the most generic looking photograph you have ever seen of any human being ever it looks like every male star of last 30 years in Hollywood Wow thanks thanks stormy for that you've really cleared it up I'm sure that all the information will certainly be look forthcoming although I have my own suspicions that it was Tom Brady fresh off the flight gate he had to do something to get his name out of the headlines and so he decided to go and threaten stormy Daniels in 2011 wearing the boy band haircut just really strong stuff from stormy Daniels there and the media taking all this stuff seriously is truly incredible but of course that's not the only stuff they're taking very very seriously they are also taking very seriously and continuing to do so all of the all of the information about Michael Cohen so Michael Cohen of course is president Trump's lawyer and Michael Cohen was dragged into court by washing he dragged the FBI into court because he is suing for access to all the materials that they seized from his offices there's a lot of speculation about what exactly is in those materials what exactly Michael Cohen has to worry about but the two big headlines to come out of this are that Michael Cohen is in serious legal jeopardy which could be trouble for Trump and too then one of Michael cones clients was of course the the talk show host on Fox News Sean Hannity right who with whom I'm friendly so Michael a vanetti who's the lawyer for stormy Daniels again on the view he says that he has a no fear that Michael Cohen will eventually flip on Trump and Trump will be taken down by the great and brave stormy Daniels here is actually on MSNBC a vanetti saga mean the guy just must have he must live at these TV studios as often as he's appearing on TV you think Michael Cohen's wife is going to advise him to take a twenty-year bullet for the president what about no matter what about his children I mean listen Donny Deutsch knows Michael Cohen and we know other people that know Michael Cohen he loves his kids he loves his family and he loves his kids more than he loves Donald Trump I understand the loyalty and all that other stuff that only goes so if it goes so far when your own children are saying dad what's going on it's either Trump or not what your kids grow up the level of speculation that is occurring right now on cable television is just astonishing I was watching CNN again at the gym yesterday and I don't remember whose show it was but one of the shows was just the entire hour was dedicated to speculation about the connection between michael cohen and sean hannity which is cable news the other favorite topic they're fascinated with the idea that sean hannity had the same lawyer as the president well is that really a giant shock that sean hannity is friendly with the lawyer for the president sean hannity is probably calling trump every night in fact I have pretty good information that he does talk to President Trump on a very frequent basis The Washington Post reported the same thing today that's not any sort of surprise and he's known Michael Cohen for years the only weird legal issue here is that sean has alternatively claims that Cohen was his lawyer that Cohen was not his lawyer for purposes of confidentiality and privilege that does make some difference but the nusers that are going crazy over this the the cnn's and MSNBC's that are going totally nuts over this i'm just wondering what's so crazy about hannity having the same lawyer as trump like i assume that hillary clinton's lawyers represent a lot of members of media because she probably is represented by mainstream law firms is that the end of the world right half the people in the media worked in the Clinton administration is that supposed to be some sort of great shock to anyone okay for example you seem Chuck Todd over at Emma's over at NBC and MSNBC saying that he is stunned by Fox News's coverage of the fact that Sean Hannity was using Michael Cohen as his lawyer and covering the Michael Cohn's fallout at the same time I'm just I am stunned that Fox had no punitive response not a sean hannity must disclose every night not a he can't cover this story not a he's been suspended for a week nothing not a single thing they are saying this is okay for anybody that works at Fox News okay literally George Stephanopoulos the chief of staff for Hillary Clinton who wrote in his memoirs about crime with Hillary Clinton after President Clinton - interviewed Hillary Clinton multiple times during the last campaign and ABC News made no disclosure about that at the top of any of the shows and he covered it as an objective journalist how was he magically changed into an objective journalist the answer as he wasn't it's just that the media don't care when it's a lefty who has close associations with members of the Democratic Party they cave her a deeply when a member of the media has close relationships with top members of the Republican Party right brian Stelter said some of the same stuff on on CNN he said if Rachel Maddow had been getting legal advice from Hillary's attorney Sean Hannity would go crazy let's let's imagine a parallel universe where Hillary Clinton's president Rachel Maddow was discovered to have been gained secret legal advice from a Clinton lawyer never mind the idea that that Clinton lawyer would have been raided and we'd been under investigation if Maddow was under the microscope like that Hannity would be he would be ripping he would be going wild with it he would be talking about it non-stop and I think what it's so frustrating to most Americans when these partisan Wars is the lack of consistency that Hannity would would erupt if it were the other side so I agree on the lack of consistency point my only question is why is that the brian Stelter is willing to ignore the lack of consistency on his own side of the aisle I like Brian but I'm just wondering why is it that all these people on the left side of the aisle are willing to completely overlook the fact that half of the media are staffed by people who I'm sure Cheryl lawyers with Hillary Clinton and we're probably interviewing her at the same time they don't seem to care about any of that right mean the head of CBS News was the brother of Ben Rhodes whose than it was the National Security Adviser under President Obama you know whether or not that makes a difference in news coverage is is questionable but it is something that ought to be displayed on a regular basis these close relationships that are happening the media all the time I'm just amazed that the media suddenly latch on to all of this except they're not really amazed they don't like Sean Hannity very much and obviously they don't they don't like President Trump very much now speaking of not liking president Trump James Comey continues to do his tour of his publicity tour about his book demonstrating a higher loyalty to a higher royalty attitude is very interested in making a lot of money off of his book and he is non-stop on television lately it is really amusing to watch him so yesterday he said that President Trump has a weird obsession with James Comey there's what Comey said he said Donald Trump is treating me like a scorned high school date dude you're the one who literally went and wrote a book about how much you don't like Trump my Trump wasn't saying a lot of stuff about you until you decide to come back with the book now I'm not really pleased with how Trump has handled the whole James Comey debacle I didn't think that it was greatly handled in the first place but for James Comey to be walking around saying that Donald Trump is the scorned lover in this particular relationship seems to be ignorant of things like mirrors and self-awareness it's it's pretty incredible and speaking of lack of self-awareness watch as Eric Holder tries to defend James Comey from the predations of Donald Trump he says the Donald Trump does not believe in the rule of law remember this is the Attorney General who was held in in contempt of Congress for failing to turn over record this is the guy who was responsible for the Fast & Furious scandal this is the guy who described himself as the President of the United States his wingman as opposed to you know a law enforcement officer the chief law enforcement officer of the country and he's he's complaining about Donald Trump not believing in the rule of law and the media are just sitting there taking this and then people wonder why people are not taking the media seriously this is why right here how do you make sense of those two different ways the president talks about law and order well he believes the situational law and order and there is no way that I think you can resolve the tension that you have just described he is not a believer in a base in the rule of law he wants to make sure that those people who he likes the people who support him are treated in one way and those other people whoever those other people are are treated in a different way okay so I love it that that Eric Holder is sitting here saying this with a straight face that Donald Trump you know he wants to make sure that only his allies are treated fairly but everybody else is treated unfairly you were the Attorney General under President Obama who utilized the IRS or at least his IRS went after a conservative nonprofit you were the Attorney General during fast and furious you were the Attorney General during the HHS scandal there are a dozen scandals had happened under Eric Holder and Eric Holder was simultaneously describing himself as Barack Obama's wingman and now he says that Donald Trump is inconsistent about the use of law enforcement it's really incredible speaking of inconsistent about the use of law enforcement James Comey you know again the guy with the higher loyalty he comes out and he says that he has no opinion on disciplining andrew mckay the undermine him of course is deputy director of the FBI when James Comey was there and now turns out that Andrew McCabe repeatedly lied to the FBI he repeatedly lied over and over and that's why he was fired and now James Comey says well I have no opinion on prosecuting Andrew McCabe I really have nothing to say about that so he didn't deserve the discipline he got Andrew McCabe no I think the process I don't have a view on what the ultimate discipline should have been but this is the system working this is the Justice Department holding accountable its employees to the truth so he has no opinion on what should happen to Andrew McCabe amazing can't depending on what should happen to Hillary Clinton he has opinions on what should happen to president Trump but he has no opinion on what should happen to enter mckay but the guy who worked underneath him and who was simultaneously leaking materials to the media and pretending that somebody else inside via the inside the FBI was put was performing those leaks the Inspector General has a full report on Andrew McCabe okay and what they found is that McCabe lacked candor on multiple occasions and violated FBI policy when you authorize the disclosure of sensitive investigative information to a reporter and James Comey has no opinion on any of this but don't worry the only people who are engaging in selective use of law enforcement our members of the Trump administration and look how the media prop call me up right Stephen Colbert has on James Comey last night Comey actually raised Colbert's ratings which is not a shock because Colbert's ratings have been very up and down and they drank together in come it and Colbert because there was that story in commis book about how Comey after being fired drank red wine from a from a paper cup on a plane on the way home to Washington DC so of course Colbert and call me drank together the last time Colbert drank with somebody was Hillary Clinton not a shock there either but here is Colbert really just massaging massaging Comey shoulders if it felt like you were working for a mob boss were you surprised that you got whacked because that's what they knew I actually was quite surprised because I thought I'm leading the Russia investigation even though our relationship was becoming strained there's no way I'm gonna get fired or whacked because why why wouldn't you get fired because that would be a crazy thing to do why would you fire the FBI director who's leading the Russia investigation because you're leading the Russia investigation what it says I don't know if you've dealt with mob bosses before but they don't like to be investigated okay so Stephen Colbert of course is making a point that he doesn't know that he's making which is if James Comey really thought all these terrible things about Trump why didn't he quit the first day why'd you just quit and say the president asked me for a loyalty oath I wasn't willing to give him a loyalty oath and I'm not gonna serve under to that president but of course James Comey is there in his in his I don't even know it he's wearing I mean he's wearing like a black shirt and a grey jacket that makes him look like something straight out of 50s lounge and Stephen Colbert is is talking with him of course in the most glowing terms about President Trump all of this stuff is so off-putting James Comey has nothing new to tell we know his story okay and his story is what his story is he's so self aggrandizing they I think he's actually undercutting his own cause James call me again former FBI director yesterday he said that he imitated LeBron James on leadership no this isn't this isn't a real this is just astonishing this isn't him pandering in any way this is what he says I'm sure that he just goes around talking about LeBron James on leadership this is what James Comey does admire LeBron James and he's probably about to find out I used to talk about him all over the FBI and say he illustrates what the endless pursuit of excellence looks like but every offseason I've read he tries to find a part of his game to make better which is crazy because he's already better than everybody else it's because he measures himself not against the others but against himself so I used to say inside the FBI look this is a great organization but it's not good enough it can't ever be good enough we have to find parts of our game to make better look at LeBron James he is in sufferable I'm sorry he's just insufferable there's no English James Comey and not think that he's actually doing damage to the anti-trump cause by being this insufferably douche I mean it's just awful that's not a word but I've coined it for James Comey my goodness gracious you know the president Trump doesn't help himself by the way when he fires back on this he should just let James Komi hang out there in the breeze I mean he really should just let james comey i'll six foot nine of him say silly things and be looked at is silly but president Trump can't help himself so he tweets out slippery James call me the worst FBI director in history was not fired because of the phony Russia investigation where by the way there was no collusion except by the Thames you know mr. president you literally said on national television to Lester Holt that you fired him because of the Russia investigation like you literally said that that's the only reason there's a special counsel right now hey the revisionist history from President Trump is not helpful here so James Comey may be a terrible FBI director I think that he was James Comey maybe a self aggrandizing douche I think that he is but president Trump made a big mistake when he fired James Comey and then went on national television to brag about it saying that the real reason he fired James Comey is cuz Comey wouldn't come out and say that he was innocent in the Russia investigation that forced Rod Rosenstein the guy who wrote the letter and that provided the impetus for firing James Comey that force Rosenstein to recuse himself an appoint Robert Muller there would be no Robert Muller today if it were not for President Trump firing James Comey and then talking about it on national television to him denying it now is just silly you know again the president should be above these things he should just let it all play out everyone can see this stuff okay I have enough faith in the American people that they can look at the Stormy's annual stuff and they can look at her reviewing ridiculous mock-ups of generic-looking white men who threatened her in a parking lot and say all of this seems like reality TV show nonsense the president apparently doesn't have that faith or he can't control himself so he tweeted out about stormy Daniels he said that this was a con job as well he said quote a sketch years later about a non-existent man a total con job playing the fake news media for fools but they know it exclamation point again you know for fake news media for fools all of that is capitalized which is weird but you know why is the president doing this I don't think it serves his purpose I think that not only does it not serve his purpose it's counterproductive and in a very serious way because what he really should be he shouldn't be saying anything but if his people are saying anything it should be well if that actually happened then the president had no knowledge of any of that when he just says that this is a non-existent man when he comes out and says this this never happened now he's in a food fight with a former porn star he had sex with and none of this is good for the president none of this is good for the President's agenda now speaking of not great for the President's agenda yesterday there were a couple of dings in in the White House those things came courtesy of Justice Gorsuch so there's been a lot of talk of course about justice Gorsuch and justice course which being president Trump's main main victory as presidents of the United States there's a lot of truth to that I think justice Gorsuch has been terrific thus far well he ruled on a case yesterday and a lot of folks were very angry at him they were angry at him because he sided with the courts liberals on a case with regard to the mandatory deportation of Alita of illegal immigrants so the case was called sessions versus de Maya and involved a legal immigrant who came to the United States years ago as an adult this guy was twice convicted of burglary federal law permits deportation of legal immigrants if they are convicted of an aggravated felony one type of which is a crime of violence the Obama and Trump administrations both claimed is according to allah pundit over at hot air that burglary can be categorized as a crime of violence because of the way the statute is worded any crime which by its nature involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense is a crime of violence whether or not physical force was actually used in deciding whether a crime by its nature as a crime of violence courts are supposed to look at what the ordinary case involving that crime might look like so the courts for liberals thought that this was unconstitutionally vague this did not make clear when you could support somebody and when you could not deport somebody and Gorsuch concurred he said that the Congress has to do a better job of writing its legislation right here's what he wrote he wrote vague laws invite arbitrary power before the Revolution the crime of treason and English law was so capacious ly construed that the mere expression of disfavored opinions could invite transportation or death the founders cited the Crown's abuse have pretended crimes like this as one of their reasons for revolution today's vague laws may not be as invidious but they can't invite the exercise of arbitrary power all the same by leaving the people in the dark about what the law demands and allowing prosecutors and courts to make it up so this does not sound like a wildly liberal decision from Justice Gorsuch in fact it sounds very much like what Justice Scalia might have said in the same case there's an argument over whether this statute was vague or whether the statute was not vague and nowhere does it say the Congress can't simply redraw the statute to make it less vague and then apply it going forward again there was a case called United States versus Johnson a couple of years ago about the armed career criminal act and it said if you were convicted of three prior violent felonies under the law then you could be a given extra prison time and there was some wiggle room in what it meant to be a violent felon and Antonin Scalia actually wrote with the four liberals as well as John Roberts they wrote the majority opinion so it's not you know out of the realm of possibility for Justice Gorsuch to and people are saying well this means he's Anthony Kennedy that's not true I just don't I just don't think that's right at all I think justice course which continues to be a real asset to the court and I think the ruling yesterday it's controversial but I don't think that ed Gorsuch gets this one wildly wrong now speaking of controversies that may mean more inside the administration apparently nikki Haley is now in a fight with other members of the administration so nikki Haley who is of course at the United Nations as I have said my spirit animal nikki Haley at the United Nations is my favorite thing in American government in a very long time she's the US ambassador to the UN well I'm on Sunday she said that there would be new sanctions against Russia that were forthcoming and then the administration walked that back and Larry Kudlow suggested that she had been confused and so nikki Haley let Dana Perino know in a statement over Fox News quote with all due respect I don't get confused knows after Kudlow had told the reporters that there might have been some confusion momentary confusion he said she was certainly not confused come back down I was wrong to say that totally wrong so apparently what happened is that she made these comments and then the circumstances sort of changed and she was not informed of that and so there's a miscommunication in the White House that is not a particular shot but Haley getting very aggressive about the fact that she was not confused about anything I think that's because you know look Nikki and there's some pretty strong principles and I think that she's right to hold those principles now one thing you got to be aware of is there are members of the White House you don't like nikki Haley and there are members of the White House who are not fond of Mike Mike Pence the Vice President so there's a story from the New York Times today all about how nikki Haley and Mike Pence are secretly planning a coup inside the White House the Mike Pence wants to run for president and nikki Haley would run for VP in 2020 if something should happen to President Trump but they're sort of stationing themselves that way this of course would lead to president Trump being suspicious and angry just this week President Trump knocked down a person who's supposed to be appointed a national security adviser for pence who was coming from Nikki Haley's team the reason for that is that this particular person apparently was not a trump supporter and Trump has a nose for such things he doesn't want anybody who didn't support him in the last election cycle being in any position remotely approaching power well with all of that said you know the the the idea that Mike Pence and nikki Haley are planning some sort of coup inside the I don't see the evidence for that I think that a lot there's a lot of bad blood inside the white house unfortunately and that bad blood inside the white house has not died down over the period of time that the president has been president in fact in some ways it's gotten worse but the media also have an interest in fostering this sort of chaos they're very much interested in continuing to push the notion that the white house is a place of backstabbing and backbiting in which the vice president is going to go up against the President and all that sort of nonsense I just don't I don't buy it I know all these people who are who are now talking about and I don't think that this is a real thing okay in just a second I want to talk about

largest fastest core and conservative podcast in the nation all righty so meanwhile over in California the California Legislature is pushing a new law that really should scare people it essentially bans the sale of particular books I am not kidding this is something that is happening in the state of California so according to David French over at National Review Assembly Bill 2943 would make an unlawful business practice to engage in a transaction intended to result or that results in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer that advertised offer to engage in or do engage in sexual orientation change efforts with an individual the bill then defined sexual orientations change efforts as any practice that seeks to change an individual's sexual orientation this includes efforts to change behaviors or gender expressions or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attractions or feelings toward individuals of the same sex hey this is insane I'm sorry this is this is insane this bill is totally crazy it doesn't matter whether you believe that conversion therapy works I think the evidence on that is at best mixed and leaning very strongly toward no but that does not mean that you shouldn't be able to read a book about how to fight particular urges or that urge you to behave in certain ways rather the entire religious worldview is that you have lots of urges right we all have lots of urges and a lot of those urges are bad for you and you should resist those urges as much as possible but under California law such books could be banned in the state of California like really and even worse it says it includes efforts to change behaviors or gender expressions so in other words if I have a 3 year old kid and that 3 year old kid is expressing that they want to be the opposite sex I can't take that kid to a therapist who's going to say that who's going to try to make sure that my kids feelings of gender disorientation are alleviated I don't have the ability to do that in the state of California how in the world is that constitutional the answer is it's not constitutional the answer is also that folks on the left in California don't care so we talk about tyranny coming in the guise of a happy face well this is what we're talking about the folks on the left in California suggesting of course that gender expression is innately baked into the cake that you know that sexual orientation is innately baked into the cake and that any attempt by anyone to say any difference should be illegal in the state of California is fully crazy and fully violative of First Amendment basic freedoms it's also not true ok it's also not true human behavior changes on a regular basis now I'm not talking about your desires your desires may not be changeable but it is a fact that when it comes to for example gender expression 80 percent of all kids who identify as cross gender when they are young grow out of it by the time they are teenagers and you're now telling me that I have to reinforce that at the state level and that if I don't the state is going to sue me the state is going to punish me but remember this isn't just seeking the services of a second of a psychiatrist this is if I even buy a book about this if Barnes & Noble carries a book about how to deal with a child who's suffering from gender dysphoria and that book suggests that you don't have hormone treatment or humor at that this may actually be a violation of California state law I mean this is insane this is it's totally crazy as David French writes to take one example large numbers of children who exhibit gender dysphoria eventually desist their dysphoria resolves itself as they grow older indeed they're serious research indicating this is the most likely outcome for a child with gender dysphoria but under a B 2943 the very act of communicating this truthful and indeed hopeful message could very well lead to legal jeopardy not just that you can see a world in which California goes even further than this and starts taking children out of homes if you're a parent who says listen my little girl is not a little boy no matter what she says then you could see the state saying you are now in engaging in child endangerment I cannot imagine the Supreme Court of the United States would uphold this law I just can't imagine it now maybe you know maybe a couple of the justices will try to uphold the law some of the more radical justices but I just can't imagine that the Supreme Court would say this doesn't violate the First Amendment it very very obviously violates the First Amendment has already passed through two committees by eight to two and eight to one margins it may come up for an assembly vote this week and of course this is the future of gay Californians the future of the left so if you want to write folks on the right are so unwilling to make bargains with folks on the left about social issues this is the reason because social leftists are interested in not only changing minds but enforcing that change on people from above using the power of government I mean this is truly evil stuff suggesting to people they shouldn't be able to buy books they want to by suggesting to people that they shouldn't be able to bring kids to the therapist they want to bring kids to is just insane and evil it really is and the fact that California is pursuing it demonstrates how crazy the left has gone on social issues particularly okay time for some things that I like and then some things that I hate so things that I like today so I'm in the middle of reading a book by Todd s Purdum called something wonderful and it really is a great book it's all about Rogers and Rogers and Hammerstein of course I'm a huge Rodgers and Hammerstein fan carousel Oklahoma South Pacific The Sound of Music the King and I they wrote a bevy of fantastic fantastic musicals the one I've lately been listening to a lot is carousel and you know I have to say my kids have totally ruined me I used to be able to listen to carousel without crying or without being emotional in any way and that was the way I preferred my life and now I listen to carousel and and I'm a mess so well done children you've destroyed me as a human being but the the relationship between Rogers and Hammerstein not only does it say something about you know how great art is created but the art that they created is quintessentially American if you look at the work that they did so much of it is about this sort of liberal consensus post-world War two and even during World War two about what it was that America stood for what America was fighting for they have several shows about cross cultural exchanges they have a couple of shows specifically about fighting racism South Pacific particularly is a very anti-racist show they take on some really difficult issues in carousel for example Billy Bigelow who's the hero of the show he's really not the hero of the show he's the antihero of the show he's a really bad guy I'm one of the descriptions about Billy Bigelow his character that I think resonates is that Billy Bigelow and carousel is supposed to be a really bad person who you significantly dislike until he starts to sing because when he's saying suddenly he's expressing what he feels as opposed to how he behaves and you sort of understand all the challenges that he faces as a character but they're spousal abuse in carousel and it's taken very seriously in the show it's it's just there has been no better lyricist than then Oscar Hammerstein despite all the talk about how naive his lyrics are you cannot listen to the soliloquy from carousel without understanding how good his understanding of human character was and also the understanding of what male and female are like and I think that if you look back to - his lyrics particularly about how women sing about men how men sing about women and it's very true to what men and women are on a general level of course general level doesn't apply to each individual but it does apply in general and in the soliloquy particularly like there's one beautiful move that oscar hammerstein makes in the soliloquy from carousel you should go listen to it if you haven't there's Billy Bigelow is realizing that his wife has told him she's pregnant and he is a complete narrative well he's a loser he's a bum but he thinks of himself very highly he thinks that he's the strongest guy in the world and so he starts off thinking wow I could have a boy and so he starts off talking about his boy bill and what his boy bills gonna be like he's gonna be as tall and as strong as a tree you know he's gonna he's probably gonna go around telling all the other kids follow all the other kids that I can lick their fathers well I can write you know I'm a tough rough guy and my kid's gonna be tough and rough just like me and then he realizes halfway through the soliloquy that this could be a girl and then his expression totally changes right everything changes suddenly he realizes he has to be responsible human being suddenly he realizes that he has to go out and make some money he says that you can you can have fun with the son but you have to be a father to a girl and by the end of the show by the end of the song he starts off talking about how strong he is and how tough he is and how he wants to see that in his son and by the end of the song he says you know I I can't I need to go out I need to earn I need to go make some money because I don't want my daughter growing up in an area with a bunch of bums just like me suddenly there's actually some introspection that takes place when you have kids that you're responsible for it's an amazing amazing song but that's true of all of their lyrics the simplicity of Hammerstein s lyrics are deceptive because people think that great lyrics are really complex they think that lin-manuel Miranda's lyrics are are of the same level as Hammerstein s or even Sondheim sort of the same level as Hammerstein I really don't think that's the case I think that Hammerstein had a unique understanding of human individuality and that's why you can listen to lyrics from two different characters in Hammerstein show and they sound very different whereas you listen to Sondheim lyrics for most of his characters they sound like Sondheim almost in the way the Aaron Sorkin is a very good writer but all his characters sound like versions of Aaron Sorkin the same is not true for Hammerstein okay so check out the book something wonderful by Todd Purdum other things that I like so it was pretty amazing a heroic female pilot did save the Southwest flight this is a frightening story so obviously if you saw yesterday it was all over the news there was a Southwest flight from New York to Dallas and the Southwest flight an engine came off the plane and like exploded part of the left engine ripped off and part of it flew through the window it killed a woman there was a woman who sucked a flow out of the plane she ended up dying she apparently was a tremendous person as well from from all accounts but the woman who saved the flight with the pilot was Tammy Joe Schultz 56 she was one of the first Air Force pilots in the United States to be a woman and she's a religious Christian and apparently a passenger on the flight said we were leaving LaGuardia heading to Dallas we were west of Philadelphia probably about 30,000 feet all of a sudden we heard this loud bang rattling and then it felt like one of the engines went out the oxygen masks dropped and flight attendants did a good job the pilot came on said we're diverting to Philadelphia and you know there was a serious medical injury I don't know much about that but I was sitting in front with a couple of passengers we got the masks on and as soon as we landed we were thankful the pilots did a great job the crew did a great job they got us down to Philly and that's when I took a photo of the engine and it appeared that it shredded the left side engine completely so we were coming down we dropped 30,000 feet to 25 thousand feet the pilot regained control it was pretty scary the pilots did a great job so who exactly is this woman Leslie say she was one of the first female fighter pilots and the first woman to fly in f-18 she wasn't permitted to fly in combat but she became an aggressive an aggressor pilot and an instructor and of course she is also a religious Christian she talks about the fact that every time she flies she sees it as proof of Christ in her life so sounds like a pretty amazing person and well worth celebrating ok time for a quick thing that I hate all righty time to give you the update on the Starbucks the Starbucks boycott the stupid Starbucks boycott so as I say yesterday I said yesterday on the show that I am skeptical of the stories that some vast swath of racism is happening across the country by Starbucks employees and I showed you a tape from one Starbucks and torrents which is an area that is about 40% and the 35% Asian and I think it's about 2% black and and largely Hispanic as well so it's it's a heavily minority area and this this Starbucks employee supposed the Asian supposedly told the black guy he couldn't use the restroom and always saw of the tape is what the black guy had to say about it but we never heard the managers account of exactly what happened but the same thing happened at the Starbucks in Philadelphia that led this whole thing off but it turns out that the manager of the Starbucks has spoken out her name is Holly and she has spoken relatively anonymously what she says happens is that these two black guys come in and they sit down and then they not only refuse to leave but when asked politely to leave because they're not buying anything begin to get a little bit aggressive with her they begin to and she calls the police like they just won't leave she says then they come in they say can we use the restroom she says no and then they just sit down and they say there now do I believe her do I believe the two black guys who were talking about this well you know all I can say is that the supporting evidence tends to tends toward the story of the of the manager and the reason I say that is because the police chief was a black guy said that when the police came and they asked these two guys to leave that you guys said no the two guys refused they said go ahead and arrest us you know they were apparently relatively aggressive with the officers as well not only that but it turns out that this woman Holly who was the who's the new store manager I got a letter from one of these listeners to the ben shapiro show who routinely goes to this particular starbucks and knows the manager and here is what she wrote me when she wrote me is i don't know what happened last week with its two guys i wasn't there but i highly doubt that she saw the two men and decided to call the police based solely on the fact that they are black well according to this this person who listen to the show quote from my observations and interactions with her i was actually under the impression that holly is an sjw feminist of the highest order once i even heard her scorn a male barista for not using the proper neutral pronouns of somebody that's why this whole situation is so shocking to me even though i did not agree with her and all the SJW pins that adorn her beanie i think calling her a racist all over the news in daxing her name address phone family etc is disgusting the patron said Holly's not racist and doesn't deserve what is happening to her here in Philly the patrons of the Starbucks are quote bloke black and white and I've personally seen Holly give the oh so coveted restroom code to both black and white people patrons and non patrons I've seen her trained both black and white staff members she's been nothing but nice to everyone I've never witnessed any racist behavior I mean I agree with the way she carries herself with the colorful hair and the hippie pins but I can recognize when someone is doing their job well again it would be very weird if Holly were a giant racist working in Philadelphia at a Starbucks the city is 42 percent black it did that they'll just be a very weird hiring decision and she lasted a year at the job without anybody else having any complaints so I find this whole story somewhat suspicious but Starbucks is a soft target Starbucks is never going to say that the incident didn't happen or defend their employee they're always going to cave in to the SJW Krab because this is what they do this is the danger of being on the side of the sjw's eventually they always eat their own okay so we'll be tomorrow with
