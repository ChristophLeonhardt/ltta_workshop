Jim follow up on Sara's question from NPR she asked you about Ivanka Trump's statement that the press is not the enemy of the people and she asked you whether or not the press is the enemy of the people you read off a laundry list of your concerns about the press and things that you feel like are misreported but you did not say that the press is not the enemy of the people and I I think it would be a good thing if you were to say right here at this briefing that the press the people who are gathered in this room right now doing their jobs every day asking questions of officials like the ones you brought forward earlier or not the enemy of the people I I think we deserve that the president has made his position known I also think it's ironic I'm trying to answer your question I politely waited and I even called on you despite the fact that you interrupted me why calling on your colleague I said it's ironic and which is why I interrupted I'm trying if you if you finish if you would not mind letting me have a follow-up that would be fun but it's ironic Jim that not only you and the media attacked the president for his rhetoric when they frequently lower the level of conversation in this country repeatedly repeatedly the media resorts to personal attacks without any content other than to incite anger the media has attacked me personally on a number of occasions including your own Network said I should be harassed as a life sentence that I should be choked ice officials are not welcomed in their place of worship and personal information is shared on the Internet when I was hosted by the Correspondents Association of which almost all of you are members of you brought a comedian up to attack my appearance and call me a traitor to my own gender in fact as I know and as far as I know I'm the first press secretary in the history of the United States that's required Secret Service protection the media continues to ratchet up the verbal assault against the president and everyone in this administration and certainly we have a role to play but the media has a role to play for the discourse in this country as well if I may follow up excuse me you did not say in the course of those remarks that you just made that the press is not the enemy of the people are we to take it from what you just said we all get put through the wringer we all get put in the meat grinder in this town and you're no exception and I'm sorry that that happened to you I wish that that have not happened but for the sake of this this room the people who are in this room this democracy this country all the people around the world are watching what you're saying Sarah and the White House for the United States of America the presidency should not refer to us as the enemy of the people his own daughter acknowledges that and all I'm asking you to do Sarah is to acknowledge that right now and right here I appreciate your passion I share it I've addressed this question I've addressed my personal feelings I'm here to speak on behalf of the president he's made his comments clear you
