Democrat leaders are warning President Trump not to fire special counsel Robert Muller they say the move could spark a constitutional crisis and Muller should instead be allowed to overturn the results of a national election because of some meaningless payments to a pornstar thereby starting a second civil war over nothing Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is suggesting Congress pass a law to protect mr. Muller so that the Constitution would be protected by a completely unaccountable agent of Democrat Vendetta who would remain in office forever no matter what he did the White House rejected the Democrats suggestions and says president Trump will instead shoot himself in the foot while pounding his head against the wall until Mao Muller magically falls down and dies in short our government is in the very best of hands and if you'll all just wait here I'm going to Canada to get help trigger warning after Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show all right it is mailbag day you know what that means your miserable existence is about to take a turn possibly the worst maybe for the better you never know you never know I mean look at where you are right now anything is worth trying right we will answer all your questions we answered a lot of questions yesterday the conversation that was good I thought that was a really good episode I mean really excellent questions incredibly brilliant answers obviously like the mailbag guaranteed 100% correct and always like talking to Alicia you know she usually won't sit that close to me because of the restraining order but she has to for the conversations that was very pleasant the but you know I just want to point out that all these things depend on your subscriptions if you subscribe you can ask questions solve all your problems if not if you if you don't work part with that lousy ten bucks if you're gripping that lousy ten bucks or a hundred bucks for the whole year you're not only not up getting your leftist tears tumblr but you are also wallowing in these terrible problems that I would solve for you like that for just a lousy ten bucks all right speaking of solving all your problems the biggest problem you have to solve if you're a guy every day is you got to shave I have to shave practically my entire body since all my body weight is in my head so I love Dollar Shave Club I have subscribed to them for years before they became sponsors what you do is you just sign up and they will send you you pick the kind of razor you want they'll send you razor anything else you want that will you know that you use in the bathroom they can supply it's just great they have oh they have three different razors one just has two blades like a normal razor then there's one with four and then the one I use which is the executive which has 672 blades and takes an actual week to move over your head you just start it and then it just continues to shave you for a week so it's really useful Dollar Shave comm will deliver everything you need to look feel and smell your best it's more than just razors it's better than shopping in a store cuz I know when you go to the store you open that thing and the alarm goes off do you have this in your pharmacy when when I go to the far sea and open the razor blade thing it just the alarm goes off but this is everything you can get dr.

don't there's so much news I mean so much news we've got Paul Ryan we've got this investigation into Michael Kohn got Syria and then we got Zuckerberg which is one of the things I want to talk about today Mark Zuckerberg up on the hill testifying before Congress and all of it I just want to put all of it into context for a moment okay I've talked about this before but I just want to put it all in one place this you know we keep hearing this idea of nationalism versus globalism and what I keep saying is globalism is a false flag term it's a false term because it's a global world it is a global world I mean people can travel the world you know very quickly they can communicate across the entire globe in a split second where it's going to be a global world I share ideas we're all on each other's radar we see each other we see what's going on I can you know use the phone the size of a matchbox to talk to somebody in Mozambique right now it's a it's a global world that is not the question the question is whether we are independent actors in a global world and which ideas are going to matter and which ideas are going to colonize the world and also who makes the decisions that is the big one you know since progressivism got started I mean you can go back to Teddy Roosevelt or you know Woodrow Wilson but since progressivism got started the idea has been that the notions of the founders were out of date so you know you go back to Wilson you're talking about really the beginning of the 20th century early days in the 20th century and you had Wilson saying oh you know what if he called our inalienable rights a lot of nonsense he said this is mere he said the inalienable rights of man are mere sentiment and pleasing speculation put forward as fundamental principle first college president to become president which should tell you something about college presidents and he he said government should do whatever experience permits or The Times demand and the president is at liberty both in law and conscience to be as big a man as he can you know I mean it's a whole idea that people as wise as Woodrow Wilson they're people by the way on the Left they still idolized Wilson he was a terrible president he was an racist he was a tyrant and me and these are the things that he believed he hated the Constitution and the idea was the guy's a college president are you the people going to tell a college president what to do in these complex times and that was FDR's point too you know he would constantly say well in the Constitution it was written about back in horse and buggy days that was his phrase back in a horse and buggy days and he would say you know that couple of people got together and for their time they were doing the right thing and how wonderful but now we're in this complicated age and we need the experts Barack Obama right in that you know wheelhouse basically saying no if I could lock my he see once he said something like if I could solve all these problems without passing laws I'd do it you know you know the the assumption being that he knew how to solve the problems he and his experts knew how to solve the problems it was just the Constitution slowing him down you know that's that was that's the basic idea and so when they talk about globalism they're not really talking about globalism they're talking by about rule by the expert elite and why would anybody want to get in the way of the expert elite in the idea is look at look how wonderful we've done you know look look at all the machines you have look how healthy you are look how our poverty has gone down but of course the the idea that this was done by experts reading is not right it's not accurate I mean after all Barack Obama had all the experts in the world to help him and you know what happened I mean he set the Middle East on fire right he got out of Iraq like the experts said and Syria and Iraq went you know I Isis went through there like a firestorm you know he made these deals well you know Barack Obama was the same I don't know it was 2014 Syria has no chemical weapons anymore see we've done look look how well we've done Syria has no chemical weapons anymore well now we see the Syria does have chemical so the experts not so much you know the experts are wonderful true experts are wonderful but they need to convince us we are their judges we're the jury we're the voters they need to come to us and say this is why you do what you do and stop lying all the time and stop peddling hysteria like some of the climate change people do you know I believe that climate change is a problem things we have to address but the hysteria is just to gain power for these elites so in these last couple of days we've seen really this move on the part of Muller and I said this yesterday it may be it may be that he has something on Michael Kohn or it's not really Muller now it's been passed off to the Southern District in New York but it's still the feds going after Michael cone the president's personal attorney and the word today is that they're going after payments to women that Trump slept with and my question to these people is not like whether you know obviously nobody's above the law but my question to these people is are you really going to tell us that you're going to overturn an election because women Trump sleeps around I mean that's what you're telling us is that really what you're going to say are you really going to say to Kim jong-un the guy coming to speak with you and negotiate with you over nuclear izing your continent is you know is in trouble because he slept with someone is that really what you're going to tell us I mean is it really true that you're going to throw the go out you're gonna impeach you you know when we win the right try to do that to Clinton the voters rightly rejected it I said I said so at the time I felt the same way at the time I thought this is not the voters elected Clinton this is not how you tell him it's over unless he is committing high crimes and misdemeanors about governance you know this is not what you do and so you know I'm really sorry to see Paul Ryan Paul Ryan announced today that he's not gonna run obviously Speaker the house and I know a lot of conservatives hate Paul Ryan and I would add to this I don't think Paul Ryan was a very good speaker of the house although he put forward his accomplishments today here's Ryan talking probably the tickets achievements for me our first the major reform of our tax code for the first time in 36 years which has already been a huge success for this country that's something I've been working on in my entire adult life second something I got much much more invested on since becoming speaker is to rebuild our nation's military and after tax reform addressing our military readiness crisis that was a top priority that we got done last month as well these I see is lasting victories that will make this country more prosperous and more secure for decades to come there are so many other things that we have gotten done and of course I'm gonna look back proudly on my days at the Budget Committee the Ways and Means Committee so here's the thing about Paul Ryan was he a great speaker the house no he wasn't he was not a cat Wrangler he was not that guy who's not the institutional man that he needed to be and he talks about the things that he accomplished that he's happy about but I know I know his chief concern was the overspending and the debt you know of the government and that he what he really wanted was to reform our entitlement program entitlements are like regulations like over-regulation entitlements are the largest problem that nobody cares about they're the biggest problem we have that people don't care about why don't think air about it they don't want to lose their entitlements I don't want you to take the government to take their entitlements away I did you know there's the old joke you know tell the government to keep their hands off my Medicare you know which they want they think the government should not be involved in their lives unless they're getting money and then they want the money Paul Ryan put forward and an absolutely sane and sensible way to do this good entitlement reform by the way it's called the third rail of American politics because if you step on it you die right Paul Ryan had the guts to step on it and he tried his best he put forward an absolutely rational plan when they instituted Social Security to kick in at 65 people generally lived to so it wasn't gonna bankrupt the government now people live til 80 routinely there's nothing wrong with saying to the young generation hey you're gonna have to wait an extra two three four years before this kicks and it would have saved us it would have saved the program for years to come there's not like there's money that money you pay into Social Security is not in a box somewhere and they're doling it out as you get old you were simply being supported by the work of younger people and so to keep that at a minimum and to keep from going broke we should have done what Paul Ryan said he was wrong footed by Donald Trump who said he wasn't going to do it I'm really sorry to see it I'm sorry to see him go because it seems to me that a lot of Republicans are deserting and it does look right this minute that this could totally change it does look like a blue tide is coming in the midterm elections and that is going to be a really sad fact because Donald Trump is not so principled that he won't govern to the left if that's the Congress that he has so the thing is in trying to cut entitlements and trying to cut debt Ryan was trying to cut back the state and you always have to remember you're always in the minority when you're trying to do that because all the other actors in this art part of the state conservatives are in the minority Republicans and Democrats are in the majority now Democrats at their furthest level want the state to be everything they want they want their socialist they want the state to take over the means of productions they want the state to run every aspect of your life but the spectrum stops somewhere around people who want the state to grow well more slowly they want to take over your life more slowly and then the Conservatives are kind of the outliers so it's in this context that I want to look at Zuckerberg testimony yesterday he's still testifying today but first we should talk about the freedom project Academy because though you know you always hear old folks like me saying hi when I went to school I walked five miles in the snow we're lying but it is true that that case changed you know when I was a kid we learned civics we learned why America was the way it was we learned how it worked and America's schools are nothing like that anymore we grew up in safety we were learning we weren't learning about safe spaces and you know protecting ourselves from ideas we didn't like and even though technology continues to offer new opportunities for learning we can all agree the traditional moral values which were once woven into the fabric of the classroom have practically disappeared so you should consider Freedom Project academies fully accredited judeo-christian classical online school for kindergarten through high school this is an incredible interactive education where students attend live classes every day with teachers and fellow classmates from across the country but it's online so you don't have to walk five miles in the snow although you can if you want to if you know if that's something that you feel will bring you back it into the traditional path FPA doesn't accept a penny of government funding which allows them to stay committed to teaching students how to think not what to think families can enroll students full-time or start with a single class it's entirely up to you here's what you do go to freedom for school dot-com freedom for school comm and request your free information packet from freedom project Academy enrollment ends in July but classes fill up fast so go to freedom for school.com freedom for school calm and please remember to tell them that I sent you if you know who I am if you don't know who I am look in the mirror make sure you know who you are and then go and tell them that I sent you so that they will continue to sponsor us so Zuckerberg goes up to Congress right and and this is a kabuki show you know this is a pure show when Barack Obama was lifting information for his campaign off Facebook all we heard about us wow this young you know we new president who knows so much he can use Facebook when they there's some proof that Facebook helped Donald Trump get elected it's like all sucker call that young man into the principal's office right now we needs a good talking-to and the thing about Zuckerberg is Zuckerberg is a BS artist I mean Zuckerberg has been giving the same speech for ever right so he goes that before and he apologizes for the fact that his security has been breached and information has been stolen playing cut number eight but it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well and that goes for fake news foreign interference and elections and hate speech as well as developers and data privacy we didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility and that was a big mistake and it was my mistake so here's from the Wired magazine right in 2000 year in 2003 one year before Facebook was founded a website called Facemash began non-consensual e scraping pictures of students at Harvard from the school's intranet and asking users to rate their hotness obviously it caused an outcry the websites developer quickly proffered an apology this was Mark Zuckerberg I hope you understand this is not how I meant for things to go and I apologize for any harm done as a result of my neglect to consider how quickly the site would spread and its consequences thereafter I definitely see how my intentions could be seen in the wrong light 2006 three years later the young company Facebook blindsided its users with the launch of news feed which collated and presented in one place information that people had previously had to search for piecemeal many users were shocked and alarmed that there was no warning and that there were no privacy controls what is Zuckerberg say this was a big mistake on our part and I'm sorry for it we really messed this one up we did a bad job of explaining what the new features were and an even worse job of giving you control of them 2007 a year later Facebook's beacon advertising system launched without proper controls or consent ended up compromising user privacy by making people's purchases public what did Zuckerberg say we simply did a bad job with this release and I apologized for it I'm not proud of the way we've handled this situation and I know we can do better by 2008 Zuckerberg had written only four posts on Facebook's blog every single one of them was an apology or an attempt to explain a decision that upset users 2010 after Facebook violated users privacy on and on it goes this is what he does and it's not going to change it's there the whole point of this the whole point of this is it's not going to change in terms of them making money giving your information to advertisers of Sheryl Sandberg the CEO of Facebook was on with Savannah Guthrie and Savannah asked her you know Kent is there an opt-out button listen to the response so here's how our business works we don't sell data ever we do not give personal data to advertisers people come on to Facebook they want to do targeted ads and that's really important for small business but people want to show ads we take those ads we show them and then we don't pass any individual information back to the advertiser you don't have to pass it because you collect all the information and then you target the ads for the advertisers that's the sense rate that you charge the advertisers that's right and that's a very good service that's a privacy protective good service could you come up with a tool that said I do not want Facebook to use my personal profile data to target me for advertising did you have an opt-out button please don't use my profile data for advertising we have different forms of opt-out we don't have an opt-out at the highest level that would be a paid product that's their business their business is commercials and they give your if they use your information to send you the commercials they think you want to see and there's no they're holding you for wrexham essentially there's nothing I love this is a paid product there's no you can't opt out of that because that's that's the business that is how the business it's like when you fast-forward through commercials on television you are stripping them of their business model that is how they make their money so they're not going to change and they are tracing you I mean senator wicker asked Zuckerberg if they were following you after you left Facebook and here's what Zuckerberg says on there been reports that Facebook can track the users internet browsing activity even after that user has logged off of the Facebook platform can you confirm whether or not this is true senator I want to make sure I get this accurate so probably better to have my team follow up so you don't know I know that people who use cookies on the internet and that you can probably that activity between between sessions we do that for a number of reasons including security and including measuring ads to make sure the ad experiences are the most effective which of course people can opt out of but not entirely and entirely opt out of it so I don't mean to crucify Zuckerberg everybody's picking on him because he's kind of weird-looking and he's obviously one of these you know computer geniuses he's a little offbeat but that but that's not the point he shouldn't be there the only reason he was called the only reason he was called there was because Donald Trump won the election and the the big state doesn't like it when I say that I don't mean that it's like in some kind of conspiracy every time you use the term deep state or big state people picture those scenes in the movies where two guys in a trench coat sit in a bench in Washington and arrange an assassination that's not what it is it's bureaucrats who never get fired and look at the elected officials like a passing fad they you know what are they there for and Trump is annoyed them and Trump has cut some of their power a lot of their power really when you talk about the you know the regulations that he has cut back and they don't like it and all of this is about this an end it is about silencing a certain type of voice now we call that voice of conservative voices but in this case it really is the American voice it's the voice that says no we don't want to be governed by experts or if we are going to be governed by experts we want them to convince us first we do not want them to have the power as so many bureaucracies do to come in and tell me what I can do on my land what I can do with my property what I can do with my business without the fact without passing a law that's what we're fighting against so Ted Cruz god bless him god bless Ted Cruz to me I'm ready to bronze the guy I mean really he has been one of the really good actors and this is in spite of what President Trump said about him which was wrong during the election Cruz's worked with him he's done his best to keep the government going and he's done his best to continue to speak for his values which are our values that were my values at least and he gave it to Zuckerberg on the one issue that as far as I'm concerned that really matters which is the fact that Facebook has a virtual monopoly on information Google YouTube virtual monopolies on online information and they are censoring one kind of speech the speech that says to them you should not be all-powerful the people should rule here is Cruz in one of his finest hours mr. Zuckerberg I will say there are great many Americans who I think are deeply concerned that that Facebook and other tech companies are engaged in a pervasive pattern of bias and political censorship there have been numerous instances with Facebook in May of 2016 Gizmodo reported that Facebook had purposely and routinely suppressed conservative stories from trending news including stories about CPAC including stories about Mitt Romney including stories about the Lois Lerner IRS scandal including stories about Glenn Beck in addition to that Facebook has initially shut down the chick-fil-a Appreciation Day page has blocked a post of Fox News reporter has blocked over two dozen catholic pages and most recently blocked Trump supporters diamond and silks page with 1.2 million Facebook followers after determining their content and brand were quote unsafe to the community to a great many Americans that appears to be a pervasive pattern of political bias do you agree with that assessment senator let me say a few things about this first I understand where that concern is coming from because Facebook in the tech industry or located in Silicon Valley which is an extremely left-leaning place and this is actually a concern that I have and that I try to root out in the company is making sure that we don't have any bias in the work that we do and I think it is a fair concern that that people would would the let me wonder about let me ask this now should are you aware of any ad or page that has been taken down from Planned Parenthood senator I'm not but let me just move on another work sorry about moveon.org I'm not specifically aware of those about any Democratic candidate for office I'm not specifically aware I mean I you know I I frequently wonder and rant about the fact that the Wright doesn't build its own media if the Wright doesn't we sit around and we complain about Hollywood but we don't build a studio we sit around and we complain about the fact that Google is now unfairly ranking conservative content and unfairly fact-checking conservative content by liberal fact checkers like Snopes and politifact we rail about the fact that Twitter's shadow banning among others senator Cruz we rail about the fact that Facebook is shutting people down but we don't build Facebook we don't build Twitter we don't build Google and and therefore our complaints kind of sound ridiculous and I keep wondering why not why not I always four years three years I looked at Fox News and I thought this thing is so successful why isn't there a you know conservative comedy channel why isn't there you know consume a conservative movie studio if they we know that this is an audience base why don't we use it it just occurred to me that the reason is is the people who do this are the elites and you're asking them by supporting conservatives you're asking them to give up power to the people virtually one man has done that in history George Washington I remember the king said George the third said if he does that if he turns down the kingship basically he will be the greatest myth on earth and these people you know when you ask them to stop silencing Glenn back when you ask them to stop silencing Ben or me or any any conservative voice when you ask them to silence Planned Parenthood instead or at least allow right-wingers the same freedom of speech that Planned Parenthood and Media Matters have you're asking them to cede power and people don't do it and so the reason we don't build these things is cuz we're not the elites were the people I mean even the even the elites among us even the elites among us are the people the elites among us were are working for National Review they're not billionaires building stuff and so this is the problem and the problem with these tech guys is they are completely untouchable in terms of top high taxes and high crime nothing none of the wages of leftism are going to touch them they're not the ones whose behavior is going to be constrained at some poor schmuck out in Indiana in somewhere wherever what did what did Hillary Clinton call that Indianapolis or Indianapolis or something like that it's those people who are gonna get hurt by liberalism they're untouchable so why should they do it and I think that the only way to get them to do it is to make sure we keep the blue wave back if we can that we keep the people in government they get the people into government who will support the people because the elites they're just never going to exceed power all right we got the mailbag coming up but but we now have to cast you into the exterior darkness if you're on Facebook or YouTube come on over to the daily wired icon to listen to the rest I know you can listen on YouTube but the advantage of coming over to the Daily wire is that you can subscribe while you're there and then you can ask questions in the mailbag and then your life won't be the way it is right mailbag I just love doing that as fast as I can to see if I can throw them off how long it take them to get the Lyndsey alright the mailbag from Ethan dear his shininess my name is Ethan and I'm an up-and-coming electronic music producer and DJ with a morality question for you I've become successful enough to perform at venues clubs around the state and an unfortunate part of DJing my style of music is that rap hip hop music is often mixed in I despise where that genres going with his sex and drug ridden themes but I play it sometimes in my live mixes because it's what the crowd wants person to person I am the opposite of a hip hop rap artist Christian abstinent conservative and I consistently try to impact live so the better how should I deal with this issue of misrepresenting what values I stand for in my live performances thank you so much for taking my question love the show all right that's it that's a genuinely difficult question because you got to make a living and I understand that but you do not want to be in a position of putting forward values of being at odds with your own values now the arts are special because the arts include people saying things that we disagree with for a higher purpose in other words I write I write novels and stories that have evil people in it who say evil things use bad language some good people who use bad language and do bad things because I'm trying to produce a sense of what it's like to live as a human being I do not feel that that is contra my values those are my values this is my value to tell the truth in your case you are putting forward as a performance other people's works and I think you actually are responsible for culling some of that stuff out of what you do you know there's plenty of hip-hop and rap I hate the stuff I'm gonna be honest with you but there's plenty of hip-hop rap that doesn't front those kind of values that doesn't put forward the worst of the worst and I yeah I think I think you do have a responsibility to when you to go through some of that and make sure you're not playing the worst of the worst you know I mean it's not I'm not a and I don't expect you to be a prig about it I know the venue's that you're in but but still some of that stuff is violent vicious nasty stuff its treatment of women is unforgivable and unacceptable and and yeah I do not think that should be part of your act I mean that's my look I can only give you my you asked for my opinion I can only give you my opinion I do not think that it is right to take the worst of the worst and front it as as part of what you are doing and part of what you are communicating so I probably not the answer you want that that's what I think from Colleen hi I subscribed and was waiting right at 2:30 for the conversation to start but it started later and I had to go pick up my daughter and I didn't get to ask my question all right I love what you do with the daily wire my kids come running to listen to your theme song and I have thoroughly enjoyed listening to another kingdom this 30-something housewife gave it five stars however I do have a question about the scene where Austin is with the nymphs is there a deeper meaning there the scene reminded me of a kind of Baptism and evoked echos of Boerne knees ecstasy of Saint Teresa in what the artist in which in that the artist uses things of the sexual realm to more powerfully convey a deeper spiritual reality really intelligent question and I can only explain to why I can't answer the question I cannot answer the question because the right artists intention shouldn't get away get in the way of in my opinion of the audience's experience the artists intentions should not get in the way of the audience and because the artist does not always accomplish what he intends but sometimes accomplishes something far better than what he had in tents and so it's not my job to say to you what the scene meant to me it's your job to explore the scene which you seem to be doing a great job of doing and to understand it in terms of your own life and your own experience in your own reading and so I put a lot of stuff into what I write there's a lot of subtext there's a lot of understanding of other things that go into every scene I write but it's for you to kind of have that experience it's not really a puzzle it's not really a game where you have to puzzle it out it's more of an experience but I love the question or from Joshua dear Andrew I was in a long-distance relationship with a girl for two years I loved her we'd see each other every couple of months but in between those times I cheat on her I knew it was the wrong thing to do but I enjoyed it too much we broke up for reasons unrelated stayed apart for awhile but are now friends and talked to each other on occasion maybe she should know the truth I don't want to hurt her can you give me some advice ahead not gonna like my advice but you know this your problem is not what you tell her your problem is that you're kind of a weasel I mean that that's what you know it's a weaselly thing to do to betray your partner and then say gee I didn't want to do it but I liked that I enjoyed it too much I mean it's not a good reason that's a crummy reason so you behaved really badly now you could have said you know it's none of my business what relationship you have you could have told her this relationship is an open relationship and I don't see Cu enough so I'm going to go out with other girls and sleep with other girls you know that's none of my business but what you did was lie and you mistreated her and you betrayed her and so that's your problem that's the problem you're facing that you're that guy that is your problem you that you are that guy so your question is do I tell her now that we're friends that you're that guy my answer is stop being that guy stop being that guy now part of stopping being that guy is yes being honest with the people around you you know when you speak on it when you lie to your friends and the people you like you're bending the air in front of you you know you're the lens so that they can't have a clear relationship with you lies distort the atmosphere between people but your problem it that's a it's a subsidiary problem whether you tell her you should tell her because you should be honest and straightforward with everyone you deal with but that's your problem the problem is you should be honest and straightforward with everyone you deal with and enjoying lying and enjoying betraying somebody is just a it's a crap excuse that's that's what I think fix your life and then you'll know and you know it you'll know that you should be honest with her about this as about other things from Justin but never come on you right in here don't don't forget when you're under here you're coming here to be insulted Justin says benevolent overseer of the universe my girlfriend recently started antidepressants she had many deaths in her family this year which caused her depression it concerns me that her mood was brighter the day she started and she attributed that to the meds I know enough about them to know that it takes much longer than that for them to take effect and she was experiencing the placebo effect she's in a much better mood than she was before but I'm concerned about the long-term effects I appreciate any insight you can give on this all right I always have to start these things with telling you I'm not a doctor I don't want to get in the way of what doctors are prescribing but I am gonna give you my personal opinion on this a woman who has suffered family deaths is not depressed she's grieving that is a totally totally different thing and you know the grieving can lead to depression depression can be part of grieving but the person I you know I I don't even know if this was a psychiatrist or just a an MD who prescribed these drugs but to prescribe these drugs was it just to prescribe them was reckless and yes you're right that it does take a while for SSRI drugs to kick in and she probably was was experienced a placebo effect so she's been this stuff really ticks me off she's been prevented from experiencing her grief she's been presented prevented from working through her grief it's possible that some drugs might have been helpful in that process but that's not what's happening she's just essentially being drugged to keep her from annoying the doc so now you know what you want is to get her off but you can't do that without a doctor's help you can't do it without you can't do it by nagging her you can't do it by fighting with her you know it's just that she should be going to a mental health professional to help wean her slowly off these drugs and that is you know something you might want to try and arrange with her by saying to her that you would go into counseling with her and and help her do this because I just from your letter from the I don't know the whole story but just from the facts you're getting I'm getting from your letter it seems to me that somebody really miss stepped here and misused these drugs and she should be weaned off them but you're gonna need a doctor's help don't ever do it yourself because there's all kinds of bad consequences of doing that again I'm not a doctor I'm just reading your letter I'm not on the scene you know you want to get much much more expert and close advice before you do anything but if you want to get her off it you're gonna need a doctor's help all right from Ashley hey hi Andrew I've heard you say several times in regards to your conversion that you did not feel like you were a Jew until you found Christ paraphrasing would you please be able to elaborate what you mean by the statement yes and yes it's not that I didn't feel like I was a Jew right obviously racially I was a Jew what I didn't feel it was any connection to the religion of Judaism until I became a Christian why because I was raised as I tell in my book the great good thing I was raised in a household where we were taught the rituals of a form a moderate form of Judaism and we did celebrate High Holy Days but really my parents didn't really believe in God and my father mate was probably an agnostic my mother was a stone atheist and and whether or not whatever they believed God was not a presence in our family life we didn't pray when we go to went to bed we didn't say grace over dinner we didn't talk about what God wanted for our lives and why and who God was we didn't talk about any of those things and for someone like me to whom it is important that things make sense in her to whom integrity is important it it it made the religion make no sense so here I was an all-american boy all I cared about were was baseball and astronauts and playing soldier out in the back you know in sports that's all I cared about so why was I going to the school where they taught me a foreign language why was i listening to these hyper solemn people talk to me about Israel what was Israel to me it meant nothing to me without God you know Judaism is a beautiful religion but without God it's just an empty shell without God Christianity as an empty shell any religion is an empty shell without the reason for its being there's no reason and as far as I'm concerned I mean I know people talk about traditions but what do I care my traditions were American traditions my forefathers were Jefferson and Franklin and Washington those who and I went to school those weren't they were told me those are our forefathers and I believed that I was an American I was in the fully assimilated American so why were those tradition why did those traditions matter to me and ultimately I just felt completely detached from them when I returned to God when I returned to God through Christ I was worshipping a God who was came out of the Jewish tradition and reimagined it into a new covenant and so in accepting that covenant I was also connecting myself to the tradition that I have been raised in because now the tradition made sense to me in a way it simply hadn't before and that's what I mean what I mean is now it matters the the history of the Jews is a religious people and their journey as the chosen people of God matters to me in a way it simply didn't before because there was no God in my life and that God and we even after a while when there was a God he was just a generic God it was only an accepting Christ that he became the god of the Jews the same God of the of the Old Testament can I do one more let me see yeah yeah one more from Dane dear supreme overlord Clavin I have a love question for you my girlfriend and I are madly in love and want to get married someday however she and I are only 23 and she has already been through a marriage that didn't last and has some reservations about marriage she wants to still get married and have lots of kids but is now cynical that it that will ever happen for her it doesn't help when all of her friends marriages seem to be falling apart - my parents are still together and my grandparents loved each other till the day they died so I don't have this poisoned outlook on marriage what should I do to help the pessimism fear she's developed a marriage I just want to show her I'm not like those guys how do I do that that's actually I'm sorry but that's actually the wrong question yeah you know the problem here is that she has a problem it's not anything that you do obviously you want to treat her well and be a good boyfriend and possibly fiancee ah that's obvious but but she has a problem she has a problem it's it's indicative it's indicated by the fact that a 23 she has a failed marriage that she comes from such a culture of failed marriages that she is clearly she clearly has a damaged outlook toward this and what you have to do I'm sorry to say this we have to protect yourself a little bit here if if in treating her well and loving her you can move forward toward marriage and family and children in a safe sane way that's great that is absolutely great but you should be careful too that maybe she is not equipped to do that you know and maybe she act actually has a point maybe she's worried for a reason in your case what I would do is I wouldn't I wouldn't tell say this to her but I would say I'm gonna be a great boyfriend for the next year year and a half and I'm gonna watch and see where we are and if nothing has changed maybe it will be time for you to move on because you know she may not be equipped to four she may not be equipped for the things that she wants in life in which case you don't want to be drawn into that I know that's a hard saying but I just think that it doesn't help either of you if she has another failed marriage so what I think you should be watching for is whether she this is something that is just entrenched in her in which case you may need you know some kind of therapeutic care or whether it's a passing thing that you're treating her well and being a good boyfriend will cure there's nothing you don't have the power to change her attitude I think just be with her for a time and see what happens but if it turns out she's not gonna change I think you may have to you know step out the back jack all right let's move on to tickety-boo news so we here at the Daily wahoo made this montage mob did you make this okay we we here right right Robert Sterling Bob run our producer running working behind the scenes with a massive crew we put together this montage because what I wanted to show you is that creating crisis during a Republican presidency is what the media is about the idea is to make you feel that we are in a crisis when we are not right this minute we are not in a crisis there are lots of dangerous things happening in the world there are lots of things happening in the world that I don't particularly like but the idea that somehow the government is falling apart and Donald Trump is so outlandish that you know we cannot possibly stand this another day is taking place in the imagination of the media and their job is to draw you into their imagination so we put together this montage of people basically covering it's like you know Here I am I'm a reporter covering the inside of my own head so I just wanted to show you people imagining the crises because this this is only from the last week right I mean this is just stuff I collected over the last week just peddling to you the crisis that's in their heads face of John Bolton behind the president then I saw him in the next scene sitting next to him today and hit what kind of advice you get from Bolton attack exactly yeah what would any of us put it past a president Trump to decide that a nice little military adventure in Syria might be a nice distraction from this I mean they have a wag the dog Susan well Levinson last week I've been reminded he's the bit he's the director that felt where a president in fiction decided to start a little war to cover up for a hanky-panky the challenge is stiffer than any we faced in in my lifetime I remember the early 70s when President Richard Nixon was authorizing burglaries and fire bombing and break-ins and all of that and we survived that but this is something DIF let's say that Donald Trump decides he doesn't want to give an any view with Muller but mother says oh but you will and he's subpoenaed to interview Robert Muller and Donald Trump simply says I don't recognize that subpoena normally a person who refuses to testify before a grand jury how it winds up being incarcerated for the time period of the grand jury which is can be up to 18 months so one way to enforce it is to have Donald Trump taken by the federal marshals and put in federal prison until he testifies we're in a constitutional crisis the President of the United States has made clear to those around him is those who are closest to him in the White House and among his friends that he is determined to shut down this investigation and the moment he is chosen to actually act on it apparently is when the special prosecutor and other prosecutors have gotten hold of his lawyers computers which have perhaps evidence of real conspiracy between the President of the United States and others why is former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warning that President Trump could turn America into a fascist country having to live in perhaps a country that is that is Wow that's in decline and the face of that declension is a b-list reality I'm just glad I don't live in their heads that's all but thank you for this little tour of your putrid imaginations it's been great visiting now I'm gonna return to America where things are actually going pretty well I just love listen I feel bad for them but don't let them sell you their vision oh and Benjamin the comedian who has been under fire for his openly
