raka was the thriving city once prosperous rich and then Isis came and turned it into its capital they leveled it the us-led coalition leveled it 90 percent bombed and blasted to ruin and locals those that survived are still picking up the pieces the worst thing and I personally remember this from Mosul is the bodies hundreds thousands of them still rotting under the rubble the smell is indescribable and it permeates everything especially bad when it's hot and decomposition really sets in and there's a lot of bodies still to be found in this grave there are people of all confessions militants civilians children the elderly they were from all parts of society some of them were killed in the fighting some from the airstrikes others were killed by snipers Assad almas huge never completed his medical degree he spent the last seven months digging up bodies those buried in mass graves those they dig up from under the rubble experience not education his made him a pathologist day-in day-out he and his team dig up corpses with pigs shovels hammers over the course of the last several hours they had dug up 80 bodies Abbeville our minds are the main problem you can find them both in the buildings and on the streets the second problem is lack of equipment such a big city as wrecker needs more of it we're demanding the City Council give us as much equipment as possible so that we can expand the work it's no secret that things that die not enough assistance not enough help no one spared any expense when it came to carpet bombing Raqqa but they're counting now rescuers lack equipment financing safety gear and the international community has gone silent all but rights groups which have been banging the alarm bells for near enough now one of the main obstacles to actually exhuming these graves was the presence of landmine contamination and it seems that the process for the mining de mining these areas is very very slow there needs to be more support not just financial but also in terms of technical assistance and forensic expertise it appears that there is progress unfortunately and the progress appears to be slow and the resources that are necessary for it to be completed do not seem to be in place neither the human resources nor the financial resources it's a sorry situation so many dead so many missing and no one willing to bear any responsibility it's as America said you'll never know how many died in Raqqa as far as how do we know how many civilians were killed I'm just being honest no one will ever know anyone who claims they will know is lying you
