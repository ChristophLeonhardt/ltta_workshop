00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,589
hi guys so I'm finally learning how to

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:03,659
use my shiny camera I know I'm probably

3
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:05,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting a lot of things wrong but at</font>

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,740
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sort of know what the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iso is and</font>

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,349
the aperture and the depth of field and

6
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:12,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm getting better okay it turns out you</font>

7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,889
can't just read the manual twice and

8
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">like know everything we also have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

9
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,250
really nice sound effect of the water

10
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,900
pump in this room<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is something that</font>

11
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> learn to live</font>

12
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,600
with I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think and basically back at home</font>

13
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,580
basically stunning every day trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

14
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,800
write<font color="#E5E5E5"> CVS and getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> distracted there's</font>

15
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,230
too many<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in the world to distract</font>

16
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,789
me but over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past few weeks it's a</font>

17
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,140
hydrogen and my dissertation I've been

18
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,610
going out a lot with friends and seeing

19
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,930
lots of people and<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a really</font>

20
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,250
lovely time but then I was looking

21
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">through my photos</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and photos of the</font>

22
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,309
people have taken of me<font color="#CCCCCC"> there weren't</font>

23
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:39,750
really that money<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the last few</font>

24
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">weeks and I know at some point and might</font>

25
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,680
come to regret that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be honest</font>

26
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,239
it's been nice to sort of live in the

27
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:46,680
moment there's this thing that people

28
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,539
say I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really sure whether actually</font>

29
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,129
originally came from somewhere but it's

30
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:51,600
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea that if you're taking pictures</font>

31
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,129
of yourself having fun at the club<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

32
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:54,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're not having fun at the club I</font>

33
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,520
associate that with my friend Brian not

34
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,989
because i think it something he does<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

35
00:00:57,989 --> 00:00:59,190
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's something that he said you're</font>

36
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,539
tweeting at some point it's left me

37
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,219
relying on a different kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> record a</font>

38
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:03,960
different kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> memory equally as</font>

39
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,570
temporary in and in a way equally is

40
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,760
permanent and that is the tradition of

41
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,950
retelling stories and passing them on to

42
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,659
be telling them not necessarily as

43
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,880
gossip just retelling those<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying funny</font>

44
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,590
stories that mark your time at

45
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">university in other places if i were to</font>

46
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">say to you that my last couple of weeks</font>

47
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,049
at university have been concentrated on

48
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,780
strengthening my oral history then the

49
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,159
comments would probably be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

50
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,119
glog slur so vulgar all back hypocrite

51
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,070
and my<font color="#CCCCCC"> response would of course be thank</font>

52
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,049
you / Shakespeare but that's not what

53
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:35,189
I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about I'm talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

54
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:37,530
Homer sort of home and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea that if</font>

55
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,820
you have to take pictures of yourself

56
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,409
having fun at the club you're not having

57
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:41,850
fun at the club<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the beginning of</font>

58
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,409
second time one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my lectures was like</font>

59
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,360
take pictures take these physical

60
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,430
memories of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and extra before</font>

61
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,439
you go and although I've had such a fun

62
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,659
few weeks I have a grand total of three

63
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,670
pictures all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> which were taken on a</font>

64
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">camera phone I get his point because I'm</font>

65
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna want to go back and identify these</font>

66
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,920
people and remember specific things

67
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,630
associated with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> photographs and</font>

68
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,189
those nights<font color="#E5E5E5"> out but at the same time I</font>

69
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,750
am<font color="#E5E5E5"> really glad that I didn't spend three</font>

70
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,670
weeks holding my camera up to my face I

71
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,649
have become<font color="#E5E5E5"> more fluent in my stories</font>

72
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:09,179
and in my friend stories of our time at

73
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:10,619
University and all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that go</font>

74
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:11,420
along around

75
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,340
I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> people through those stories and</font>

76
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,810
yeah none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those droids are malicious</font>

77
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,540
or salacious just funny stupid sweet

78
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,190
ridiculous<font color="#E5E5E5"> University stories</font>

79
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,260
occasionally a little bit disgusting but

80
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,489
there we go a different one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my</font>

81
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:23,930
friends pointed out to me how judgmental

82
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,400
universities and I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

83
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">true but what these last few weeks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

84
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,540
allowed me are those stories without the

85
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,870
judgment there so often the judgment is

86
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,940
so often applied to all and so while I'm

87
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,860
sure they'll be a pointer which I wish

88
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,050
I'd taken more pictures or more videos

89
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,290
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the moment I'm pretty happy with my</font>

90
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:45,080
choice to listen and to retail and to

91
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,239
share my own stories because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

92
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:48,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is so much virtue and listening</font>

93
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,510
and that is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we forget and</font>

94
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,310
while I do aim to get some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font>

95
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">stories captured on camera and to share</font>

96
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,480
them before i leave University for good

97
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,870
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the moment you</font>

98
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,250
know it's like when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get your gigs</font>

99
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,780
these days and you see people holding

100
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,940
out cameras and not really dancing along

101
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,160
I'm not really paying attention to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

102
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">immediate experience I'm guilty of that</font>

103
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,310
sometime and you understand it because

104
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,480
you do want to keep these movements

105
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,510
forever but by keeping it forever you're

106
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,489
not keeping it for yourself now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

107
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:18,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">just think it's really weird and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bizarre</font>

108
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:19,489
and I think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull ourselves</font>

109
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:22,190
away from that sometimes I say this as

110
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:25,850
someone who documents their life so I

111
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,410
hope you were keeping well I'm nearly to

112
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,970
the end of perfume I'm reading it really

113
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,890
slowly because it's just so creepy and

114
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:31,940
I'm going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use this thing</font>

115
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,340
bit more so that my lips don't turn

116
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,790
different colors and my face isn't glowy

117
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,799
and you know all of all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

118
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:41,600
but it might mean that I have to wash my

119
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,880
hair before I meet videos which will be

120
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,440
sad hi guys the iso is up way too high

121
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,670
right now hey I love you with Christian

122
00:03:52,670 --> 00:00:00,000
Stewart on it
