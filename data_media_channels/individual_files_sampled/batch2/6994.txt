March sign is right-winger he goes on fox news all the time I likes to go on Tucker Carlson's program which has become a hub a base it can't be fuel up perhaps an al-qaida of white supremacy now I think the word white supremacy is a little overused I've talked about that on the show before in this case it is not it is literal so let me show you what mark Stein said and then explain the context let's watch there was a French novel published 45 years ago by Jean Raspail the camp of the saints a lot of people on the Left don't like it but it actually predicted what's happening before I write so he's saying that the camp of the Saints is a good book their predicted what's happening but the blast doesn't like it but it's real all right well let's find out what the camp of the saints is so Southern Poverty Law Center is read it they say it is the favorite racist fantasy of the anti-immigrant movement in the u.s. now the job is held them properly Law Center is to attract hate groups they also explain that it is revered by American white supremacists now okay these guys have been doing it for a long time they track these groups but now the right wing since they are white supremacist in a lot of ways not all of them obviously but certainly Mark Steines and apparently Tucker Carlson is and and they talk about this whole time Steve Bannon and talks about camping the Saints non-stop and so since they are race this they go down I don't know something about Law Center tracking races it doesn't count well okay then let's go to Linda Chavez now Linda Chavez worked for Ronald Reagan in his cabinet and George W Bush in his cabinet it is she's a revered significant right winger she said that the book is really shockingly racist okay fine you don't even want to trust any other Republicans or right-wingers let's go to the book itself on the cover of the book in the English translation it explains that it is quote a chilling novel about the end of the white world now that's on the cover of the book they're bragging about it oh no the immigrants are gonna end the white world oh wait wait wait wait I'm gonna quote the book for you guys I have a clear sense of what these guys are such big fans so first we go to an exploration by outposts the plot of the camp of the saints follows a poor Indian dama named the turd eater you didn't see that wrong because he literally eats crap and the deformed apparently psychic child who sits on his shoulders okay so the leader of the immigrants eats crap and is called the turd eater okay we're just warming up well what happens with them together they lead an armada of 800,000 impoverished Indians sailing to France dithering European politicians bureaucrats and religious leaders including a liberal Pope from Latin America debate whether to let the ships land and accept the Indians or to do the right thing in the books vision by recognizing the threat the immigrants pose and killing them all the book thinks the right thing is to kill 800,000 immigrants to protect the white world and they brag about it on TV I'm not done they explain poor black and brown people literally over on Western civilization in the book once the Indians land in France then Chinese people pour into Russia the queen of England is forced to marry her son to a Pakistani woman the mayor of New York must house an african-american family at Gracie Mansion now this was written in the mid 1970s now part of the reason that the right wing is freaking out is we do have a liberal Pope from Latin America the Prince Harry in England is marrying a biracial woman and hence the Queen is forced to have at least someone of a different race in her house and the mayor of New York does house an african-american family in Gracie Mansion his own so they're like we knew it what did you know you racists that black people could live in Gracie Mansion that a black woman could be married to the mayor of New York well earlier we had a black mayor anyway I know you despise that idea but this is there all of their heart horrific nightmares come true oh my god the Queen to be forced to have a Pakistani woman in her house Chinese people in Russia oh this is disgusting we should have murdered them all the hero the book wanted to kill them all he winds up killing a liberal I'll get to that in a second but in here's a quote from the book about what was happening in the ship of immigrants they say that they are sexual deviance and the book writes everywhere rivers of sperm streaming over bodies losing between breasts and buttocks and thighs and lips and fingers so it's sick in a thousand different ways and finally the main character right before he kills the liberal who's in favor of immigrants the hero of the book is a murderer who kills liberals who are in favor of immigrants and they brag about it on Fox News in a speech he gives to the liberal he's about the murder he says that scorn of a people for other races the knowledge that one's own is best the triumphant joy at feeling oneself to be part of humanity's finest none of that had ever filled these youngsters at all the brains right they're literally saying white supremacy is great and it's so sad did these addled brains of the liberals don't understand how supreme their own races and how they should be proud to be above the other races well that is the definition of white supremacy and in case it wasn't clear enough here's Mark Steyn on the same target Carl says show back in January listen to what he says the white supremacists are American citizens the illegal immigrants are people who shouldn't be here it's also note for the record the March sign is an immigrant from Canada all right well it is absolutely clear dr. Carlson heard that comment in January very happy to have him back on the program where he then Lords the camp of the saints a deeply racist we're proud to be racist Breitbart has written many articles praising camp of the saints so all these right-wing guys these alright the mark Stein's the Steve ban is a Tucker Carlson's they are put away the dog whistle there now just flat-out saying it and you might not know camper the Saints that's partly why I do this story for you guys just to give you an understanding of what they're doing but those guys the right wing they know it so when mark stain on a sign now says on Fox's camp of the Saints is coming true a lot of the people in law Trico yes the immigrants are coming in in fact truck just warned about a caravan of immigrants coming into the country kind of look at our mana of immigrants coming into France and where'd he get that from he got it from Fox News and the Marx eyes of the world and Tucker Carlson's of the world are telling their fellow white supremacists it's time to act against those immigrants and if the camp of the Saints is their guidebook whoa watch out they might be white supremacist but they've got brown shirts you just watch the video by The Young Turks the home of the revolution if you'd like to get the full show come join us and become a member tea white tea network.com slash join
