DIRECTION THIS MORNING TO THE PRESIDENT FULFILLING MAJOR CAMPAIGN PLEDGE TO RENEGOTIATE ONE OF AMERICA'S BIGGEST TRADE DEALS, NAFTA. HERE'S A PRESENT TOUTING A NEW DEAL CALLED THE USNCA. IS MY GREAT HONOR TOSUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED NEGOTIATIONS ON A BRAND-NEW DEAL, TO TERMINATE AND REPLACE NAFTA. THE AGREEMENT WILL GOVERN NEARLY 1.2 TRILLION IN TRADE. WHICH MAKES IT THE BIGGEST TRADE DEAL IN THE UNITED STATES HISTORY. MARIA: NOW THE AGREEMENT FEATURES US, MEXICO AND CANADA RAISING QUESTIONS OVER THE ONGOING U.S. TRADE DISPUTE WITH CHINA. WHAT WILL THAT LOOK LIKE WITH A UNIFIED GROUP? JOIN ME RIGHT NOW IN AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH LARRY KUDLOW, ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT FOR POLICY AND DIRECTOR NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL. LARRY, ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU, MARIA. THANK YOU! MARIA: LET'S TALK FIRST ENTRCE. OBVIOUSLY A BIG DEAL THAT CANADA GOT THIS DONE AND THE NEW USNCA IN PLACE. WHEN YOU EXPECT THE AMERICA PEOPLE TO FEEL THE EFFECTS OF THIS NEW TRADE DEAL? WELL, LOOK, IT HAS TO GO THROUGH SOME PAPERWORK AND A VOTE. AND CONGRESS. BUT, THE KEY POINT HERE, IS THAT THIS NEW DEAL OPENS UP A LOT OF MARKETS FOR AMERICAN FARMERS, A BIG HELP TO AMERICAN WORKERS, MAIN STREET, BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS. MUCH BETTER CONDITIONS. MUCH BETTER RESOLUTIONS, IT OPENS UP FINANCIAL SERVICES, DIGITAL SERVICES. I THINK IT IS A VERY GOOD DEAL AND I THINK NOW OF THE SUPPLY CHAINS IN NORTH AMERICA ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK OUT WELL. THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WANTS TO HELP THE NEGOTIATE BETTER DEALS . I THINK THIS IS A GOOD TEMPLATE FOR THAT. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WHAT IT SAYS, USNCA. WE'LL HAVE TO MEMORIZE THAT. IT SHOULD NOT BE TOO HARD. I SAY PROGROWTH BUT IT WILL TAKE A WHILE TO KICK IN. MARIA: WE'VE ALREADY SEEN STRONG PROGROWTH POLICIES LIFTING ECONOMY. WE HAVE THE JOBS NUMBER UP ON FRIDAY. WHICH SOME PEOPLE QUESTION BEING A LITTLE LOWER THAN EXPECTED BUT THE PRIOR TWO MONTHS WERE REVISED UPWARD. HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THE JOBS PICTURE RIGHT NOW AND THE ECONOMIC GROWTH PROSPECT? I THINK IS PRETTY REMARKABLE! YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT THE REVISIONS. PRIOR MONTHS, SEPTEMBER IS ACTUALLY 211,000 ABOVE AUGUST. THAT IS A BIG NUMBER. REMARKABLY, 3.7 PERCENT UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, WHICH WE HAVE NOT HAD FOR DECADES, VERY RARE. THERE IS BASICALLY NO INFLATION. HERE IS THE POINT, A GOOD STORY IN THE PAPER. YOU KNOW, THE LOWER END IS ACTUALLY GETTING FASTER WAGE INCREASES. I THINK THESE ARE PREDOMINANTLY MARIA, BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS. LESS THAN SOME OF THE TECH PEOPLE. BUT THERE ACTUALLY GETTING FASTER WAGE INCREASES THEN THE UPPER END. AND THAT IS PRETTY REMARKABLE, I THINK. WE'VE SEEN THIS THROUGHOUT BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS, A BIG STORY IN THE PAPER A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS HAVE THEIR BEST INCREASE IN MANY YEARS. PRESIDENT TRUMP YOU KNOW, HAS OPENED UP THE ECONOMY. LOWERED TAX RATES, DEREGULATION, LOW ENERGY, HE STOPPED THE WAR AGAINST BUSINESS. HE STOPPED THE WAR AGAINST SUCCESS AND ENERGY. NOW THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IS CRUSHING IT AND IT WILL GO ON FOR A WHILE IN MY JUDGMENT. MARIA: FOR A WHILE IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE QUESTIONING. THERE'S A NARRATIVE AS YOU KNOW, THINGS WILL START TO SLOW DOWN PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY GOING TO 2020 AND IN 2020 BECAUSE OF HIGHER INTEREST RATES AND THE DEMOGRAPHIC ISSUES. DO YOU SEE THAT SLOW DOWN ON THE HORIZON? I SURE DON'T! 2020 IS A COUPLE OF YEARS AWAY. I THINK THAT WE ARE IN THE BIGGEST CAPITAL GOODS BUSINESS INVESTMENT SPENDING IN 20 YEARS, OKAY? THIS IS AN ECONOMY ALSO IGNORE THE 80S AND 90S. WE BE IN THE TWO PERCENT GROWTH MARGIN EVERYONE SAID THAT WE COULD NOT. THEY SAY IT WILL BE FOUR PERCENT AGAIN IN THE THIRD QUARTER. OUR TEAM WILL TAKE THREE PERCENT PLUS. THEY SAID IT COULD NOT BE DONE AND IT IS BEING DONE. CAPITAL GOODS IS GOING TO PUT BETTER PRODUCTIVITY TO OUR WORKERS, WE ALREADY SEEN THE WAGE GAINS. CONSUMER SPENDING IS HOLDING UP. I JUST DON'T SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING TO END. ONE LAST POINT.IF YOU CAN KEEP MORE OF WHAT YOU EARN, RIGHT? IF YOUR PAYCHECKS ARE BIGGER AFTER-TAX, AFTER INFLATION, THAT GOES ON. IF WE ARE BUILDING NEW BUSINESSES, PLANTS, EQUIPMENT, TECHNOLOGY, CAMPUSES, YOU NAME IT. WHY CAN'T THAT GO ON FOR A GOOD MANY YEARS? WE HAVE NOT HAD THAT IN ALMOST 20 YEARS. MARIA: ONE ISSUE IS THE TRADE FIGHT WITH CHINA, THAT PRICES ARE GOING UP FOR SOME COMMON GOODS THAT PEOPLE BUY BECAUSE OF THESE TARIFFS IN PLACE. I KNOW IT IS MORE THAN JUST AN ECONOMIC ISSUE. WE HAVE GOT A MAP HERE OF THE SOUTH CHINA SEA. BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE ISSUES MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING IS ONE FOR AMERICA WITH REGARD TO NATIONAL SECURITY. CHINA IS BUILDING ISLANDS IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA. WHICH WE ALL KNOW. IT IS BUILDING ISLANDS AND THAT IS WHERE A MILITARY BASE IS. WHAT IS YOUR TAKE WHERE THIS FIGHT WITH CHINA, WHERE GOES NOW THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE THIS DEAL WITH CANADA AND MEXICO? AND I WENT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON EUROPE AND JAPAN AS WELL. LOOK, THE WHOLE STORY ON TRADE IS COMING TOGETHER NICELY. THE PRESIDENTS STRATEGY APPEARS TO BE WORKING. WE SEE THIS WITH USNCA. WE ARE HOLDING TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH EUROPE, JAPAN, THE THREE COUNTRIES BASICALLY SAYING, NONMARKET ECONOMIES, THEY HAVE GOT TO SHAPE UP. CHINA IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST CULPRIT, AS YOU KNOW. LOOK, THE KEY ISSUES HERE, HIGH TARIFFS, TECHNOLOGY THEFT. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT. THERE IS A STORY IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL YESTERDAY. CHINA EXPANDS ITS CYBERSECURITY RULEBOOK. HEIGHTENING FOREIGN CORPORATE CONCERNS. THIS IS BRAND-NEW. THEY ARE PUTTING IN NEW RULES THAT WILL PREVENT CHINESE OFFICIALS TO INSPECT U.S. COMPANIES AND ALL FOREIGN COMPANIES INFORMATION TECH AND ACCESS PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. THIS IS EXACTLY A STEP IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. THIS IS FORCED TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER. THIS IS IP THEFT, THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE BEEN WARNING ABOUT. WE TRIED TO COMMUNICATE THESE CONCERNS TO CHINA. SO FAR, WE HAVE NOT HAD LUCK. WE WILL TALK TO THEM, SERIOUS SIGNIFICANT TALKS ANYTIME. BUT IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE THEY ARE MOVING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION RIGHT NOW. I THINK THIS IS MOST UNFORTUNATE. YOU TALK ABOUT NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES, WE CAN TALK ABOUT ECONOMIC SECURITY ISSUES. WHY SHOULD WE ALLOW THE CHINESE TO OWN AMERICAN COMPANIES IN CHINA AND MOREOVER, FORCE US TO LAY OUT ALL OF OUR TECHNOLOGY BLUEPRINTS AND IN THE NAME OF CYBERSECURITY WHICH BY THE WAY, THEY CYBER HACKED US CONSTANTLY. WHY SHOULD WE GIVE THEM NEW ADVANTAGES IN THIS RACETRAC MARIA: WE ARE BACK WITH LARRY KUDLOW. YOU ARE DEALING WITH A DICTATOR FOR LIFE IN CHINA. CHINA WILL NOT ADMIT THEY BEEN STEALING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND FORCING TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY. ARE YOU SURE TARIFFS WILL BE THE THING TOACTUALLY MOVE THE NEEDLE ? LOOK, I DON'T KNOW. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN VERY STRONG ON THIS ISSUE. A LOT OF PEOPLE BLAMING POTUS FOR IMPOSING TARIFFS AS PART OF THE TRADE STRATEGY. HE IS FIRST AND FOREMOST A TRADE REFORMER. AS I THINK THAT YOU KNOW. WE HAVE GIVEN CHINA OUR ASKS. ANY NUMBER OF TIMES. REGARDING TECHNOLOGY ISSUES AND IP AND TARIFFS. AND THE TRADE IMBALANCES AND SO FORTH. I THINK YOU KNOW THAT TOO. MY ADVICE IS, DO NOT BLAME TRUMP, HELP US. DO NOT HURT US, HELP US BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD, RECIPROCITY. CHINA REGRETTABLY, IS NOT PLAYING BY THE RULES. AND HAS NOT PLAYED BY THOSE RULES FOR MANY YEARS PRIOR TO U.S. PRESIDENTS GIVEN SERVICE, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GIVEN THE TOUGHEST REBUTTAL AND ACTIONS AGAINST THEM. YOU HAVE TO PROTECT THE U.S. ECONOMY AND TECHNOLOGY IN FAMILY JEWELS. YOU HAVE TO PROTECT OUR WORKFORCE AND THE BUSINESSES. THAT IS THE STRENGTH OF AMERICA'S FREE MARKET ECONOMY. THE PRESIDENT IS DOING JUST THAT. MAYBE A SIT DOWN AT THE G 20 IN ARGENTINA, MAYBE NOT.I WILL PUT THAT OUT THERE. OUR ALLIES ARE WORKING WITH US, THE EU AND JAPAN. REALLY, OBJECTIVELY. YOU HAVE TO GIVE THE PRESIDENT CREDIT ON THIS. HE HAS TAKEN THE FIGHT TO CHINA
