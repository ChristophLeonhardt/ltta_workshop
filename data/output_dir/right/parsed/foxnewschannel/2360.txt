AS HE AWAITS HIS PUNISHMENT.
HE FACES UP TO 30 YEARS IN
PRISON.
ABBY?
ABBY: THANK YOU, JILLIAN.
TWO OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
MOST VOCAL SUPPORTERS
ADDRESSING QUESTIONS FROM
CONGRESS ABOUT THEIR
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN.
LISTEN.
>> THE CAMPAIGN OF DONALD J.
TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT
INCORPORATED PAID DIAMOND
AND SILK.
>> UM-HUH.
>> $1,274.94 FOR FIELD
CONSULTING.
>> UM-HUH.
>> ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH
THAT?
>> WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH THAT
PARTICULAR LIE.
WE COULD SEE THAT YOU DO
LOOK AT FAKE NEWS.
WE MONETIZE OUR PLATFORM.
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH
THAT AS YOU AS AN
AFRICAN-AMERICAN, YOU ARE
NOT GOING TO MAKE US FEEL
GUILTY BECAUSE WE'RE GOING
TO GET OUT HERE AND WE ARE
GOING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
THESE PLATFORMS JUST LIKE
EVERYBODY ELSE.
STEVE: AFTER THAT EXCHANGE,
SOME CLAIM THEY LIED UNDER
OATH AND THAT WAS THE
HEADLINE IN A NUMBER OF
PAPERS.
BRIAN: IS THAT THE CASE?
BRIAN: HERE TO ADDRESS THAT
STORY ON CAPITOL HILL ARE
THE SUPER STARS THEM SERVICE
DIAMOND AND SILK.
GREAT JOB, LADIES.
JUST AS COMPOSED AS EVER.
JUST ON THE MONEY EXCHANGE,
DID THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN PAY
YOU?
DO YOU WANT TO SET THE
RECORD STRAIGHT FOR
EVERYBODY THAT MISSED THE
HEARING.
>> WE HAVE NEVER BEEN PAID
BY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
BRIAN: WHERE DO THEY GET
THIS FIGURE FROM?
STEVE: WHAT HAPPENED WAS,
YOU WERE REIMBURSED FOR
LIGHTS, RIGHT, FROM YOUR
HOUSE TO OHIO.
IT WAS ALL ON THE UP AND UP.
AND THEY REFERRED TO IT IN
THE ACCOUNTING AS FIELD
CONSULTING BUT REALLY IT WAS
JUST TO GET YOU TO AN EVENT,
RIGHT?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
IT WAS JUST TO GET US TO AN
EVENT.
AND ON TOP OF ALL OF THAT
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, THEY PUT
OUT A STATEMENT ON
YESTERDAY.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> WE HOPE THAT ALL OF THESE
SALACIOUS, GOSSIP NEWS SITES
AND NEWS ORGANIZATIONS LIKE
THE VERY FAKE NEWS.
>> YEAH.
>> RETRACT ALL OF THEIR
LIES.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
ABBY: TELL US ABOUT HOW
YESTERDAY PLAYED OUT.
DID YOU GET WHAT YOU
ULTIMATELY WANTED OUT OF THE
HEARINGS YESTERDAY?
WHERE DO YOU WANT THIS TO GO
FROM HERE?
>> NO, WE DIDN'T.
BECAUSE, LET ME YOU
SOMETHING.
WHAT WE WERE APPALLED AND
REPRESENTATIVES SIGNATURES
THERE AS IF WE HAD NO MERIT
AND NO CLAIM AND THEY WERE
BEING VERY DISMISSIVE.
I THOUGHT THEY WORKED FOR
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
WHY ARE YOU QUESTIONING ME
ABOUT A FEC REPORT?
HOW MUCH MONEY DID MARK
ZUCKERBERG ALLEGEDLY PAY YOU
ALL?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD
HAVE BEEN QUESTIONING.
WHY ARE YOU QUESTIONING US
ABOUT THAT AND NOT
QUESTIONING US ABOUT HOW WE
WERE CENSORED.
THEY WERE TOTALLY
DISMISSIVE.
I FELT OFFENDED AS AN
AMERICAN, BORN ON THIS SOIL,
THAT FIRST BLACK PEOPLE --
THAT DON'T WANT US TO OBTAIN
THE AMERICAN DREAM AND,
SECOND, THEY DISMISSED OUR
CLAIM, YES, A DACA PERSON
CAN GO UP THERE THAT'S NOT
EVEN BORN ON THIS SOIL AND
THEY LISTEN ALL DAY.
SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.
BUT, LISTEN, WE'RE NOT GOING
TO BE SILENCED.
>> NO, WE'RE NOT.
>> WE'RE GOING TO KEEP
TALKING OUT AND SPEAKING OUT
AGAINST PEOPLE THAT TRY
CENSOR PEOPLE'S FREE SPEECH.
>> WE ARE VERY THANKFUL TO
THE WHITE REPUBLICAN THAT
ALLOWED US A SEAT AT THE
TABLE TO SPEAK OUR TRUTH
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON UNLIKE
THE BLACK MEN.
AND THE REASON WHY I SAY
THAT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN
ON THE DEMOCRAT PLANTATION.
WE KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE OVER
THERE THEY ARE THE ONES THAT
CONDITION BLACK PEOPLE'S
MINDS TO MAKE US THINK THAT
WHITE REPUBLICANS DON'T WANT
US TO WORK, DON'T WANT US TO
HAVE ANY MONEY IN OUR
POCKET, BUT IT WAS A BLACK
MAN THAT WAS CONCERNED ABOUT
HOW MUCH MONEY DIAMOND AND
SILK WAS MAKING AND WAS
APPALLED ABOUT US MAKING
MONEY LEGALLY.
>> AND IT AIN'T NOTHING
WRONG WITH AFRICAN-AMERICANS
OBTAINING THE AMERICAN
DREAM.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHY WE VOTED
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP.
IT'S TIME FOR BLACK
AMERICANS TO COME UM AND
STOP SAYING STUFF LIKE CHUCK
LISTENING TO THESE BLACK
REPRESENTATIVES.
>> WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT
WHITE RACISM.
IT'S BLACK ON BLACK RACISM.
BLACK PEOPLE NEED TO CHECK
THEIRSELF FIRST.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
BRIAN: WHAT CONGRESSMAN ARE
YOU REFERRING TO.
HERE IS SHEILA JACKSON LEE
IN THE EXCHANGE THAT THE
THREE OF YOU HAD, LISTEN.
>> HAVE YOU EVER BEEN PAID
BY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN?
>> NO.
WE HAVE NEVER BEEN PAID BY
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
>> HAVE YOU NEVER BEEN PAID
BY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN?
>> WE HAVE NEVER BEEN PAID
BY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
>> NOT $5?
NOT $100.
>> WE HAVE NEVER BEEN PAID.
>> 1274.
>> WE HAVE NEVER BEEN PAID
BY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
>> LET ME ASK A SPECIFIC
QUESTION.
$1,274.94?
>> WE HAVE NEVER.
>> THANK YOU.
>> BEEN PAID.
STEVE: SHE WAS LOOKING AT
SOMETHING THAT SAID FIELD
CONSULTING THAT FIGURED YOU
WERE CONSULTANTS.
THAT'S NOT THE CASE.
IT WAS, AS YOU SAID A MOMENT
AGO, IT WAS TRAVEL EXPENSES.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> THEY DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR
THAT.
>> NO.
>> THEY WANTED US UP THERE
TO ANTAGONIZE US ABOUT
FOOLISHNESS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> AND NOT TALK ABOUT
CENSORSHIP.
>> WE NEVER PROFITED OFF
THAT PARTICULAR
REIMBURSEMENT.
THAT WAS STRICTLY FOR FLIGHT
