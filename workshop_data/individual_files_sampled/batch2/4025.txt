what a day in court yesterday what a day so help us out with the Sean Hannity deal why would Sean Hannity's name be dragged into all of this what would coincide because we've heard now twice from two legal experts one who you worked with Jonathan Turley that Sean Hannity's name wasn't dragged into the public because of something that the Southern District of New York did but it was one mistake after another from Trump's own lawyers why was his name dragged into this well the irony Jo is is that they effectively threw him under the bus by way of their conduct and what they what they did I mean they teed Hannity up really on a silver platter and where we are well I mean Michael Cohen's attorneys and you know that and the Trump attorneys to a lesser degree I mean they really teed him up and here he awakes now this morning and he's got this scandal to deal with but he says it's privileged that there was a small you know it's a nothing he wasn't a client he never paid a bill why would his name be in there in the first place well you gotta have your client make a you gotta understand the context in which that this came up last Friday the judge asked for the names of the clients for which they were seeking to protect documents based on the attorney-client privileged documents okay that's a critical critical issue because what this means to me is is that the reason why Sean Hannity's name was disclosed yesterday is because there are documents relating to whatever legal advice Michael Cohen gave Sean Hannity and they're seeking to protect those documents under the attorney so so they're they're actually they may be used Hannity may be telling the truth maybe he never was a client but you have actually Trump and Cohen trying to protect those documents from discovery by claiming an attorney-client privilege that may or may not exist Joe I think that's absolutely right but let me say this I don't understand how you how you square Sean Hannity's comments relating to him not being a client with the representations that were made to judge would by a federal judge that he it was a client I don't understand how you square you well I again if if what your it sounds like if they're trying to protect documents it sounds like they misrepresented they could have misrepresented their position to the judge so they could protect documents right correct I mean Sean Hannity may have never been a client and they may be seeking to call him a client because they don't want these documents to get out there in the ether that show whatever they show and we don't know what they show but you cannot square the representations that were made a judge would with the representations that we're hearing now from Sean Hannity they don't scrape either the president's lawyers are lying or Sean Hannity's lying well or Michael Cohen's are Michael covered correct what a mess what the president's lawyer yet though they're unsquare both so one side has to be lying I agree how do percent you said last night at the end of all this as we start to I look forward right you said last night you made two predictions one prediction was Mike Holmes gonna get indicted in the next 90 days and the other is that Mike Owens gonna roll the president please explain that you're the reasoning behind both of those predictions well I think this investigation has taken on an enormous amount of momentum I think the amount of information that was obtained is significant from what I from what I've heard from what I've seen there's no question that Michael Cohen's gonna be charged it's only a question of when and I think it's going to happen within the next 90 days based on my experience in white-collar criminal investigations and prosecutions the likelihood of him not rolling over is very very slim I can't imagine he's going to go to trial or potentially face 10 15 20 25 years in a federal penitentiary for anybody let alone a guy Donald Trump who left him behind when he went to Washington DC I mean don't don't forget that Michael Cohen was supposedly his right-hand fixer etc and when Donald Trump was finally elected he blew Michael Cohen off Michael Michael go and wanted to work on the campaign he was stiff-armed wanted to go to Washington DC he was stiffed arm because Trump didn't think he was good enough to be in Washington and so how many how many times how many times are you stiff-armed before you say as they say in Italian basta enough you think Michael Cohen's wife is going to advise him to take a twenty-year bullet for the president what about no matter what about his Jill I mean listen Donny Deutsch knows Michael : and we know other people that know Michael Cohen he loves his kids he loves his family and he loves his kids more than he loves Donald Trump I understand the loyalty and all that other stuff that only goes so if they only goes so far when your own children are saying dad what's going on it's either Trump or not what your kids grow up what are you gonna pick when they that question is put to you on the Hannity question as far as you know does Michael Cohen cover real estate law you know with each passing day we find out that Michael cone covers all kinds of things that he probably shouldn't be covering so I don't think I don't think he covers any law well well I ask only because Sean Hannity said yeah we had a casual conversation about real estate and I may have given him ten bucks you were on the show with us sitting right here about a month ago I asked you if you had any doubt in your mind that the Perez the United States been the nominee directed the payment to stormy Daniels through Michael Cohen $130,000 you said you had no doubt in your mind you still feel that way absolutely now more than ever I mean I think the last four weeks have shown that that our predictions and what we've stated was true is is is true in fact and I think that we've been vindicated along the way and I think our record of predicting what was going to happen in this situation is damn near Pro so you did the big 60 minutes interview you've been on TV a bunch why haven't we seen any even a hint of evidence that the president directed it but because this is a piece of litigation and we're being strategic in the way that we handle it and we're being methodical just like any other case we're not going to just show up on national television and lay out all of our evidence etc I mean you know Joey I know you've had some criticisms along the way of the way that we've handled this from time to time I mean this is a very special case it's a very unique case if I try a case in South Carolina I'm not going to necessarily try that same case in the same way if I find it in Los Angeles it all depends on the facts and the circumstances in this case calls upon a very special skill set and we're utilizing that skill set let me say one other thing as it relates to how much media attention and publicity that we've received and that and that we've participated in you know up until about six weeks ago the American people had only heard from one side the president michael cohen mostly from michael cohen and what we did five or six weeks ago joe was that we sent a message and the message was this my turn right it's my turn enough of the nonsense and the lives of the American people about what happened in connection with this payment and we're going to continue to control the narrative and the microphone until somebody rips it from our hands now Michael I said during the Republican primary to the Republican candidates and I have said to Democrats now that the only way you beat Donald Trump is you stay in his face you knew the four corners who smother him you stay on him you keep hitting him and so yeah I I was critical I have been critical from time to time but as John and I were discussing last night it seems that you have outplayed Donald Trump at his own game time and time again so I mean there is the legal side of it but when you're going after Donald Trump obviously there's also public relations is very important and I will say on this score it has anybody have we seen anybody since Donald Trump has become a public figure two and a half years ago a political figure getting Donald Trump's face more so that is effective especially when you get the attorneys miss playing their hands so no I appreciate that I mean let me just say one thing though we're not gonna get complacent I mean we're in the middle of the first cloud lot of football left to play here I expect you treatment toward women and I too was critical of you but you only mentioned Joe so I'm gonna announce I was critical with the CD thing that you put out a video DVD whatever I mean are you putting anything out in the course of this case including that that does not ultimately have the goods in it now that would be foolish and if you think I'm bluffing you should ask opponents that I've litigated against for 18 years and they'll tell you a lot of things about it some positive some negative but they will tell you absolutely I do not Bluff yes people to believe that we would see that on 60 minutes no I actually now I'm gonna push back because I could not do that what I did not lead people to believe they would see that on 60 minutes I was very strategic in what I did we fired a warning shot mica to Michael Cohen and the president by sending that DVD out to basically say if you if you make a public announcement or if you come out after 60 minutes and you call into question the veracity and the honesty of my client there's gonna be consequences and and you know what the warning shot worked and again and again we were critical of that but I will say in terms of PR it worked because Donald Trump has remained silent and his lawyers have made one mistake after another and again it's the reason why Sean Hannity's name was dragged into the public because the mistakes they made so you revealed on this show that stormy Daniels allegedly was physically threatened and today you will have more on that a sketch of this person that's correct getting closer to knowing who this is I certainly hope so my client sat down with Louis Gibson who's a world-renowned forensic artist she has the world record and for the most identifications and we're gonna release that sketch later this morning along with the details of the assailant tomorrow we're gonna release the details of the reward that's going to be offered in connection with that and we're hopeful I mean we're up not on that four yard line first and goal from the floor we're hopeful that the public's gonna come forward and help tighten up that identification for us and get us over the goal we're there any witnesses Michael to that fret no not that we don't and any security footage from the parking lot important like that unfortunately not is this potential assailant someone a name that you have in mind we have some names in mind but we're not going to release them right now but people that are associated have been associated with the Trump Organization in the past I want to be really careful I'm not I'm not going to answer that right now I'm not being coy but I don't want to you know I don't want to put the spotlight on somebody right now what did you say so there has been an absolute media storm over your client what does she want I'll ask that question again we've gone through all of this look at them Mike the press scrum break it down for people again who were just asking what's this all about what does she want well at this point she wants the truth and 100% the truth she wants the American people to have all the facts Joe relating to the payment what the president knew when he knew it the details of Michael Cohen's conduct the threats the intimidation and look to the extent that there's a counter narrative or a counter set of facts that the president or Michael Cohen wants to put forward let him come forward and let's just lay it all out on the table the American people are smart they'll sort it out you said you were looking at other women potential other NDA's other payoff says have any of those panned out you've had a couple of weeks well we've we've netted eight of them a couple of them seem to be very very solid we haven't made a determination week as to whether we're going to represent these other women there's some positives associated with that but there's also some negatives you know we have our hands full relating to representing miss Daniels and I think we've done a good job at these payoffs around the same time as the ones that were made to the one that was made to stormy Daniels I don't want to get into the details of that cliff I got one more question for that you said you have evidence that the president directed these payments is it directly from the president and is it explicit or is it from another party representing the president I think it's from a surrogate I think that's the best way for me to put it but but that I don't want to exclude the fact that there may be additional direct evidence I mean we're in the early stages here and let me say this we still have our motion pending relating to taking the deposition of Michael Cohen and the president and if that motion is granted and we're given the opportunity to take those two depositions I think they're gonna make what happened yesterday the courtroom with Sean Hannity look like a warm-up lap what's the possibility of you getting the president in front of you to depose him well I think at this point it's pretty good and with each passing day it only gets better based on their conduct and the mistakes they make I mean every time we set a trap that they step right in the center of it it's really remarkable I've never gave that why is that why is it that the president this president does not I mean we talked about it off-camera as you were walking on just briefly this president doesn't get the best in the brightest representing him that's a little matter and and that's what he promised the American people was that he was going to surround himself with the best of the brightest but look in in administration's past the president United States could call almost any law firm in the United States any prominent law firm and immediately get an agreement to represent him and put 20 people on the case and I'm talking about chess players people that I'm used to going up against in other cases people say to me what are you most surprised about in this case I'm surprised about the level of competition on the other side thus far I expected something far greater all right Michael Evan I think a lot of people who voted for him day thank you thank you I
