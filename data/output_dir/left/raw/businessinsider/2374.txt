00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,990
welcome back we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just get</font>

2
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,760
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on your questions right now</font>

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">the first one from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our reader tripping</font>

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,090
asks will Wall Street ever have the

5
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,250
robust air of bravado and capitalism

6
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,330
again or will imitate<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it once was</font>

7
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,350
following the Washington<font color="#E5E5E5"> DC dictates</font>

8
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,579
this actually fundamentally

9
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,559
misunderstands the relationship between

10
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,050
business and government Wall Street

11
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,690
isn't following diktats from Washington

12
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,660
DC<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's dictating to washington d.c the</font>

13
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,059
policies that it thinks will help it

14
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:51,360
make the most money government and big

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,730
business work<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand-in-hand to rip you</font>

16
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,989
off if you really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check out a</font>

17
00:00:56,989 --> 00:00:59,850
great example of this you should read my

18
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,629
younger brothers book obamanomics in

19
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:06,360
quality bookstores everywhere next

20
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,049
question do you believe government stats

21
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:13,560
are unmanipulated of course government

22
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,350
stats are not unmanipulated the very

23
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,409
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> of collecting things like the GDP</font>

24
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:22,430
or unemployment all aggregate stats are

25
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,130
manipulative in their very function<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

26
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,420
real economy doesn't work like that it's

27
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,920
individuals exchanging things with each

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">other anytime</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you try to create a giant</font>

29
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,689
aggregate economic statistic you're

30
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:39,170
manipulating things just from the start

31
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,939
next question do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think that Goldman</font>

32
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:43,770
is unfairly bashed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mainstream</font>

33
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,740
media it depends exactly what you mean

34
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,899
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I do think that Goldman Sachs</font>

35
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,860
has managed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money in</font>

36
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,649
part because it is getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> very cheap</font>

37
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,770
cheap funding from the government on the

38
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,079
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand I don't think that they are a</font>

39
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,479
vampire squid manipulating markets that

40
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:07,399
is and destroying American capitalism

41
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:10,889
that so yes they probably are being

42
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,640
unfairly bashed

43
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,770
partly just<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of jealousy over their</font>

44
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,490
success next question this one comes

45
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,130
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Goldman employee should i spend</font>

46
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,770
my bonus money on a Bentley or an Aston

47
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">Martin obviously you should buy an Aston</font>

48
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:31,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">Martin I know James Bond you know in his</font>

49
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,459
the very first James Bond book Casino

50
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:36,520
Royale he drove a Bentley but these<font color="#E5E5E5"> days</font>

51
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,330
Bentley's are<font color="#CCCCCC"> for gangster rappers if</font>

52
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,130
you really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a quality cargo</font>

53
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:46,000
for the Aston Martin next question is it

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,420
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sell yet hmm let's see tails</font>

55
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:58,510
it's time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sell next question if mr.</font>

56
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,880
Spock or a financial<font color="#CCCCCC"> advisor what school</font>

57
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,380
of thought would he find the most

58
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,050
logical I think Spock would be a

59
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:09,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-frequency trader next Dave and</font>

60
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,100
Denver in which direction will water

61
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,630
spin when you flush a toilet in

62
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,140
Australia clockwise or counterclockwise

63
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,829
trick question<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dave actually the volume</font>

64
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:24,160
of water in a toilet is too small to be

65
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,500
affected by the Coriolis effect what

66
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,840
really happens and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> really controls</font>

67
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,040
the direction of which way<font color="#E5E5E5"> the water</font>

68
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,430
spins is what way the<font color="#CCCCCC"> water is directed</font>

69
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,860
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the toilet it doesn't matter which</font>
