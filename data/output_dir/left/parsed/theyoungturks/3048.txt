JAILS AND PRISONS THROUGHOUT
THE UNITED STATES ARE DOING
AWAY WITH FACE-TO-FACE
VISITATION AND REPLACING
FAMILY VISITS WITH TECHNOLOGY
THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO EITHER
VIDEOCONFERENCE OR MAYBE EVEN
CALL IN TO SPEAK TO AN INMATE.
THERE ARE A LOT OF PROBLEMS HERE
AND THEY HAVE TO DO WITH
COST AND ALSO THE FUNCTIONALITY
OF THE TECHNOLOGY THAT IS
PUT OUT THERE.
THERE ARE MASSIVE CORPORATIONS
BEHIND THESE TECHNOLOGICAL
ADVANCEMENTS AND OFTENTIMES THEY
STAND TO MAKE BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS IN SWITCHING FROM
FACE-TO-FACE VISITATION TO
TECHNOLOGICAL MEANS OF KEEPING
IN TOUCH WITH THESE INMATES AND
IT'S A HUGE INDUSTRY.
WHEN
IT COMES TO THE PRISON PHONE
SYSTEM, BRINGS IN $1.2 BILLION A
YEAR FOR THESE CORPORATIONS.
NOT EVERY PRISON IS DOING THIS,
BUT THE TREND WILL ESSENTIALLY
CONVINCE YOU THAT MORE AND MORE
PRISONS ARE HEADED IN THAT
DIRECTION.
AN ANALYSIS FOUND
THAT AS MANY AS 600
JAILS AND PRISONS ARE THE UNITED
STATES HAVE ALREADY STARTED
IMPLEMENTING THIS TYPE OF
TECHNOLOGY.
NOT ALL OF THEM HAVE COMPLETELY
PHASED OUT FACE-TO-FACE
VISITATION BUT THEY ARE HEADED
IN THAT DIRECTION.
SO LET'S BREAK DOWN UPSIDES
AND DOWNSIDES.
A CLEAR UPSIDE IS HEY, A LOT OF
TIME THESE PRISONS ARE VERY
FAR FROM WHERE THE FAMILIES
LIVE.
TO BE ABLE TO SKYPE IN COULD BE
REALLY POSITIVE.
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THAT POSITIVE
STORY AND FIND A WAY TO
MAKE A SOUL CRUSHING.
CONGRATULATIONS, OUR PRISON
SYSTEM HAS.
NUMBER ONE, NOW YOU ARE NOT
ALLOWED TO SEE THEM IN PERSON.
BUT HAVEN'T WE CRUSHED OUR
PRISONERS ENOUGH?
YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT SOME OF
THEM HAVE DONE TERRIBLE
THINGS BUT OTHER COUNTRIES
BELIEVE IN REHABILITATION.
WE IN AMERICA HAVE TOTALLY GIVEN
UP ON THAT CONCEPT BUT SOME
OF THEM ARE NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS
AND THEY SMOKED A JOINT AND
NOW, OH MY GOD, IF YOU DON'T
LISTEN TO THE GUARDS THERE,
GOD KNOWS WHAT THEY THINK, ETC.
THEN YOU ARE GOING TO GET
IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT AND NOW
YOU CAN'T SEE YOUR LOVED
ONES AND IT JUST CRUSHES YOU AND
QUESTIONS YOU AND WHY?
TO ME THE MOST IMPORTANT
QUESTION HERE IS WHY?
IS IT JUST TO BE GRATUITOUSLY
MORE DEMEANING TO ALL OF
OUR PRISONERS AND STRIP ANY
HUMANITY THEY HAVE?
NO, THAT'S A POSITIVE SIDE
EFFECT FOR THE EVIL PEOPLE
THAT RUN THESE PRISONS HONESTLY
IS EVERY WARDEN EVIL?
NO.
BUT THE SYSTEM OVERALL IS GROSS.
IT IS.
THERE'S A PROFIT MOTIVE THERE
AND THERE'S A PROFIT MOTIVE
SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PRISONS
WHETHER THEY ARE PRIVATE
PRISONS WERE RUN BY THE STATE,
THEY STAND TO PROFIT FROM
IT BECAUSE THEY GET A
COMMISSION.
THEY GET A PORTION OF THE MONEY
MADE FROM THIS PHONE OR
VIDEO CONSEQUENCE IT IS NOT AN
ACCIDENT THAT THEY ARE
CUTTING OFF YOUR PERSONAL
VISITS.
IT IS NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY WANT
TO CRUSH HER SOUL, THAT IS
THE SIDE EFFECTS AS I WAS
TELLING YOU.
THE MAIN REASON IS AND IT IS
ONLY GERMAN BY PROFIT.
IF YOU CAN'T SEE THEM IN PERSON,
YOU MUST DO THESE CALLS AND
BY THE WAY, THE TELEPHONES ARE
ALSO INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE,
TELEPHONE CALLS FROM INSIDE
PRISONS THAT NIGHT HAVE A
SKYPE CALL IT IS EVEN MORE
EXPENSIVE.
YOU FORCE THEM INTO A PLACE
WHERE YOU WERE GOING TO
MAKE MORE PROFIT FOR THEM.
SOME OF THE PRISONS HAVE WAGES
FOR THE PRISONERS WHO WOULD
LIKE TO WORK.
AS HIGH AS A DOLLAR A DAY.
SO YOU WOULD HAVE TO WORK
13 DAYS, ALMOST 2
WEEKS STRAIGHT TO EARN ONE 20
MINUTES SKYPE CALL.
AND BY THE WAY, THE PEOPLE
WHO PAY FOR THOSE CALLS IN THE
BEGINNING AND INITIALLY ARE THE
FAMILY MEMBERS SO THE FAMILY
MEMBERS ARE NEEDLESSLY GETTING
PUNISHED WITH THIS FINANCIAL
BURDEN JUST TO KEEP IN TOUCH
WITH THEIR LOVED ONES WHO MIGHT
BE LOCKED AWAY FOR WHATEVER
REASON IN SOME CASES, CRIMINAL
BEHAVIOR, BUT AS WE KNOW, IN A
LOT OF CASES NONVIOLENT
OFFENDERS WHO END UP BEING
HARDENED CRIMINALS BECAUSE OF
THEIR PRISON SENTENCES AND BY
THE WAY, JUST KEEP IN MIND
THAT RECIDIVISM IS SOMETHING
THAT EVERYONE SHOULD CARE
ABOUT BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT
PEOPLE TO CONTINUOUSLY GO
BACK-AND-FORTH, GO TO JAIL, GET
OUT, GET INCARCERATED AGAIN
BECAUSE WE AS TAXPAYERS PAY FOR
THAT.
SO IF YOU CARE ABOUT OUR
RESOURCES BEING PUT TO GOOD USE,
WE SHOULD FOCUS ON DOING
WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO
DECREASE RECIDIVISM AND MAKE
SURE THAT THEY HAVE AN EASIER
TIME GETTING BACK INTO SOCIETY
AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS
TO ENSURE THAT THEY STILL HAVE
REGULAR COMMUNICATION WITH THEIR
LOVED ONES ON THE OUTSIDE AND
RIGHT NOW THE SYSTEM THAT
WE HAVE SET UP IS OPTIMIZED FOR
RECIDIVISM.
AND LOOK, AGAIN, ACROSS THE
POLITICAL SPECTRUM, YOU
KNOW WHY THEY ARE DOING THIS.
THERE IS NO LACK OF CLARITY AT
ALL.
THEY'RE NOT EVEN PRETENDING IT
IS A SAFETY ISSUE OR ANY
OTHER ISSUE.
IT'S JUST YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO
SEE HER FAMILY ANYMORE SO
WE CAN CHARGE YOU MORE MONEY.
THAT IS NOT WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE DOING WITH OUR PRISONS.
THEY HAVE CREATED A LOT OF
PROFIT MOTIVES GUYS, TO PUT
MORE AND MORE OF US IN PRISON.
IT'S NOT JUST THE PRIVATE
PRISONS, IT'S EVEN IF
YOU'RE IN A PUBLIC PRISON, THEY
GET TO MAKE MONEY OFF YOU
BY DOING SCAMS LIKE THIS SO IF
YOU CREATED A PROFIT MOTIVE FOR
PUTTING PEOPLE IN PRISON, WHAT
YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE?
MORE PRISONERS AND THAT
IS WHY AMERICA HAS A
RECORD-BREAKING RATE OF
PRISONERS.
WE INCARCERATE MORE PEOPLE
THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN
THE WORLD, PERIOD.
