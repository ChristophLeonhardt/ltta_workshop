I completely a hundred percent understands why the perception of the broker has become so bad there's a lot of licensed real estate agents in New York City there is probably like 20,000 of them to have a license doesn't really require much doesn't require that much education or even sensibility for common sense and I think that someone who doesn't ask the right question someone that doesn't show you credibility with the buyer that they're working with and someone that's afraid of giving you specific and certain information it's is for the most part not real everything in Manhattan is luxury so a luxury apartment luxury this luxury that I think the word luxuries completely has completely lost his defense definition because everything is luxury so I think that you really have to understand the inventory you know every building to be able to understand whether or not any description that it's been given to any listing is really accurate or not because obviously every broker needs to talk about their listing like it's the last coca-cola in the desert I already filter the word luxury and high-end and one-of-a-kind and top-of-the-line and all these words that brokers tend to overuse brokers are very valuable now for those of you who don't think that they need a broker you're wrong you actually do need an advisor just like you can rip go to court on represent it you can't go to this market and represent that either you just need to make sure you pick the right broker with the right credibility the right access the right knowledge the right understanding and the right reputation that would allow other people to open the doors to be the first one in so call me haha
