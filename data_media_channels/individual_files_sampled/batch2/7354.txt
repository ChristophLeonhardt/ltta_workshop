JAPAN'S POPULATION CONTINUES TO SHRINK AND PART OF THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE THE BIRTH RATE IN THE COUNTRY IS INCREDIBLY LOW AND THAT IS A PROBLEM THAT WE HAD BROUGHT UP AND TALKED ABOUT ON THE SHOW QUITE A BIT. HOWEVER, IT IS HAVING A REAL NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY IN JAPAN. THE WORKFORCE NEEDS MORE WORKERS AND EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE POPULATION SHRINKING, THERE'S ALSO THE ISSUE OF FOREIGN WORKERS. JAPAN DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF FOREIGN WORKERS AND SO AS A RESULT, OWNERS OF COMPANIES ARE TRYING TO THINK OF CREATIVE WAYS TO GET PEOPLE WHO DO NOT TYPICALLY WORK BACK INTO THE WORKFORCE AND THEIR FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON HOUSEWIVES. THERE ARE A LOT OF CONVENIENCE STORE TRAINS OR FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS THAT ARE NOW TRYING TO ENGAGE WITH HOUSEWIVES AND THEY ARE TRYING TO CONVINCE THEM TO COME BACK INTO THE WORKFORCE AND GO THROUGH SOME TRAINING JUST SO THEY CAN HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO RUN THEIR COMPANIES. CAN I JUST SAY, THAT IS A TERRIBLE SLOGAN. MCDONALD'S: NO PROBLEM. WHY, WAS THEIR PROBLEM? THEY ARE TRANSLATING IT FROM JAPANESE. I AM SURE IT MEANS I KNOW IT'S A PAIN IN THE ASS TO WORK, BUT DON'T WORRY, WE WILL BE FLEXIBLE, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? MAYBE THAT IS A BETTER TRANSLATION. ONE EXECUTIVE AT MCDONALD'S SAYS: I'M GLAD THERE ARE NO STEREOTYPES IN THERE. IN JAPAN THE PAY GAP IS PRETTY BAD THAT IT IS THE SECOND WAS COUNTRY IN TERMS OF A GENDER PAY GAP AMONG ECONOMICALLY DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. OBVIOUSLY YES. BUT THAT PROBABLY SPEAKS TO WHY THAT TYPE OF, IS OPENLY MADE AND PEOPLE DO NOT CRITICIZE IT. NO QUESTION. SOUTH KOREA BY THE WAY IS THE WORST IN DISPARITY BUT TO BE FAIR TO THE JAPANESE, THEIR FEMALE PARTICIPATION RATE IN THE ECONOMY IS HIGHER THAN OURS SO MORE WOMEN WORK IN JAPAN THAN THEY DO IN THE UNITED STATES. THAT'S KIND OF BANANAS. ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF HOUSEWIVES IN THE WORKFORCE IN JAPAN IS ABOUT 20%. THE PERCENTAGE OF JAPANESE WOMEN IN THE WORK FIRST EXPERIENCED A SHARP DROP ONCE WOMEN IN INNER THEIR 30S FROM 80% AGE 29 TO JUST OVER 71% FROM THE AGES TO 38 TO 39. AS THEY GET OLDER AND THEY HAVE KIDS THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE IN THE WORKFORCE HOWEVER, THE LEADER OF JAPAN IS TRYING TO CHANGE THAT BY MAKING CHILDCARE MORE AVAILABLE, BY ENCOURAGING WOMEN TO GO OUT THERE COME INTO THE WORK FIRST AFTER THEY'VE KIDS AND AGAIN, JAPAN'S FEMALE LABOR MARKET PARTICIPATION RATE HAS SURPASSED THAT OF THE UNITED STATES AND IS NO LONGER LOW COMPARED TO OTHER ADVANCED COUNTRIES. AND FINALLY TO STAND GIVING THEM CREDIT, IT IS SHINZ? ABEÃ­S PLAN AT WORK THERE, IT BROUGHT MORE WOMEN INTO THE WORKFORCE WITH A VERY SIMPLE IDEA. THEY HAVE KIDS, ESPECIALLY THE OLDER WOMEN WHO THEN WANT TO GET INTO THE WORKFORCE AFTER INITIALLY HAVING KIDS YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM CHILD SERVICES. ONCE YOU DO THAT IT TURNS OUT THEY WANT TO WORK BUT HERE IN AMERICA WE ARE LIKE NO, YOU CAN BARELY TAKE ANY TIME OFF AND IT MIGHT NOT BE PAID AT ALL OF YOU HAVE KIDS. IN THE BEGINNING AND THEN LATER, CHILDCARE. WE'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU CHILDCARE. HERE ARE SOME BOOTSTRAPS. IT TURNS OUT IF YOU DO CHILDCARE, MORE WOMEN WILL WORK DIANE MAKES SENSE. LOOK, ABE SAW THAT AS AN ECONOMIC SOLUTION WAS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES IT IS NOT SEEN AS THAT. IT ABSOLUTELY IS. IF YOU WANT MORE WOMEN TO GO OUT THERE AND NOT FEEL BURDENED BY THE COST OF CHILDCARE, YOU WANT THEM TO BE PART OF THE ECONOMY, TO BE PRODUCTIVE. BY THE WAY, PEOPLE WHO STAY HOME AND TAKE CARE OF THEIR KIDS ARE ALSO PRODUCTIVE BUT I MEAN SPECIFICALLY ECONOMICALLY PRODUCTIVE. IF YOU WANTED TO HAPPEN, YOU NEED TO MAKE IT A LITTLE EASIER ON THEM. WE DON'T HAVE MANDATORY MATERNITY OR PATERNITY LEAVE AND WE ALSO CAN'T AFFORD, MOST OF US CAN'T AFFORD HOW EXPENSIVE CHILDCARE IS RIGHT NOW THOUGHT IT IS SO CRAZY EXPENSIVE. HOW DO PEOPLE DO IT? IF YOU HAVE KIDS, WHAT DO YOU DO? IN THE BIG CITIES IS INSANE AND IF YOU DON'T LIVE BY YOUR PARENTS AND FAMILY, YOU ARE TOTALLY SCREWED AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT GOING TO HELP YOU. NOBODY IS. GEE, I WONDER WHY THE YOUNGER ADMINISTRATION THINKS THE MIXED ECONOMY IS NOT ABOUT IDEA.
