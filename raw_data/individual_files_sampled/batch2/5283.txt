what you're seeing is I think the athletes are showing patriotism through their community service you know the president is turning all this stuff into a political game and a ratings game and it's a blatant display of nationalism I've blown away by the irony of the Eagles being disinvited instead we just have these military sing-alongs at the White House to show how patriotic we are even though we don't know the words it's just incredible yeah by we he means president Trump just did not know the words you saw out there welcome to morning Joe we start this way on Thursday June 7th with us on the set we have national affairs analyst for NBC News and MSNBC John Heilemann the polity thank you could help they could give him a prompter yeah politics editor for The Daily Beast Sam Stein when I say he doesn't read I mean he doesn't read and the former aide to George W Bush White House and State Department's Elise Jordan is with us Joe we've a lot to get to this morning new poll numbers from NBC News Melania Trump's makes an appearance after a long absence and the president has some interesting tweets about that might understand it was horrified at the thought that people were wondering yeah interesting would be on where they just Scarborough had interesting riposte I liked it we all did yeah I thought there's brats on Heilmann it was shocking I mean Donald Trump is correct I mean John who in the world would be so cruel so hateful right it would be so so despicable who would be so utterly lacking in character no to make something up about someone having a facelift for the sole purposes of trying to damage or humiliate and I just I know that I mean it's nice to finally be able to agree with the president this guy that I've known for over 10 11 12 years - he's in the White House so I finally they says something I agree with yes you would have to be utterly despicable a classless man yeah to say that about a woman's total scumbag maybe you have to be just a protest you have to be the most graceful this asinine person in the world just a petty life yeah but here's the thing Joe I just liked it I just like to ask you this question that beyond I mean it's the the obvious hypocrisy of it given the history which we're all alluding in an optical available way it's also kind of amazing because I don't know that anybody in any respectable publication or anyone of note on Twitter this is actually suggested that they didn't about Melania Trump so this is not yet it's not just hid hypocritical but it also falls into the ever-growing category that I will refer to henceforth as animals of trumpian projection and by the way what would be wrong with that I mean Willie it is it is I I don't understand why would Donald Trump why would the first thing Donald Trump think of the first Bell he would ring yeah be that anybody in his family would be missing because of plastic surgery nobody suggested that nobody in as John Heil and said I never read it I didn't even know that like anybody even thought that until Donald Trump suggested that hateful despicable human beings were being being unfair to the first lady by suggesting that that she had plastic surgery because certainly I read no one I've never had anybody suggesting that that's why she was absent I should recuse myself because I've had extensive work done yeah I really think top to bottom I go in every summer and just have kind of a full makeover done I just saw bleating yeah yeah from the face look there were there was a bazaar let's say focus on the whereabouts of Melania Trump i but I didn't see any mainstream outlet suggesting that she was missing because of plastic surgery you might have seen a Twitter user or somebody at a dinner party suggesting that but for Trump to repeat the conspiracies in his tweet was a bizarre way it was all very delicious and it also points to what he reads he must read a lot of gutter stuff and Twitter also ahead we do have a lot to get to far more important than this but that was rich Trump blaming the wrong country for burning down the White House yeah during the war of 1812 yeah vice president I guess he doesn't know the words - god Bless America but he does know his history but wait there's more by the way I got I gotta say I gotta say though you know McGann about the god Bless America thing we're not even talking about like when you get to the heart of God Bless America mm-hmm like Willie he starts stumbling on land that I love like it's like it's not it's not that he fells in to stretch the gate opens and the horse just lies down as far as the Canada thing goes Donald Trump is a South Park character come to life you know the the famous South Park Lincoln sounds like he's he's and there were actually some conservatives saying well you know that Canada was actually a part of part of the British Empire at the time and they bragged about burning down Kent as the British the British burned down but that shows you just how stupid some of Trump Trumpets defenders are that they're actually striking out for anybody bringing up the fact that Great Britain yes Great Britain burned down the White House and you can't defend Donald Trump one guy quoted a Smithsonian article that actually had in the body of it Great Britain burned down the White House well Canada wasn't a nation until 50 years later I think it's an honor to point out it was a British well as you ready to prove you rarely say the thing about the words not to get mired and his not knowing the words - god bless america let's get the facts that he arranged that event write expressly for the purpose of celebrating that song and patriotism and using the United States Army Band and everything else he's like we will see songs that Patriots exactly we will find them it's painful and you know Myka for all those trying to say well you know Canada actually Donald Trump was right Kenan actually burned down the White House that's like saying yeah and New Mexico scaled the cliffs of Normandy yeah yeah they were a part of so anyway yeah I was just laughing you talked about Donald Trump you talked about Donald Trump not reading though yeah I'm sorry we're gonna get to what Rudy Giuliani said in the ignorance of the things that Rudy Giuliani has said and that just the the other worldliness of the things that Rudy Giuliani has said but we have a President of the United States that actually he's not only insulted our closest ally Canada but also gets on the phone and doesn't even know US history about Canada saying what you guys burned down the White House something that's so disturbing about the Canada reference is now he's been living in the White House for a couple of years and one of the most famous stories that you always hear is the picture that Dolly Madison saved a George Washington during the War of 1812 so you would think that just by osmosis and living in the White House he would pick up a lot of this basic information but he's not even picking up the history and it makes you wonder what he's not picking up about the wars that were involved in around the world he's not interested in every kid that's gone to the White House is basically herded I mean yes Britain Britain burned down the White House but Dolly Madison cut out the picture of Washington rolled it up passed it out the win and that was like our big win it was a bad night for us we were like the cows only heroic story we had was Dolly Madison was able to cut out the picture and put it through the window and boy we sure did show the Brits of course they burned they burned the White House down to the ground but we got the picture out of it so no way if every schoolchild that ever walks through the White House knows that how did how is Donald Trump so oblivious well I think about how oblivious he is and think about all the sink events who suck up to Trump who take loyalty oaths who feel that if they do what he says he wants them to do that they will get ahead it's incredible the guy doesn't know his history he doesn't he can't even get the words to the song and our next story that we're teasing our lead is about Rudy Giuliani but we're teasing resident Mike Pence who cannot help himself he loves what Donald Trump does with water bottles and so with Donald Trump puts his water bottle on the floor he will do that right now this is incredible and this is where we're at y'all also ahead eh Joe loves chicken Phil a chicken leg let's just say I know I know I don't know why I call it that looks like some tenders took 10 minutes just to get through all the stories we're going to get you before me go yeah while this is going so well and everybody's talking let me jump in just to say I guarantee you today Mike Pence will come out today and he will he will also say that it was Canada and that that burned down the White House and he will find articles like some trumpets last night of course articles saying well yes well you know the Canadians always said it was in retribution for the burning of Toronto well actually now even in those same articles it's Great Britain burned down the White House but expect a history lesson from Mike Pence today yeah maybe they could just get him the words thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more 4 Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
