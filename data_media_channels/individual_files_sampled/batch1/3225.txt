the first thing is to note which countries are actually bordering on the South China Sea and then distinguish those from the ones that actually make claims I'm Dave denoon and I'm the director of the NYU Center on us-china relations the ones who are actually claimants are the Vietnam Malaysia Taiwan Brunei and the Philippines and of course China has on various maps drawn what they call the nine dash line which covers the areas they claim as their it's a very complicated situation about one-quarter of the world shipping goes through that area the second element is that there may be both oil and natural gas the third is the strategic importance of the islands it's hard to describe these caves and and reefs without saying the word island there was a decision by the international tribunal of the law at sea in July of 2016 China's claimed was not valid under international law the rock outcroppings don't qualify as Islands that means they don't qualify for a 12-mile territorial sea it also means they don't qualify for an exclusive economic zone so none of the countries including China is entitled to an exclusive economic zone in the region China however did not abide by the ruling and has gone ahead with the construction of these military outposts what China is trying to do is occupy enough of these islands so that they can bring its Navy down and their Air Force down to try to dominate the area if there's a crisis at the moment the American 7th Fleet is the dominant military power but over the next say 20 to 30 years China will become more and more important you you
