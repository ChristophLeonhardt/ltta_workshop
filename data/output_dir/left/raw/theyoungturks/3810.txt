1
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:13,350
DONALD TRUMP ASKED FOR A LOT
OF MONEY AND HE GOT A LOT OF

2
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,350
MONEY.

3
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:19,270
THE US MILITARY BUDGET BACK A
DEFENSE POLICY BILL PUMPING

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:46,190
$700 BILLION 
INTO 

5
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:47,190
THE MILITARY.

6
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,590
HERE IS A BREAKDOWN.

7
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,630
SO THEY SHORTCHANGED HIM 28
BILLION.

8
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,800
BUT WHAT IS THAT WHEN YOU DON'T
HAVE A PARADE YET.

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,860
WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE NEXT YEAR'S
REQUEST.

10
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,400
WHAT STRUCK ME ABOUT THIS, THESE
BILLS HAPPEN ALL THE TIME.

11
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,610
THEY ARE VERY CONTENTIOUS MOST
OF THE TIME.

12
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:12,850
AND I THINK THIS IS THE TYPE
OF THING THAT MEMBERS OF

13
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,070
CONGRESS DON'T LIKE VOTING
AGAINST BECAUSE IT CAN BE

14
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,950
USED AGAINST YOU ON THE CAMPAIGN
TRAIL.

15
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:22,600
THIS MONEY IS NECESSARY TO KEEP
THE MILITARY GOING.

16
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,400
WHAT IS NOT NECESSARY IS THE
SECOND PART OF THE NUMBER,

17
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,540
ALL THOSE MISSIONS.

18
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,370
IN THIS ARGUMENT THAT
REPUBLICANS ARE MAKING IT ABOUT

19
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:36,080
HEALTHCARE, THEY ARE SAYING THAT
SINGLE-PAYER HEALTH CARE IS THE

20
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,530
WRONG WAY FOR AMERICA TO GO.

21
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:44,990
THIS IS UNCHECKED SINGLE-PAYER
$700 BILLION EXPENDITURES.

22
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,990
THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

23
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,329
WE CAN PAY FOR OUR MILITARY AND
DEFENSE IN A SINGLE-PAYER

24
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:51,390
KIND OF WAY.

25
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,619
WE CAN DO IT FOR HEALTHCARE.

26
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:56,800
IF THE RIGHT TO DEFEND YOUR
COUNTRY IS A RIGHT THAT WE

27
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,829
ARE ALL BORN WITH, SO IS THE
RIGHT TO REMAIN HEALTHY

28
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:01,700
THROUGHOUT OUR LIFE.

29
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,229
THERE BOTH TO KEEP US ALIVE.

30
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:08,310
BUT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT
AMOUNT OF WASTE IN THE MILITARY

31
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,680
AND IT WAS SOMETHING TRUMP
CRITICIZING HE WAS CAMPAIGNING.

32
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,680
HE CLAIMED HE WAS GOING TO STOP
IT, BUT HE IS ONLY ADDING

33
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,310
TO THAT WASTE.

34
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,640
OF COURSE HE WANTS TO DO THAT
MILITARY PARADE WHICH WOULD

35
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,040
TAKE TAXPAYER MONEY.

36
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,059
THAT IS AN EXAMPLE OF WASTE.

37
00:02:25,059 --> 00:02:29,510
ESPECIALLY WHEN PEOPLE IN
CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT

38
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:33,060
HIMSELF KEEP MAKING ARGUMENTS
AGAINST UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE AND

39
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:42,829
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THE TOPIC
OF SOCIAL SECURITY COMES UP.

40
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,790
HOW ABOUT YOU DON'T SPEND AN
ADDITIONAL $700 BILLION ON THE

41
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,919
MILITARY WHICH IS INCREDIBLY
WASTEFUL.

42
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,209
WHY DO I THINK IT'S WASTEFUL?

43
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:54,049
A
LOT OF YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT

44
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:57,540
MANY GOES TO PRIVATE CONTRACTORS
WHEN IN REALITY WE DON'T NEED TO

45
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,970
PAY THESE EXORBITANT FEES TO
THESE CONTRACTORS TO GET THINGS

46
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,040
DONE IN THE PENTAGON.

47
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:15,949
JUST LAST DECEMBER, THE
WASHINGTON POST PUBLISHED AN

48
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:20,120
INCREDIBLE PIECE REGARDING THE
PENTAGON AND HOW THEY TRIED TO

49
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,969
COVER UP A STUDY THAT SHOWED
$125 BILLION IN WASTE.

50
00:03:25,969 --> 00:03:33,200
THIS STUDY, GO BACK AND READ IT.

51
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,840
THE STUDY IS DONE AND THE
DEFENSE DEPARTMENT COULD'VE

52
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,489
SAVED IT BY LOOKING AT THE
RESULTS AND DOING SOMETHING TO

53
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,889
CUT THE WASTE AND BUREAUCRACY.

54
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:47,809
THERE'S HONESTLY MONEY GOING TO
THINGS THAT WE DON'T NEED

55
00:03:47,809 --> 00:03:49,139
IN THE MILITARY ANYMORE.

56
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:53,579
INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THE
PENTAGON REALIZED IF THIS

57
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:58,469
BECOMES PUBLIC THEN CONGRESS IS
MUCH LESS LIKELY TO INCREASE

58
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:01,529
FUNDING TO THE DEFENSE
DEPARTMENT.

59
00:04:01,529 --> 00:04:03,969
LET'S JUST BURY IT AND PRETEND
LIKE IT DOESN'T EXIST.

60
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:10,150
IN THAT SAME PIECE, TRUMP IS
QUOTED AS SAYING HE'S GOING TO

61
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:16,959
STOP IT.

62
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,459
HE IS SUPPOSEDLY GOING TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

63
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:32,270
HE GETS TO OFFICE AND WHAT IS
THE CALL FOR?

64
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,270
ANYWAY IT IS JUST

65
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,900
FRUSTRATING.

66
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:42,680
WE PAY TAXES SO OUR GOVERNMENT
CAN TAKE CARE OF US.

67
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:49,389
WE GOT INTO THE DETAILS OF THE
IRAN DEAL YESTERDAY.

68
00:04:49,389 --> 00:05:00,580
THAT IS 
ALL BEING DONE ON

69
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,819
PURPOSE BECAUSE THEY WANT

70
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:04,780
MORE MONEY FOR THESE PRIVATE
CONTRACTORS AND THAT IS IT.

71
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:10,120
WHO CARES ABOUT YOUR SOCIAL
SECURITY, OR YOUR HEALTH

72
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,830
INSURANCE OR COVERAGE.

73
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,610
WHO CARES ABOUT AFFORDABLE
HOUSING AND MAKING SURE THE

74
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,680
PEOPLE IN OUR LIVING ON THE
STREET.

75
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,300
WE HAVE TO FROM THE MILITARY
BECAUSE THESE PRIVATE

76
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,650
CONTRACTORS HAVE TO MAKE MONEY.

77
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,910
THAT IS WHERE TAXPAYER MONEY
GOES TO.

78
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,910
ADDITIONALLY I WOULD ADD IF
YOU ARE NOT ñ IF YOU ARE TAKING

79
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,910
700 BILLION FROM THE AMERICAN
TAXPAYERS FOR THE MILITARY ñ I

80
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:23,910
SHOULD SAY IF THERE IS
SINGLE-PAYER HEALTH CARE,

81
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,910
THERE IS GOING TO BE WASTE.

82
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:25,910
THERE IS WASTE EVERYWHERE IN
GOVERNMENT.

83
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:26,910
BUT IT IS STILL BETTER.

84
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,910
BUT THE VA, THERE IS NO TALK
ABOUT THE VA HERE.

85
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,729
THIS IS A BLANKET BILL, IT IS
UNFETTERED AND UNTOUCHED BY

86
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:30,729
AMENDMENTS.

87
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:32,820
AMENDMENTS THEY COULD'VE TALKED
ABOUT NORTH KOREA.

88
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,310
THERE IS NOTHING IN HERE ABOUT
THE BAN ON TRANSGENDER IN

89
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,759
THE MILITARY.

90
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:43,500
THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE IS
GOING TO GET THIS AND TALK

91
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,879
ABOUT WHERE THE MONEY IS GOING
TO GO.

92
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:47,090
BUT THERE IS NO TALK ABOUT THE
VA.

93
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:54,000
THAT TO ME IS ONE THING THAT IS
BLARING.

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,860
THIS IS WHAT STICKS OUT TO ME
ñ NICK MULVANEY MONTHS AGO ñ

95
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:07,050
WHEN IT WENT DOWN TO THE MEALS
ON WHEELS IT WAS ONE OF THE

96
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,050
HEADLINES.

97
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,659
HE WAS READY TO CUT IT BECAUSE
NO ONE REALLY NEEDS THAT.

98
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:15,180
THERE WAS ONE LINE HE SAID WHERE
HE SAID I CAN'T FORCE A

99
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,099
CONSTRUCTION WORKER IN OHIO THAT
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS

100
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:23,999
SINGLE MOTHERS ENTITLEMENTS OR
HER CHILDREN'S EDUCATION, I

101
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:28,879
CAN'T MAKE HIM PAY TAXES TO GO
TO HER.

102
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:34,689
BUT I CAN MAKE EVERYONE WHO IS
DISAGREEING WITH THESE WARS TO

103
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:43,879
BUILD MORE WAR MACHINES OR BUILD
MORE COMPANIES.

104
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:47,969
WHAT IF I RAISE MY HAND AND SAID
I DON'T WANT TO FUND YOUR WARS

105
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:50,210
ANYMORE?

106
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,800
I DON'T HAVE THAT SAY
ANYMORE.

107
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,639
BUT THAT OHIO WORKER HAS ALL THE
RIGHT TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT, EFF

108
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:00,990
THE MOTHER IN KANSAS.

109
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:08,900
BY THE WAY
THIS IS A PERFECT ILLUSTRATION

110
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,280
WHERE WHILE THE GOVERNMENT TAKES
OUR TAXPAYER MONEY AND USES IT

111
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,870
TOWARD THIS TYPE OF WASTE, TO
MAKE PRIVATE CONTRACTORS WEALTHY

112
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,460
THEY DISTRACT US BY ATTACKING
THAT MOTHER LIVING IN POVERTY.

113
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,129
THEY DISTRACT US BY TALKING
ABOUT THE "OTHERS."

114
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:32,730
AND THE WALL AND THE MEXICANS.

115
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:41,610
THEY DISTRACT US ñ

116
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:46,210
DO YOU THINK THIS IS A TOPIC OF
DISCUSSION AMONGST MOST

117
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,360
AMERICANS?

118
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,669
HELL NO.

119
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:54,810
BUT THIS IS THE KIND OF STUFF
THAT REALLY GOES ON THAT

120
00:07:54,810 --> 00:00:00,000
AMERICANS SHOULD BE OUTRAGED
ABOUT.
