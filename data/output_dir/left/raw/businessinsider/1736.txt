1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,260
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> studies have been done on this</font>

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,429
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they come out in slightly different</font>

3
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:07,040
places but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in general trust respect</font>

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">patience it's ironic those are not</font>

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,070
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we necessarily think of as</font>

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,870
sexy traits but when you're talking

7
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,849
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> relationships</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> long-term</font>

8
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,710
relationships are usually based on the

9
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,570
fact that people turn towards each other

10
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,000
to help and support each other so trust

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">is an absolutely huge piece of that as</font>

12
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,650
is respect and researchers have done

13
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,599
studies and shown that they can tell

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,670
very quickly if they videotape couples

15
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">for five minutes and there's no respect</font>

16
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,969
or they belittle each other<font color="#CCCCCC"> through that</font>

17
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:34,590
relationship<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a very very high chance</font>

18
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,180
of collapsing so those are really

19
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,129
important traits and I think those are

20
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:39,870
important traits in long-term

21
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,070
relationships so in a long-term

22
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,200
relationship you want to have all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

23
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,219
those steady constant respect but you

24
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,200
also have to make sure that you keep in

25
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,760
your long-term relationship kind of that

26
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,890
spark<font color="#E5E5E5"> going as well and that's always</font>

27
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:00,000
the tricky part
