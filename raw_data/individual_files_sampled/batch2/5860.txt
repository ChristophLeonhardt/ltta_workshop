David thank you for being with us obviously we're thinking about you and everybody in your class David's sister lost several friends little sister how the hell were you and your sister doing we're doing as good as we could be at this point we just had to continue fighting to save every other child in America because these politicians won't and these lobbyists aren't gonna stop buying them no you know we it's so interesting that people called you a crisis actor early on and there is all this shock and outrage in the media how dare they desert and I just sat here thinking after what you've been through after what your sisters been through that's that's the sort of thing you probably just brush off right at this point it's just good advertising I mean it's bad press on their part but we still get attention the media they're doing a great job of it I quadrupled my Twitter following yeah none of it's true so well why so what what it what is the goal for not only you and and other people that went through this hell in their schools but and and how sustainable is it is this something that's going to be with us now but sort of this sort of fade away no this is going to continue this will be a generation long thing and this is just getting started Millennials of some are some of the most politically active and some of the most critical individuals I I've ever met in people that I've grown up around as I am one and as such I think that's really what's going to sustain this process realizing what's wrong with America and trying to fix it because the previous generation won't Mike David you and your sister both students at the school the school is slated to reopen at some point this week Tuesday or Wednesday I guess you can wash the blood from the floors you can patch up the holes and the doors you can't wash away those memories that's the issue how do you deal with it do you know yet I don't I really don't I don't personally I don't want to go back to school until our legislators at least in Florida passed one bill just one bill where either they raised the gun law the age that you can buy any gun in the state to 21 or they have a universal background check system in Florida for literally anything because at this point why should I have to work if my elected officials won't work to save my life and everybody around me and I want to point something out to you all the glass that's being replaced in our school isn't being replaced with bulletproof glass it's being replaced with the old glass that's a shooter shot through none of the locks are being replaced with locks that can be locked from the inside and I know that's going to cost a lot of money but if every school does it because of economies of scale the price will go down we just have to start that David condolences on your the losses of your family and friends have suffered here I want to ask you right now you were up against an organization that spends a half a billion dollars a year with an agenda that says that we should have more guns in the hands of more people to be more safe and so what's your message to that message and to that idea that the way to be more safe is to have more weapons in the hands of more people well I think to those people I would say that it's good to have your second Amendment rights it's good to believe that you can protect yourself and protect those around you but I want people to acknowledge the fact that we do have a major gun violence problem in this country when that's not going away and hasn't gone away and won't go away and so we have major reform and act and by reform I don't mean a way taking away people's guns people are always going to have their guns in always gonna have the Second Amendment because that's the argument that these kids are running around and people that support them want to confiscate guns want to kick down doors and take it's like this is it what you're talking about in the same way that there's limitations on the First Amendment right where you can't yell fire in a crowded theater you shouldn't be able to get an ar-15 or any weapon that couldn't kill a number of people if you're a mentally unstable individual if you're a person with a criminal background or somebody with a history of domestic violence I don't get what's so hard for these legislators to understand this is sensible gun control that both sides can support but they sadly can't because they're bought by the NRA Jim Vanda your activism has been very admirable how much are you hearing from people outside of Florida from other kids who want to get involved and when you talk about it becoming a generational thing how do you organize something like that is that underway are you in contact of people who can put that together it has to be as a grassroots movement that's what we're that's what we've created here we have had some support celebrities but mainly it's a grassroots movement by getting funding from everybody around here last night I was in Livingston New Jersey at her campaign rally because essentially that's what this has become sadly it shouldn't have to be but I was there giving a speech explaining my situation our agenda and everything like that and I was meeting amazing individuals and shaking hands with them and it was every single person that I met with there I knew that's how change was coming because those people showed up and because those people showed up they stood up and made their voice heard and we're gonna have to outlive the NRA and we will because they certainly are going to talk but neither away David are sorry you your family the community are you starting to hear a rising concern about how the Broward Sheriff's operated staying outside while the shooting was going on I'm glad you bring that up and it definitely is a raising concern that the fact that they didn't go in but that also brings up two things one how can we expect our teachers to step in and take action if trained security guards that are part of the Sheriff's Department wouldn't take action and two why are these elected officials trying to blame this on the bureaucracy they're in charge of them this is their fault they should have been regulating them I'm not gonna allow them to pressure these people because at the end of the day it's their fault these elected officials are the boss of these Sheriff personnel and just like the president is about the FBI right Governor Rick Scott is essentially the boss of Scott ezreal the sheriff and as such he should be held accountable you can't just blame this on the bureaucracy and expect to get reelected and III I think the that investigation is starting but it is it is shocking that you hear time again in these types of tragedies teachers and in this case a football coach stepping in front of bullets saving lives and by giving their lives while people that are paid by taxpayers in Broward County were staying outside hiding behind their cars exactly I want to point something out quick that that's that football coach coach fires he was a security guard and he was protecting those students he's one of the people that stepped in unlike those cowardly Broward County sheriff's officials honestly I probably support law enforcement and we always should without them I wouldn't be to speak here today none of us would we wouldn't be able to have a functioning democracy where everybody can practice their First Amendment right to freedom of speech sadly these are a few individuals that did not conduct their job correctly but I don't think it's right that Governor Rick Scott's trying to blame this on the bureaucracy in an effort to get reelected by the way so your AP History mm-hmm teacher Jeff Foster AP gov yeah ap gun watches the show yes he does thank you for watching yeah all right thank you thank you so much good luck Thank You Preston all right all right ahead in our 7 o'clock hour we're going to
