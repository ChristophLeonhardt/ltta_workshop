1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
today's try something new challenge was

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,360
to try some new food try something

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,589
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something different a</font>

4
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:06,060
restaurant or if you're a broke student

5
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,680
like me get something at the supermarket

6
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,990
now I'm vegetarian so that already

7
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">limits the options and I'm with students</font>

8
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,290
so that kind of limited be down to about

9
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,389
23 pounds it was originally<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

10
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:17,160
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vegetarian cafes that they have a</font>

11
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,050
few of<font color="#E5E5E5"> around here by then I realized</font>

12
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I've actually tried pretty much</font>

13
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,230
everything off the menu and the things I

14
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,580
hadn't tried I knew what they were and

15
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,930
I'd had elsewhere so I knew what they

16
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,939
tasted like so that's no fun at all my

17
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,070
last option was the international food

18
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,660
market because that's kind of a place

19
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,850
where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get slightly less conventional</font>

20
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,620
staff and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> supermarket's normally a</font>

21
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,239
bit crap for vegetarian stuff to be

22
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,770
honest so ended up in the Greek section

23
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,600
and with a lot of the Greek stuffed food

24
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,520
I have had Greek food before they have

25
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,410
had stuffed food before in Mexico we

26
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,879
stuff lots of peppers and I've had

27
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,410
stuffed vine leaves which I like a lot

28
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,789
but then I thought I'd pick a stuffed

29
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:49,020
vegetable where I don't really

30
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,940
traditionally enjoy the vegetable that

31
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,129
much I picked stuffed zucchini I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

32
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:55,079
really love cadets I really loved them a

33
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,930
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> but and my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mum made great soup from</font>

34
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,670
it and I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to love really eating them</font>

35
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,320
the for some reason as i got older i

36
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,760
became very aware of the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

37
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,769
they're quite like slimy of something

38
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,360
about like their texture that I didn't

39
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,159
like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of stopped eating them all</font>

40
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,780
but stopped eating them so this could be

41
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">fun or this could be torture either way</font>

42
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,900
I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a little bit like I'm a</font>

43
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,400

45
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:17,790
