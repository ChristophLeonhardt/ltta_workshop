I'll come here today to talk about how I
feel and I feel like that we are treated
differently than other people I don't
like how we're treated and just because
of Akko it doesn't mean anything to me
we have black people and we shout to
feel like this we should have to protest
because y'all are treating us wrong we
do this because we need to have right
I'm in born and raised in Charlotte you
know never felt this way to now then I
guess that our fathers and mothers are
guilt and we can receive them anymore
it's a shame that we have to go to that
graveyard
hey Barry view and we have this we
shouldn't have tears
we need our fathers and mothers to be by
our side
