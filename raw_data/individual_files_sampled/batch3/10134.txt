cooperation we have between Russia and Italy thank you for your attention so the varible toliet oh yes Eric we in ocasion e di questa mi prima vicita an elevator Presidente L considered a minute

re like operaciones a very campy cultural economical Charlie so Charlotte our cooperation in various areas including the economy cultural exchange we have discussed them during my meeting with President Putin and it was a very fruitful and helpful meeting we've noted that a good tradition that we have in our bilateral relations and we worked on the future prospects for the for our for these relations as for international relations we are faced with numerous challenges to the security and prospects of development for Europe and I think it's important to discuss those issues with a strategic partner such as Russia Russia would be instrumental to find a response to international global crisis and I believe that those solutions must be sustainable in constructive I believe in Moscow's constructive approach and attitudes and together with President Putin we discussed Libya like he has already said in the task of strengthening institutions for social and economic development in Libya and this can only be ensured them through an inclusive dialogue and reconciliation which must be overseen by the United Nations but driven by the Libyan people themselves and it's necessary that the international community should demonstrate unity and solidarity in supporting the United Nations on this path Italy has planned a conference on Libya in Palermo on November the 12th and 13th inviting all the Libyan stakeholders and our main partners in the Middle East and North Africa and also stakeholders from around the world Russia's participation would also be necessary to ensure a step forward in stabilizing Libya and I've shared this point of view with President Putin and I've seen total support from him on this issue so Moscow will contributes to this conference as well we've also exchanged opinions regarding Syria and we support the Geneva process and the activities of the United Nations in stabilizing and achieving reconciliation in Libya and we believe that that this also requires a sustainable inclusive solution with participation from all the main actors in the region and the world where Russia plays at one of the key roles we highly value and appreciate Moscow's role in achieving the militarization indeed live promised which province which has enabled us to avoid a human Syrian and military catastrophe in this area and we also hope that Russia will participate in finding a long-term solution for for Syria we also discussed the crisis in Ukraine which remains an important challenge for Europe but it has put Russia's relationship wit with the european union in question and unless we resolve this issue we risk losing the heritage of mutual confidence and cooperation that the European Union and Russia had developed over two decades and both Russia and Europe requires security and the security arrangements shared by all its actors and stakeholders there's no alternative to the implementation of the Minsk agreements of Italy fully supports the OSE efforts where Italy is now at co-president and the Normandy four format as for each of these bilateral relations with Russia President Putin has already enumerated a number of areas and here we've also reconfirmed the great level of our bilateral relations despite the fact that the situation which has been the reason for the sanctions from the EU is lingering is still there and despite that I believe it is necessary to support and maintain the relationship between easly in Italy in Russia including the presence of Italian companies in the Russian markets to the benefit of both our countries and I've said on numerous occasions and I would like to re-emphasize that sanctions are never a purpose for Italy they are only a tool which should be left behind as soon as possible and we should resort to dialogue which we will benefit from we should not be afraid of globalization but we should have availed ourselves of the great opportunities offered by globalization Russia is the world's largest fifth largest markets outside the EU for Italian products there are a lot of Italian companies working in Russia both from the big business and the Assamese back in 2017 Italian exports to Russia resume gross finally and in the first quarters of the this year this trend has continued and so we believe that Italian experts to Russia can further increase Italian companies show growing interest toward the Russian market and we are ready to strengthen industrial cooperation which has been manifested in the signing of the numerous agreements between Russian and Chilean companies which you were just witnessed and where which we participated in with President Putin with great inspiration we also have great relations and cooperation in the area of culture in science the demand for learning Italian in Russia is great there were over 50 language schools in Russia which teach Italian there is cooperation in various formats in the area of science especially in the area physics and medicine between Russia and Italy and I very much hope for this kind of cooperation to continue to expand thank you now we will proceed to the Q&A we have two questions for both Italian and Russian journalists I would like to ask two questions first is to mr. Compton since you believe that Russia is going to return to the g7 or rather this should once again be called a g8 we can see good relations and excellent relations between Russia and Italy how far is your government ready to go to go against the idea of imposing sanctions on Russia from the EU are going to impose a veto on the sanctions and the question to mr. Putin taking into account that Russia is all already considered to be a key actor in terms of resolving global crisis as I understand you have received a personal invitation to the Libya conference in Palermo and what's the vision of Moscow in terms of the Libyan crisis first I will respond to your query it is obvious that the crisis in Ukraine like I said is an issue that has caused a fracture in the relationship between Russia and Europe and has managed to block the dialogue to suspend the dialogue that Russian Europe had been building up for 20 years we need to overcome this and it's been going on to lot for too long this this crisis in relations already Italy believes that a promising fruitful way forward would be to convince all European partners to go within the framework of a single direction of a single opinion them we don't want to take any decisions right now we intend to take them in the future easily first would like to convince all of our partners that dialogue is the best way of solving a problem thank you for the first part of your question my gratitude I'd like to give a lengthy answer to the detailed and sort of a second question as I've said we support Italy's efforts to resolve the Libyan crisis as it is well known it is a man-made crisis not made by Russia by the way certainly we support all that Italy does in this area as I said I'm going to repeat myself here I think that our approach completely aligned with Italy's approach in the sense that Altima try all the domestic Libyan issues need to be resolved by the Libyan people themselves we as guarantors can only support them and that and we wish them good luck in organizing the Palermo conference I'm still not sure if I'll be able to personally be present there but I can assure you that Russia will be present on the highest level there I have the question about the INF treaty this issue has been discussed both in Russia in the US and in Europe as well because of the nature of these arms the intermediate-range arms my colleague has said yesterday Europe can become hostages of the US if the US withdrawal from this treaty it's not yet clear whether it's going to withdrawals but whatever happens if Trump and his administration go from words to actions are you ready to response what is going to be Russia's response to that thank you the problem has existed for quite some time it's not just that the US president has announced his withdrawal the problem has existed far before that and if you have noticed the US Congress has already actually counted the expenses for the development of intermediate-range missiles it means that they have decided that beforehand because if they want to develop missiles like that it means that they were going to make this stamp the budget is rady agreed upon in the Congress in the US Congress so the political statement we've heard several days ago raises some questions we have some questions some issues regarding missiles and some of the agreements reached by the US and Russia and previously the Soviet Union what we are worried about is that the the missile defense system treaty has been basically eliminated now we're talking about the immediate nuclear forces treaty we don't know what's going to happen about the new start don't know what's going to happen with the new start if it's eliminated nothing will remain in the area of arms control if that happens we will face a very worrisome situation very worrying situation as for Europe well the main issue if the u.s. withdraws from the INF treaty what are they going to do with the new missiles if they are delivered to Europe well if they deliver them to Europe and place them there we will have just to make a mirroring response a similar response so if they do this they must realize that they their territory is going to be under threat of an equal well counter action Counter Strike so I'm not sure if there needs to be for this kind of escalation in Europe I see no reason for that but this is not our choice but not theirs not something we wish for so to answer directly to your question yes we will answer we have a response and this will be Swift and effective now what can be the formal reason for our us partners to withdraw from the INF they will say that we are somehow violating the treaty but they have no nothing to back their claims but the US has already violated the treaty for example in Romania when they placed their own AG's systems there these systems can be used to launch attack missiles all they need to do is change the software in the systems this will take this is a matter of hours we won't even be able to see this so they have violated the treaty in that themselves or take for example drones attack drones this is also a direct violation they are no different from intermediate-range missiles so we are analyzing everything that's happening we are still ready to work with our American partners but it is important to see what happens next what decisions are taken after that and we hope that all of these issues will be resolved for example on the level on the 11th of November in Paris I would like to add that easily also is concerned regarding this issue because we're speaking of missiles of intermediate-range missiles and the fact that this treaty can be abandoned is of importance to us and I've told the President Putin that I was very young when we had pershing rockets stationed and I would like I would not like to go back to that era I hope that we will be able to overcome the situation and I will tell President Trump over the phone that Italy as always will try to do everything in its capacity to preserve or contribute to preserving a window for dialogue regarding this process we should focus on areas of cooperation and try to avoid an escalation what I say Mattia Paoli from ansa news agency president Putin's would you feel positive about if there was an opportunity for Russia to by Italy's government issued bonds and a question to the Italian prime minister if Russia decided to invest in our government issued the obligate bonds do you think Washington and Brussels would look favorably at this that they wouldn't mind and would that help us in improving the climate of trust and confidence and avoiding a flight of capital from Italy we know what's happening between Italy and the euro Commission differences they are deciding which way is more effective to economic growth and make economy more effective this is something that's been happening for a long time not just between Italy and the European Commission this has been discussed for a long time between the experts what's more effective which ways would be more effective how to use the presentation but this is not our business strictly speaking with I don't even want to say anything about that but we know about these difficult issues we know about the debt pressure we know about that I believe that Italy's economy as a strongly foundation and we trust what Italy's government is doing on the whole we are positive that these issues are going to be resolved one way or another and from our political standpoint we're not going to somehow limit the work of our National Welfare Fund we are going to find new ways to restore the resources its restored right very quickly about seven about seven billion dollars a month I'm not talking about the gold reserves of the central bank which is about four hundred and sixty billion dollars right now this is an issue to be resolved by the economic actors we are not going to introduce any political limitations as for the effect to be expected when we see trusts to those who emit government bonds issue bonds this is always good and we haven't discussed this today we haven't posed such issues on the agenda today respondent key I would also like to respond to this question obviously this issue concerns me as well I would like to to be very clear I didn't come to Russia to ask President Putin to buy Italian bonds the Italian economy is solid and it is recognized in the world why worldwide outside it easily but it's not always acknowledged the inside easily and if Russian central bank or the fund for national well-being if they decide to buy Italian bonds it's because they believe it believe it to be a good bargain not because we asked them about it thank you Interfax news agency since energy was discussed during your meeting could you tell us whether you discuss the issue of implementing the Nord Stream 2 project with regard to the controversy in Europe but visibly this project and also could you take us what steps could be taken for Italy to receive Russian gas via the Black Sea and whether it could contribute or participate in the projects for developing the gas transportation network for southern Europe anything is possible in this area we see an increase in the deliveries so for our carbons to Europe we are also doing a lot for alternative energy Italian companies for example are helping us build windmills wind power stations and we are creating smart electric grids as for the specifically issues of infrastructure infrastructure development we are looking at all of the possibilities we are looking at adding Italy to the Turkish stream which could be done through Bulgaria Bulgaria and Serbia and Hungary this could also be done through Greece we have this cooperation because there's going to be more deliveries through the Nord Stream pipeline although we haven't discussed it specifically and I'd like to inform you and remind you that the system that comes from Baumgarten that will pass through the North Remus two pipeline this infrastructure pipeline is a joint Russian Italian company and in this respect Italy needs to be should be interested in implement in the implementation of the Nord Stream 2 project but still we are looking at all of the possibilities these projects are not aimed against the interests of this that third party they are not aimed against for example Ukraine the aim the only aim is to help Europe with its demand for hydrocarbons we see the growth in this demand every year this is obvious this year gas prom will deliver a record amount of energy resources to our European partners so this is all coming very naturally and we have discussed this in general strokes thank you
