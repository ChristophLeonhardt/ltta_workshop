Tucker: TWO WEEKS AGO ONE PERSON ACCUSED BRETT KAVANAUGH OF ACCUSING A SEX CRIME IN 1982. FOUR OTHER PEOPLE PRESENT DENY IT HAPPENED. THOSE ARE THE FACTS WE HAVE ON THE TABLE. FOR THIS, THE LEFT HAS CALLED HIM A SEX CRIMINAL AND AN ATTEMPTED RAPIST AND TRIED TO DESTROY HIS LIFE. HE FOUGHT BACK YESTERDAY. NOW HIS PERSECUTORS HAVE A NEW ARGUMENT. WATCH. WE KNOW ONE THING, HE DOES NOT HAVE THE TEMPERAMENT TO BE A JUDGE. HE BASICALLY HAD A TANTRUM AND SHOWED THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE THE TEMPERAMENT TO BE A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. FELT LIKE OH, THAT IS WHAT HE IS LIKE WHEN HE IS ANGRY AND BELLIGERENT WHEN HE IS DRUNK. HIS TEMPERAMENT IS NOT SUITED. MY OPPOSITION SOLIDIFIED BECAUSE OF TEMPERAMENT AND FITNESS, WHICH I BELIEVE HE LACKS. Tucker: SENATOR BLUMENTHAL DELIVERING HIS VERDICT HERE. CHRIS HAHN AN ATTORNEY AND RADIO HOST AND FORMER AIDE TO SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER AND HE JOINS US TONIGHT. THIS IS THE MOST OR WELLIAN ARGUMENT I HAVE SEEN. YOU ATTACK A GUY, AN ATTEMPTED RAPIST AND A DRUNK, SOMEONE UNFIT. NOT JUST TO BE A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE BUT TO LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY. WHEN HE GETS MAD ABOUT IT AND HE DEFENDS HIMSELF, YOU SAY LOOK AT HIM. HE IS AN ABUSER BECAUSE HE GOT MAD. WHAT? THAT IS TOO UNFAIR, ACTUALLY. WELL, WHEN YOU ARE WEAK ON THE LAW, WEAK ON THE FACTS, POUND THE LAW. IF YOU ARE WALK ON THE LAW, POUND THE FACTS. IF YOU ARE WEAK ON BOTH, YOU POUND THE TABLE. IT WAS A DISAPPOINTING DISPLAY BY JUDGE KAVANAUGH, JUDGE WOULD ACCEPT. I WORKED IN THE FEDERAL COURTS AND I WORKED IN THE STATE COURTS. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THAT IS NOT SOMETHING YOU ACCEPT FROM A LEVEL-HEADED JURIST. Tucker: OKAY. BUT THE LEVEL-HEADED JURIST WAS JUST ACCUSED OF A SEX CRIME. HE SAYS HE DIDN'T COMMIT. HIS REPUTATION HAS BEEN DESTROYED. HE WILL NEVER WORK AGAIN UNLESS HE GETS THIS JOB. YOU KNOW THAT TO BE TRUE. IF I SAID HEY, CHRIS NO, THIS IS A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT. Tucker: IF SOMEONE SAID ANONYMOUSLY THAT YOU ARE A RAPIST. I WILL TELL YOUR KIDS ABOUT IT AND THEY WON'T SPEAK TO YOU AND YOUR NEIGHBORS WON'T SPEAK TO IT. THIS HAPPENED TO ME. I WAS UPSET. IS IT OKAY BECAUSE IT'S LEGITIMATE TO BE UPSET. I WOULD NOT BE BEHAVING LIKE A SUPREME COURT JUDICIAL NOMINEE. HE IS A SUPREME COURT JUDICIAL NOMINEE. WHO SHOULD ALWAYS PRESENT HIMSELF AS Tucker: HOW SHOULD SENATORS BEHAVE? ESPECIALLY THE MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE? SHOULD THEY BE HONEST AND FAIR? TRYING TO DESTROY HIM? DO WHATEVER THE VOTERS ACCEPT. SENATORS STAND BEFORE THE VOTERS AND ARE APPROVED BY THE VOTERS. THIS MAN STANDS BEFORE CONGRESS. Tucker: HOWEVER VOTERS WILL ACCEPT? HE IS GOING FOR A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT, SIR. A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT. TUCKER, C'MON. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HIGHER STANDARD. Tucker: THAT WAS THE MOST REVEALING ANSWER I GOT. IT'S FRIDAY. AT THE END OF THE SHOW WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. Tucker: TOOK THIS LONG TO GET A CLEAR ANSWER. BEHAVE HOWEVER THE VOTERS WANT. YOU ALWAYS WANT A CLEAR ANSWER. Tucker: I'LL THINK ABOUT IT ALL WEEKEND. ALMOST OUT OF TIME. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, DONALD TRUMP SAID SPECIFICALLY THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBT. HOW COULD WE HAVE NO DOUBT AFTER YESTERDAY? SORRY, THERE IS PLENTY OF DOUBT OF KAVANAUGH'S STORY. ABSOLUTELY. Tucker: I'M NOT A PARTISAN REPUBLICANS. I DON'T LIKE THE REPUBLICANS MUCH. I WATCHED THEM YESTERDAY AND I FELT FOR HIM. I TURN ON THE OTHER CHANNELS AND THAT ARE LIKE "WHITE PRIVILEGE!" WE DON'T SEE THE WORLD THE SAME WAY AT ALL. THE QUESTION, THE QUESTION DID YOU BELIEVE HER? Tucker: I BELIEVED HER. I THINK SHE THINKS SHE IS TELLING THE TRUTH. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE SHE IS TELLING THE TRUTH BUT I BELIEVE SHE BELIEVES IT. IT DOESN'T MAKE IT TRUE. THERE IS AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION. I FEEL SORRY FOR HER. OUT OF TIME. CHRIS, THANK YOU. MOST PEOPLE RELIVING A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE DON'T HAVE EVIDENCE OF IT 30 YEARS LATER.
