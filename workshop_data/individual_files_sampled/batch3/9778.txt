Shepard: 23 MINUTES BEFORE THE HOUR, "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" IS REPORTING, AND BY THE WAY "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"'S PARENT COMPANY ON THE FOX NEWS COMPANY PARENT COMPANY SHARE OWNERSHIP. THE PRESIDENT LED AN EFFORT TO SILENCE STORMY DANIELS, AND SAID HE WOULD PAY ALL THE LEGAL COSTS INVOLVED. ACCORDING TO THE REPORTING OF "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" BACK IN FEBRUARY, PRESIDENT TRUMP ORDERED HIS THEN LAWYER AND PERSONAL FIXER MICHAEL COHEN TO GET A RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST STORMY DANIELS WITH HELP FROM THE PRESIDENT'S SON, ERIC TRUMP. THE JOURNAL REPORTS ERIC TRUMP THEN GOT A TRUMP ORGANIZATION LAWYER TO HELP WITH ALL THE PAPERWORK. THE GOAL HERE, PREVENT STORMY DANIELS FROM IGNORING A NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT FROM OCTOBER OF 2016, AND TO PREVENT HER FROM TALKING ABOUT HER CLAIM THAT SHE HAD WITH TRUMP A DECADE BEFORE THAT, LONG BEFORE HE BECAME PRESIDENT, BUT NOT LONG AFTER HIS WIFE MILANI I BIRTH TO THEIR SON. NONE OF IT WORKED. STORMY DANIELS DID GO PUBLIC AS WE ALL KNOW AND DID AN INTERVIEW WITH 60 MINUTES ON CBS. MORE THAN 20 MILLION PEOPLE WATCHED. UNTOLD NUMBERS HAVE SEEN IT SINCE ONLINE. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DENIED THAT HE HAD WITH THAT PERSON, BUT HE ADMITS REIMBURSING COHEN FOR THE $130,000 THAT DANIELS RECEIVED BEFORE THE ELECTION TO KEEP QUIET. MICHAEL: PLEADED GUILTY IN AUGUST TO VIOLATING CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAW AND COULD SPEND YEARS IN PRISON. HE SAID THAT TRUMP DIRECTED HIM, TO ARRANGE THE PAYMENT TODAY ANT THAT DONALD TRUMP DIRECTED HIM TO ARRANGE THE PAYMENT TODAY ANO DANIELS. PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LAWYER, RUDY GIULIANI, AS OF THAT MICHAEL COHEN IS NOT CREDIBLE AND THAT NONE OF THE CHARGES INVOLVED WRONGDOING BY THE PRESIDENT. MOST OF THIS WE ALREADY KNEW, BUT "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" REPORTS IS A FIRST TIME THAT WE'VE HEARD THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HIMSELF WAS INVOLVED IN TRYING TO SILENCE DANIELS, MUCH LESS THAT HE LED THE WHOLE THING. LET'S TURN TO MICHAEL ROTH FIELD, AN INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER WITH "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" AND COWROTE TODAY'S PIECE. NICE TO HAVE YOU. SO HE LED THAT. HOW DID YOU COME TO THAT THROUGH YOUR REPORTING? Michael: JUST TALKING TO SOURCES ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. WE INITIALLY REPORTED THAT A TRUMP ORGANIZATION LAWYER WAS INVOLVED IN THIS CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION PROCEEDING THAT WAS BACK IN MARCH, A MONTH AFTER THAT HAPPENED, AND CONTINUING REPORTING, WE LEARNED THAT IN FACT THERE WERE TWO PHONE CALLS THAT LED TO THAT WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND MICHAEL COHEN. ONE IN MID-FEBRUARY, FIRST WITH THE PRESIDENT TOLD MICHAEL COHEN, THEN HIS LAWYER, TO COORDINATE WITH ERIC TRUMP, AND HIS SON, AND WITH LAWRENCE ROSEN, AN OUTSIDE LAWYER. THEN A SECOND ONE A FEW DAYS LATER IN ROSEN'S OFFICE. TRUMP TOLD COHEN, I'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING, MEANING THE BILLS, AND JUST HANDLE THIS AND MAKE SURE SHE DOESN'T GO ON TELEVISION. Shepard: YOU SAID COORDINATE WITH THEM. COORDINATE WITH THEM IN THE EFFORT TO MAKE SURE SHE HOLDS UP HER END OF THE BARGAIN? Michael: AND THAT SHE DOESN'T TALK OR DO THIS IN AN ARBITRATION HEARING BECAUSE IT WOULD BE LIKE DISPUTE RESOLUTION IN THE CONTRACT THAT YOU HAVE, YOU GO SECRETLY INTO ARBITRATION AND TRY TO GET A DECISION. BUT AS YOU NOTED, STORMY DANIELS NOTED IGNORED THAT INJUNCTION THAT THEY ATTAINED. Shepard: PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DENIALS ON EVERY LEVEL OF THIS HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS AND THOROUGH, HAVE THEY NOT? Michael: THAT'S RIGHT. AT THE BEGINNING, AFTER WE REPORTED THE EXISTENCE OF THIS HUSH AGREEMENT, THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION, EVEN MICHAEL COHEN, DISTANCE THE PRESIDENT FROM THIS AND SAID BASICALLY, THIS WAS MICHAEL COHEN WHO DID THIS, YOU HAVE TO TALK TO MICHAEL COHEN. THE PRESIDENT DENIES EVERYTHING BUT IN FACT WE KNOW HE WAS INTIMATELY INVOLVED. Shepard: VIEWERS MAY HAVE A MEMORY BECAUSE SOMETIMES INFORMATION WILL TRIGGER A MEMORY ON SUCH THINGS. REMEMBER THE PRESIDENT WAS ON AIR FORCE ONE AND HE CAME BACK TO WHERE THE PRESS WAS. THE PRESS ASKED HIM ABOUT IT AND HE SAID, YOU WILL HAVE TO ASK MY LAWYER ABOUT THAT. VEITH FIVE RIGHT, HE ACTED LIKE HE NEVER KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. Shepard: THE IMPORTANCE OF WHO LED THIS, IT REALLY CAN'T BE OVERSTATED BECAUSE OF THE BIGGER INVESTIGATION INVOLVED. Michael: THAT'S RIGHT. MICHAEL: PLEADED GUILTY IN SETTING COURT THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD DIRECTED HIM TO MAKE THIS DEAL ON THE FIRST PLACE AND ALSO COORDINATE ON KAREN McDOUGALL, A "PLAYBOY" MODEL THAT HAD BEEN PAID BY THE "NATIONAL ENQUIRER" BEFORE THE ELECTIONS. THAT MAY STILL PLAY OUT IN OTHER INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE ONGOING. Shepard: THE PRESIDENT FURTHER MADE THE ARGUMENT THAT KEEPING THINGS QUIET ABOUT MATTERS OF THIS NATURE WAS DONE FOR THE REASON OF PROTECTING HIS FAMILY. NOT TO HURT HIS CHILD AND HIS WIFE AND OTHER MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY. THE BIGGER QUESTION IS, WHETHER THIS WOULD BE TANTAMOUNT TO, OR IF NOT DIRECTLY, OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE IN THE FACE OF THE INVESTIGATION. Michael: WE HAVEN'T HEARD THAT. Shepard: THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING, THAT WOULD BE THE OPEN QUESTION. Michael: RIGHT, I DON'T KNOW. Shepard: NOR DO WE. THE REASON THE PRESIDENT SAID THEY KEPT SUCH THINGS QUIET WAS BECAUSE OF HIS FAMILY. THIS COULD VERY WELL BE A PIVOTAL MATTER IF YOU ARE A MAN WHO IS DOING THIS INVESTIGATION. AND ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT WE NOW KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT DIRECTED ALL OF THIS, IS THERE ANYTHING NEW ABOUT THIS AFFAIR FROM BEGINNING TO END? Michael: WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED LESS ON WHILE YOU SAY AFFAIR, YOU DON'T MEAN THE AFFAIR. Shepard: I MEAN THE AFFAIR AS A WHOLE WAS AS INVESTIGATED ON. Michael: WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S INVOLVEMENT THROUGH COHEN'S GUILTY PLEA AND LEARNING THAT HE WAS MORE INVOLVED FROM BEGINNING TO END IN ALL OF THIS. WE HEARD A COUPLE MONTHS AGO, A TAPE OF TRUMP TALKING TO MICHAEL COHEN ABOUT THE KAREN McDOUGALL PAYMENT DURING THE CAMPAIGN AND POTENTIALLY BUYING THE RIGHTS TO THAT. WE LEARN FROM COHEN IN COURT THAT TRUMP WAS INVOLVED IN BOTH STORMY DANIELS AND KAREN McDOUGALL PAYMENTS AND NOW WE ARE FINDING OUT THAT AFTER THE ELECTION OR AFTER WE REVEALED AT THAT TRUMP WAS CONTINUING TO TRY
