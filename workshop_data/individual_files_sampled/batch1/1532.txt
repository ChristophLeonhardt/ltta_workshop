confirmation hearing day is at hand for the CIA director Michael Pompeo on tap to become the next US Secretary of State some say if confirmed Pompeyo eagerly will embrace president donald trump's america first approach to foreign policy he's a kind of guy that approaches the world thinking about how to use force and how to use coercion before he thinks about how to use diplomacy and that's you know this is just secretary of state is america's first diplomat so it's concerning to me as CIA director Pompeyo has been skeptical that negotiations will lead North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program even as Trump prepares for a key meeting with kim jeong-hoon in the coming weeks during his time as a congressman Pompeo called the Iran nuclear deal terrible and wants the u.s. to walk away from it and he has long accused Muslims and Arabs of being security threats a belief activists say disqualifies Pompeo from serving as the country's lead diplomat if confirmed as our next Secretary of State mr. Pompeo would infuse u.s. foreign policy with his view that Muslims are a monolith against which America must fight but others say Pompeius views won't matter to Middle East leaders who are more concerned in getting weapons and political legitimacy from Washington but could be problematic for Pompeo is his willingness to attack Moscow's behavior in Syria in Ukraine and in cyberspace something Donald Trump has up until recent days been reluctant to do here's what Pompeo said last month about Vladimir Putin he continues to view the greatest the greatest failure of the last centuries have been the dissolution of the Soviet Union he is bent on returning the former Soviet Union to its greatness and glory but Jon Glaser of the Cato Institute says Pompeo knows how to stay in his bosses good graces he knows how to talk in a way that doesn't offend Trump and he knows how to bolster Trump's sort of attitude and confidence it's unlikely the US Senate will reject Pompey's nomination ultimately it's worth recalling that he will be advancing Donald Trump's view of the world not his own Russell and Jordan al Jazeera Washington
