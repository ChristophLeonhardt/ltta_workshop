some folks have been getting random sex toys sent to them and they're frustrated because I can't find out who it's from what's the right way to approach this this is what a sex toy I did that that's my fault I was gonna have this whole thing where it landed where I was like they will they open the box and it was that but I forgot it I asked it's allowed sample means called sex toys now for those of you who don't know we have a visual today we just covered the whole like Shawn white thing I'd pop trigger today where he was making people look at stuff but I've gone through a lot of FCC FCC things where they're like you can show that but if there's veins you can't show it anyways people forgetting this it's a crazy story that takes a lot of twists and turns there's a person named Nicki it was reported she opened her box and it was a sex toy and then she kept getting more like parts for it and they mail didn't order it she did not order it at all she did a little research and she says I looked the sex toy up and it's $25 which is sort of substantial you know but for a sex do we know the ones we show we're not gonna show it yeah for a free gift yeah whatever it is what would you do yeah I have done so it's a little bit different fan sent me a sex toy at the young turks p.o box and i would i did not like it cuz i was it it was invasive it was like why would you assume this is something i would want from you or this is our what our relationship is it isn't and i was fuming about it and then an unnamed employee said yeah that's terrible can I have that and I gave it to them and it's just I can understand how Niki from this article might feel which is who is sending me this who has this intention is he near me does he know where I live yeah she tried to contact Amazon and she got the runaround a bunch of different times she said it was the same cycle where she'd get one person then kicking it to someone else they'd say sorry there's nothing we can do because we have to protect the privacy of the people who make purchases and we can't tell you who it is you know like she had on a wish list right she did not and so it's more widespread than she thought she said a student according to a report a student at Canada's Ryerson University received a vibrator a Student Union at University of Regina received a male sex toy called a fleshlight which so Regina received a vagina and an Amazon source said the sex toys for some reason have made a sizable portion of packages now how is this happening there is one theory that it's actually the sex toy companies themselves the vendors who are buying these and just sending them to random people whose addresses that they get nice scrape is it being fulfilled by Amazon though or is it being fulfilled by them it's I don't know for a fact she seems to think it's coming from Amazon mmm-hmm she thinks it's coming from someone within Amazon they according to this one theory Amazon uses a review system that heavily weights verified purchases reviews by users who have purchased a specific product through Amazon / other reviews this could give sellers incentives to buy and ship their own products to strangers from dummy accounts those dummy accounts could give the product a five-star review and then in turn help its surface higher in Amazon and Google searches they say that's not the case but well yeah what do you think what was what was your take on all this I think someone must have bought some contacts including her address that is the least unsettling theory I could put up with right as opposed to a stranger knows where she lives and is sending her sex toys I don't know why it's weird because there's a lot of privacy issues boiled up in this where you could be saying you know if I send someone something and just because they didn't want it or something well for some reason it's the impetus here that she gets it she goes this is great and she goes on Amazon and reviews it ya know there's no I don't know I've done a video about Amazon reviews of vibrators they're amazing if you become a member of the Young Turks you'll be saying you know I'm like a smart person so do it right now ey tea network.com slash join get the whole young turks show every day
