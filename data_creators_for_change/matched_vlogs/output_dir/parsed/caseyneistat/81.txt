when you take this we're taking this
into the city up on the Hubble diving
stuff attractions Campbell Road comical
shoes if you can pick it up anywhere
number one it says hop on hop off to it
then you can get that's what we can get
on this but what about where you want to
go exactly it's upside down
we are the worst tour is not the yellow
do this the red one for the decision
they're due
just hang this straight road you know it
really chaps my about the whole losing
my drone thing they're so hard to
replace the one one store that Dan found
that sells drones here in Dublin only
takes cash like a drug dealer in 1980s
who only takes cash for like an eleven
hundred dollar piece of electronic if
are we gonna sell your broken Jack T it
is my fault for losing the drone
I do feel naked without a drone though
aerial cinematography is such a key part
of well
we're here I'm here dan and I are here
in Dublin because I'm because I'm
attending the Dublin tech summit which
is this afternoon but why I'm only here
for like a day and while I was in
Montreal for like two hours and and
Chicago for like three hours tomorrow
we'll be in Belgium for half a day I
used to always accept the invitation
accept the opportunity to go to these
awesome events so it was a great way to
see the world and go to these events but
like in the last year between family and
work and everything else it makes it
hard to like use this as an excuse to
spend a week in Ireland or use it as an
excuse to spend a few days in Montreal
or Chicago so it's just these like quick
turns
I definitely miss taking time to like
embrace these new cities but in the same
respect you know priorities shift and
now my priority is being home
Casey did bad idea bad idea
working on this Daily Show for the last
15 days I've come up with a rhyme to
help me understand how to achieve on how
to achieve what we set out for every day
so if if the story b-roll and pretty
images take a backseat b-roll and pretty
in be role and pretty images take a
backseat when the story or narrative is
incomplete did you tell them your phone
