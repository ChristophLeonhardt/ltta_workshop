1
00:00:01,727 --> 00:00:04,764
WITH YOU FOR THAT BREAKING NEWS.

2
00:00:04,764 --> 00:00:07,400
MEANWHILE, THIS IS HAPPENING.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,569
PRESIDENT TRUMP FIRING BACK AT

4
00:00:09,569 --> 00:00:10,803
DEMOCRATS OVER THE LATEST

5
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:11,437
ACCUSATIONS AGAINST JUDGE

6
00:00:11,437 --> 00:00:13,039
KAVANAUGH, SAYING THEY ARE

7
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:15,008
PLAYING A "CON GAME."

8
00:00:15,008 --> 00:00:16,576
THE SUPREME COURT NOMINEE VOWED

9
00:00:16,576 --> 00:00:17,310
TO FIGHT THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST

10
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,013
HIM AHEAD OF A HEARING THIS

11
00:00:20,013 --> 00:00:20,380
THURSDAY.

12
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,180
HERE'S THE PRESIDENT JUST A FEW

13
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,017
MINUTES AGO.

14
00:00:24,017 --> 00:00:25,084
>> IT'S HORRIBLE WITH THE

15
00:00:25,084 --> 00:00:27,653
DEMOCRATS HAVE DONE, IT'S A CON

16
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,522
GAME, THEY ARE CON ARTISTS.

17
00:00:29,522 --> 00:00:32,558
THEY ARE TRYING TO CONVINCE --

18
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:33,126
THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT

19
00:00:33,126 --> 00:00:34,560
THEMSELVES.

20
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,963
THEY KNOW HE'S A HIGH-QUALITY

21
00:00:36,963 --> 00:00:38,898
PERSON, THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT.

22
00:00:38,898 --> 00:00:41,801
IT'S JUST RESISTANT ABSTRACT.

23
00:00:41,801 --> 00:00:43,269
>> Harris: THOSE REMARKS WERE

24
00:00:43,269 --> 00:00:43,870
FROM THE UNITED NATIONS

25
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,973
GENERAL ASSEMBLY RIGHT HERE IN

26
00:00:46,973 --> 00:00:48,675
NEW YORK, HE WAS SEATED NEXT TO

27
00:00:48,675 --> 00:00:50,009
THE PRESIDENT OF COLUMBIA AS

28
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:51,578
REPORTERS WERE ASKING HIM

29
00:00:51,578 --> 00:00:51,945
QUESTIONS.

30
00:00:51,945 --> 00:00:54,047
THEY COME AFTER SARAH SANDERS

31
00:00:54,047 --> 00:00:56,783
SAID THE PRESIDENT IS OPEN TO

32
00:00:56,783 --> 00:00:59,152
HAVING KAVANAUGH'S NOW SECOND

33
00:00:59,152 --> 00:00:59,652
ACCUSER TESTIFY.

34
00:00:59,652 --> 00:01:01,321
HERE'S DEMOCRAT KIRSTEN

35
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:01,988
GILLIBRAND.

36
00:01:01,988 --> 00:01:02,856
>> I'VE HEARD FROM BOTH SIDES

37
00:01:02,856 --> 00:01:10,497
AND I BELIEVE DR. BLASEY FORD

38
00:01:10,497 --> 00:01:15,568
AND I BELIEVE MR. MIRRORS.

39
00:01:15,568 --> 00:01:16,436
IT'S NOT THE RESPONSE OF SOMEONE

40
00:01:16,436 --> 00:01:17,771
WHO WANTS TO PLEAD HIS

41
00:01:17,771 --> 00:01:19,072
INNOCENCE, YOU HAVE WOMEN

42
00:01:19,072 --> 00:01:19,806
TELLING THE STORIES ABOUT WHAT

43
00:01:19,806 --> 00:01:23,710
HAPPENED TO THEM AND CREDIBLY

44
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,377
ACCUSING JUDGE KAVANAUGH OF

45
00:01:24,377 --> 00:01:27,847
VIOLENT BEHAVIOR, OF

46
00:01:27,847 --> 00:01:28,581
SEXUAL ASSAULT, OF BEHAVIOR THAT

47
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:31,618
IS DISQUALIFYING.

48
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:33,553
>> Harris: LET'S BRING IN

49
00:01:33,553 --> 00:01:34,788
COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT

50
00:01:34,788 --> 00:01:35,755
KELLYANNE CONWAY.

51
00:01:35,755 --> 00:01:36,823
THIS IS A HUGE NEWSMAKING DAY

52
00:01:36,823 --> 00:01:40,960
AHEAD OF WHAT'S HAPPENING ON

53
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,327
THURSDAY.

54
00:01:41,327 --> 00:01:44,164
I WANT TO START IF WE CAN, THE

55
00:01:44,164 --> 00:01:44,964
PRESIDENT'S DEFENSE OF JUDGE

56
00:01:44,964 --> 00:01:45,598
KAVANAUGH TODAY.

57
00:01:45,598 --> 00:01:47,367
EVEN THOUGH HE SAID HE WAS OPEN

58
00:01:47,367 --> 00:01:50,570
TO HEARING A SECOND ACCUSER.

59
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,807
>> THAT MAY BE A LITTLE

60
00:01:53,807 --> 00:01:54,507
PREMATURE BECAUSE THE SENATE

61
00:01:54,507 --> 00:01:57,177
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE DECIDES WHO

62
00:01:57,177 --> 00:01:59,012
WILL TESTIFY ON THURSDAY AND I

63
00:01:59,012 --> 00:02:00,814
THINK WE NEED TO DEFER TO THEM.

64
00:02:00,814 --> 00:02:03,183
AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THE

65
00:02:03,183 --> 00:02:05,385
COMMITTEE IS TAKING THE

66
00:02:05,385 --> 00:02:06,086
TESTIMONY OF DOCTOR FOR IT OF

67
00:02:06,086 --> 00:02:07,387
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

68
00:02:07,387 --> 00:02:09,756
BUT IT'S WITHIN AN HOUR OF THAT

69
00:02:09,756 --> 00:02:13,994
ARTICLE GOING ONLINE THE OTHER

70
00:02:13,994 --> 00:02:16,096
NIGHT, A THINLY SOURCED, WIDELY

71
00:02:16,096 --> 00:02:18,365
CRITICIZED BY PEERS IN THE MEDIA

72
00:02:18,365 --> 00:02:20,300
ARTICLE IN THE NEW YORKER ABOUT

73
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:20,834
THE SECOND ACCUSER.

74
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:23,971
THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS DID REACH

75
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:25,072
OUT TO MR. MIRRORS AND ASK IF

76
00:02:25,072 --> 00:02:27,808
SHE WOULD LIKE TO ADD ANYTHING.

77
00:02:27,808 --> 00:02:29,376
SO THEY WILL TAKE STATEMENTS,

78
00:02:29,376 --> 00:02:30,043
THEY WILL TAKE ANYTHING SHE

79
00:02:30,043 --> 00:02:34,414
WOULD LIKE TO OFFER AND THAT'S

80
00:02:34,414 --> 00:02:36,216
HOW THE PROCESS WORKS.

81
00:02:36,216 --> 00:02:38,318
THIS IS A PROCESS BEING BY THE

82
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:40,587
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.

83
00:02:40,587 --> 00:02:42,856
LET'S NOT FORGET, THIS IS NOT A

84
00:02:42,856 --> 00:02:44,224
LEGAL PROCEEDING OR CRIMINAL

85
00:02:44,224 --> 00:02:44,925
PROCEEDING, IT IS STILL THE

86
00:02:44,925 --> 00:02:48,962
SENATE CONFIRMATION HEARING OF A

87
00:02:48,962 --> 00:02:50,197
NOMINEE TO THE UNITED STATES

88
00:02:50,197 --> 00:02:50,831
SUPREME COURT JUDGE BRETT

89
00:02:50,831 --> 00:02:51,365
KAVANAUGH.

90
00:02:51,365 --> 00:02:52,566
THIS WILL BE PART OF THAT.

91
00:02:52,566 --> 00:02:56,236
THURSDAY IS ABOUT THE TWO OF

92
00:02:56,236 --> 00:02:58,005
THEM, JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS MADE

93
00:02:58,005 --> 00:03:00,174
VERY CLEAR IN A WIDE RANGE OF

94
00:03:00,174 --> 00:03:01,408
INTERVIEWS, HIS WIFE BY HIS

95
00:03:01,408 --> 00:03:03,410
SIDE, THAT HE'S BEEN WILLING TO

96
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,412
TESTIFY SINCE HE FOUND OUT THE

97
00:03:05,412 --> 00:03:06,780
NAME OF THE ACCUSER.

98
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,482
HE WAS WILLING TO TESTIFY WHEN

99
00:03:08,482 --> 00:03:09,416
SHE WAS STILL ANONYMOUS BECAUSE

100
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:10,350
HE IS CONFIDENT IN SAYING AS HE

101
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,020
HAS MANY TIMES, AND ONLY HE CAN

102
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,123
SAY THIS, THAT HE WAS AT NO SUCH

103
00:03:16,123 --> 00:03:16,790
PARTY, HE HAD NEVER TREATED

104
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,960
ANYONE LIKE THIS.

105
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,595
>> Harris: JUST A QUICK

106
00:03:21,595 --> 00:03:23,497
FOLLOW, THE PRESIDENT CALLING

107
00:03:23,497 --> 00:03:25,365
THIS A "CON GAME" BY DEMOCRATS,

108
00:03:25,365 --> 00:03:28,802
I WANT TO GET YOUR FINAL THOUGHT

109
00:03:28,802 --> 00:03:29,303
ON THIS.

110
00:03:29,303 --> 00:03:30,638
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS A POINT.

111
00:03:30,638 --> 00:03:33,207
IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE

112
00:03:33,207 --> 00:03:34,008
PROCESS, WHY DID THE DEMOCRATS

113
00:03:34,008 --> 00:03:35,643
SIT ON THIS LETTER ALL THIS

114
00:03:35,643 --> 00:03:35,943
TIME?

115
00:03:35,943 --> 00:03:39,880
AFTER 30 HOURS OF SWORN

116
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,617
TESTIMONY, HE HAS ACADEMIC

117
00:03:43,617 --> 00:03:45,019
CREDENTIALS AND IMPECCABLE

118
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:46,787
INTEGRITY AND CHARACTER AND

119
00:03:46,787 --> 00:03:47,989
QUALIFICATIONS BEYOND REPROACH.

120
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:49,590
MANY OF THEM WERE RAISING MONEY

121
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,791
FOR THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL

122
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,227
ELECTIONS INSTEAD OF ASKING THE

123
00:03:53,227 --> 00:03:54,128
JUDGE ABOUT LEGAL PRECEDENT

124
00:03:54,128 --> 00:03:54,829
BECAUSE THEY ALREADY MADE UP

125
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:56,697
THEIR MINDS THAT THEY ARE NOT

126
00:03:56,697 --> 00:03:57,631
GOING TO SUPPORT HIM.

127
00:03:57,631 --> 00:04:00,167
THE PRESIDENT'S POINT IS AS I

128
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:03,037
SAID YESTERDAY, THIS IS BECOMING

129
00:04:03,037 --> 00:04:04,005
A LEFT-WING CONSPIRACY.

130
00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:06,407
A LOT OF DEMOCRATS, CONSULTANTS,

131
00:04:06,407 --> 00:04:08,209
HOLLYWOOD FOLKS AND OTHERS OF

132
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:10,011
THE LEFT WING IN CAHOOTS,

133
00:04:10,011 --> 00:04:12,046
CODDLING EACH OTHER, DEFINITELY

134
00:04:12,046 --> 00:04:13,481
COACHING EACH OTHER ON THIS.

135
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:17,584
THERE IS NO QUESTION.

136
00:04:17,584 --> 00:04:18,853
>> Harris: THE DEFINITION OF

137
00:04:18,853 --> 00:04:19,987
WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS CALLING A

138
00:04:19,987 --> 00:04:20,421
CON GAME.

139
00:04:20,421 --> 00:04:23,991
I WANT TO GET TO ROD ROSENSTEIN.

140
00:04:23,991 --> 00:04:24,725
THE PRESIDENT MEETING WITH HIS

141
00:04:24,725 --> 00:04:27,795
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL.

142
00:04:27,795 --> 00:04:28,496
PRESS SECRETARY SARAH SANDERS

143
00:04:28,496 --> 00:04:32,366
SAYS THAT IF ROD ROSENSTEIN

144
00:04:32,366 --> 00:04:34,368
EXITS, HOWEVER HE EXITS, THAT

145
00:04:34,368 --> 00:04:35,636
COULD BEGIN THE END OF THE

146
00:04:35,636 --> 00:04:36,337
ROBERT MUELLER INVESTIGATION.

147
00:04:36,337 --> 00:04:38,172
WHAT IS THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING

148
00:04:38,172 --> 00:04:38,639
ABOUT THAT NOW?

149
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,208
>> THE PRESIDENT MADE THE POINT

150
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:43,611
YESTERDAY THAT ON THURSDAY HE

151
00:04:43,611 --> 00:04:45,446
WILL MEET WITH THE DEPUTY

152
00:04:45,446 --> 00:04:47,181
ATTORNEY GENERAL, HE MET WITH

153
00:04:47,181 --> 00:04:48,616
THE CHIEF OF STAFF AT THE

154
00:04:48,616 --> 00:04:51,018
WHITE HOUSE, THEY PARTICIPATED

155
00:04:51,018 --> 00:04:55,790
IN A MEETING ON OTHER ISSUES.

156
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,991
SOME OF THE MEDIA ARE ALWAYS

157
00:04:56,991 --> 00:04:57,725
SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT PEOPLE

158
00:04:57,725 --> 00:05:00,761
COME TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND

159
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:03,798
JUSTICE DOES THAT ROUTINELY.

160
00:05:03,798 --> 00:05:04,565
THE PRESIDENT AND MR. ROSENSTEIN

161
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:07,035
WILL HAVE TO MAKE THOSE

162
00:05:07,035 --> 00:05:11,372
DECISIONS I GUESS ON THURSDAY.

163
00:05:11,372 --> 00:05:11,973
AS FOR THE MUELLER

164
00:05:11,973 --> 00:05:13,208
INVESTIGATION -- THAT'S UP TO

165
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,577
THE PRESIDENT, I HAVE NOT HEARD

166
00:05:15,577 --> 00:05:17,579
THAT AND I THINK YESTERDAY WAS A

167
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:19,180
TERRIBLE DAY FOR THE MEDIA

168
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,115
GETTING THEIR INFORMATION FROM

169
00:05:21,115 --> 00:05:23,785
TWITTER, FROM FAULTY SOURCES,

170
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:24,485
PEOPLE WHO COULD NOT POSSIBLY

171
00:05:24,485 --> 00:05:26,788
HAVE KNOWN WHAT WAS GOING ON.

172
00:05:26,788 --> 00:05:28,790
HE'S ON THE JOB TODAY, HE WAS ON

173
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,390
THE JOB YESTERDAY.

174
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,425
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO MEET HIM

175
00:05:30,425 --> 00:05:33,394
IN PERSON ON THURSDAY.

176
00:05:33,394 --> 00:05:34,429
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, AS

177
00:05:34,429 --> 00:05:38,366
RUN BY THE LAST ADMINISTRATION,

178
00:05:38,366 --> 00:05:40,001
WAS ROTTEN TO THE CORE AT THE

179
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:41,970
TOP OF THE FBI.

180
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,172
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT CAME TO

181
00:05:44,172 --> 00:05:45,373
PUTTING THEIR THUMB ON THE

182
00:05:45,373 --> 00:05:47,542
SCALES TO GET HILLARY CLINTON

183
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:47,909
ELECTED.

184
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:51,579
THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE -- I

185
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:53,748
SEE A PATTERN HERE, PERHAPS.

186
00:05:53,748 --> 00:05:56,084
JIM COMEY FIRED FROM THE FBI HAD

187
00:05:56,084 --> 00:05:57,986
TAKEN NOTES, GOT A BOOK DEAL AND

188
00:05:57,986 --> 00:05:58,953
LEAKED SOME OF THOSE NOTES TO

189
00:05:58,953 --> 00:06:00,855
