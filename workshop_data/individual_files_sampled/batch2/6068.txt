so Trump's giving a campaign rally tonight why look I give him credit for them because I the guy at least goes down makes his case which Obama never did so anyway he's out there and he says you ever noticed how they call the other side elite Mike you're the one who called them elites that you ran a whole populist campaign calling them elites so where are you going with this one he goes well I mean they're not elite I'm the one that has a nicer apartment than them and I'm smarter than them and I'm richer than them I'm Nili and the crowd applauds what I thought you guys were against the elites the whole shtick of the right-wing and certainly Trump in 2016 was the global financial elites and they're robbing you and they're this and they're that and by the way that's actually again to give him another piece of credit smart populism right but now the manga guys have lost their minds so much then he's like actually I'm the real elite I'm more elite than they are and they're like huh what but yeah standing ovations now the manga guys who hated Hillary Clinton because she was part of the elites are cheering Donald Trump for being more elite than them does it have to make sense once you start following someone on blind faith and you've lost track of rationality and reason and you're just going off your emotions and you become fully authoritarian nothing has to make sense anymore so congratulations right-wing voters you're now for the elites you must be so proud
