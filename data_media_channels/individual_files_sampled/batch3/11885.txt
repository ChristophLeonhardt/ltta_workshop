right well let's get the views now of Annie Mass Sean she's a former mi5 intelligence officer and joins us this afternoon thanks for coming on Annie look we're hearing that Ecuador has said this situation can't go on forever we're now in talks with the British authorities many people see that is bad news for Assange is that how you see it I think it's certainly worrying for a sans yes there's no doubt about it because the incoming president in Ecuador seems to see him as a problem he's also under pressure from the Americans and from the International Monetary Fund to raise funding for his country and apparently there it's been speculated reported there have been threats that this might be withheld if they don't if he does not resolve the Assange case but let's bear in mind that Assange not only has been given political asylum and that was sifted over and weighed up legally for weeks before Ecuador did this so you know the case is strong but he's also now an Ecuadorian citizen and the Ecuadorians tried to give him status as a diplomat - so to hand him over to the Brits to face justice for jumping bail sure you know who might get one year in prison maximum but I think he's right to be worried about being extradited onwards to the United States where his organization WikiLeaks has already been categorized by Michael Pompeo as a hostile intelligence agency where politicians been calling for his assassination for the death penalty for the rest of his life in prison and all for publishing just as any other media organization publishes if if it's true because I know at the moment that this speculation isn't it to a degree but if Ecuador is bowing to US pressure why on earth wouldn't they just say okay Julian sorry you've got to go why you negotiate what is there to negotiate that's my question well I'm not sure if there are many negotiations I mean you know at any moment they could just chuck him out of the embassy that's the problem and of course he will be arrested by the British authorities because of the bail conditions that he broke I think the problem with then is will Britain bow to the pressures from the USA to have him extradited to to the USA to stand trial under who knows what conditions I mean speculation is that there has been a secret grand jury convened in Virginia for years now the speculation that even though he's an Australian who's never actually had much to do with America that he would be prosecuted under the American Espionage Act I mean this is the sort of completely off the scale so I think the concern is what the British will do and of course the British government isn't also a very difficult position with brexit they can't afford to annoy their American cousins too much at this juncture of British history so it's a bit of a mess every which way sure one thing that always seems to get excluded here is that the UN ruled that a sound should actually be allowed to go free that's always seems to be ignored whenever it's brought up with the UK US authorities absolutely I mean this was a landmark case over the last few years much as you know the the politicized accusations made against him by the Swedes have been dropped nobody seems to remember that they were timed out and then dropped voluntarily by the Swedish and the UN does see that what he's been forced to live in the Ecuadorian Embassy is cruel and unusual punishment and for what I mean people call him a whistleblower he's not they call him a hacker who hacked the DNC he's not what he is what Julian Assange is fundamentally is a publisher he provides a high-tech conduit for news outlets and for whistleblowers particularly and over the decade of the WikiLeaks existence they have not been found factually wrong in any case whatsoever so you know this is very worrying I think for the mainstream media across the West as well because if you have the New York Times for example publishing whistleblower disclosures or The Washington Post all the Guardian all the Sunday Times and they don't stand up for the rights of a fellow publisher Julian Assange the chief editor of WikiLeaks then in future they might indeed be finding themselves prosecute for a publishing whistleblower disclosures themselves and this is the very nub of the issue it's about press freedom it's about freedom of speech any good to talk to you would have to leave it there that was any mash on a former mi5 intelligence officer thank you you
