particularly the younger people don't

not necessarily joiners or liking to

label ourselves and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's</font>

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:17,279
call myself a feminist in the classic

nail and it certainly is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pro</font>

12
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,000
abortion in this context and I'm neither

anti-male or program so there's an

14
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,130
individual feminism if you will that you

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,290
make your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> choices Mercedes I look at</font>

19
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,820
little bit disappointing and revealing

is that I hope will get better is turns

out a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of women they just have a</font>

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,789
problem with women in power you know

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole sisterhood this whole let's</font>

go March for women's right and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

25
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,110
just constantly talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what women</font>

look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like or what they wear or making</font>

fun of their choices or presuming that

they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as powerful as the men</font>

29
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,170
around this presumptive negativity about

30
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,720
women and power I think it's very

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,330
unfortunate because let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just try to</font>

32
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,070
access that and have a conversation

33
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,170
about it rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> a confrontation</font>

34
00:01:13,170 --> 00:00:00,000
about it
