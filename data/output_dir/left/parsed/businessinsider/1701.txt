the first piece of advice was trust
yourself and know that ultimately
regardless of the day-to-day news cycles
and the noise that the American people
need their president to succeed
regardless of political party which I
thought was very generous um the second
piece of advice is always use Purell
hand sanitizer because if you don't
you're gonna get a lot of a lot of colds
because you shake a lot of hands
