Tucker: "NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTER AMY SPENT MORE TIME COVERING HILLARY CLINTON THAN ANY LIVING PERSON. THROUGH TWO PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS AND A DECADE SHE HAS A NEW BOOK OUT CALLED CHASING HILLARY, 10 YEARS, TWO CAMPAIGNS ONE INTACT GLASS CEILING DESCRIBE AS LOT ABOUT HILLARY PROFANE TIRADES AGAINST TRUMP. WHOP DER HOW MANY MEN ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT SURROUNDED CLINTON. SHE SAYS SHE WAS BY HILLARY. THANKS FOR COMING ON. YOU HAVE TAKEN GRIEF FOR THIS BOOK FROM THE RIGHT THAT SAYS YOU CONCEDE IN THE BOOK THAT HAD YOU AFFINITY FOR HILLARY, YOU SHARE HER POLITICS. I WANT TO SAY AT THE OUTSET I LIKE THE FACT THAT YOU WERE HONEST ABOUT IT UNLIKE A LOT OF REPORTERS YOU HAVE TO GUESS. YOU WERE DIRECT AND I APPRECIATE IT GIVEN THAT THE MILLER PEOPLE ARE SNIPING ABOUT YOU AND COMPLAINING ABOUT YOU LIKE YOU ARE THE PROBLEM. WHY? SEEMS TO SAY A LOT ABOUT THEM. EXACTLY. APPARENTLY THIS IS THE BOOK THAT THE CLINTONS DON'T WANT YOU TO READ. AS YOU POINT OUT IT IS PARTLY SYMPATHETIC TO HER. I ANTICIPATED THE BLOW BACK. PART OF WHAT I GET INTO IN THE BOOK IS THAT THERE IS NO GRAY AREA FOR HILLARY CLINTON, YOU ARE EITHER COMPLETELY DEVOTED TO HER OR AN ENEMY. A LOT OF THE TIME MY COVERAGE WAS IN BETWEEN. AND SOMETIMES I WROTE SOME TOUGH STORIES. I WAS THE BEAT REPORTER COVERING THIS CAMPAIGN DAY IN AND DAY OUT. SO, YOU KNOW, THERE WASN'T A LOT OF GRAY AREA. YOU WERE EITHER THE ENEMY OR YOU WERE, YOU KNOW, COMPLETELY DEVOTED. Tucker: BUT I MEAN, HOW SORT OF OUT OF IT DO YOU HAVE TO BE AND I KNOW THE CLINTON PEOPLE FEEL THIS WAY THINK THE "NEW YORK TIMES" IS TOO RIGHT WING TO COVER HILLARY CLINTON. THEY HAVE SAID THAT TO ME SO I KNOW THEY ACTUALLY FEEL THAT WAY. WHAT PLANET ARE THEY ON. THEY ARE ON PLANET HILLARY WHICH I HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT EXTENSIVELY. ONE OF THE THEMES IN THE BOOK THAT YOUR VIEWERS WILL FIND SURPRISING DECADES LONG BATTLE BETWEEN THE "NEW YORK TIMES" AND THE CLINTON CAMP, SOMETHING I WAS MY EABOUT WHEN I WAS PUT ON THE BEAT IN 2013. I HADN'T ANTICIPATED THAT HER AIDS WOULD ESSENTIALLY BLAME ME FOR THE WHITE WATER SCANDAL WHICH, TUCKER, HAPPENED WHEN I WAS 12. BUT THERE IS ALL THIS WHICH, OF COURSE, THE "NEW YORK TIMES" BROKE. THERE IS ALL THIS BAD BLOOD PASSED ON BETWEEN THE CLINTS AND "NEW YORK TIMES" FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION OF WHICH I WAS A RECIPIENT PUT ON HER 2016 CAMPAIGN. I THINK IT WOULD SURPRISE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT THAT AN NO, AN, ANIMOSITY EXISTS. Tucker: CHELSEA IS MAD AT AT YOU. CHELSEA SENT 30 TWEETS IN THE PAST FEW DAYS CRITICIZING SOME OF MY REPORTING. Tucker: LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. SO YOU SAID IN THE BOOK I THINK I KNEW THIS OVERWHELMING BEAT REPORTER COVERING HILLARY WAS A WOMEN. HILLARY WAS RUNNING A CAMPAIGN IF SHE CAMPAIGN SF SHE CAMPAIGN SHESHE CAMPAIGN SHE WE CAMPAIGN SHE WAS A WOMAN: YOU KNOW THAT'S KIND OF STACK AGO DECK A LITTLE BIT. DO YOU SEE A PROBLEM WITH THAT ARRANGEMENT? THAT'S INTERESTING. BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS IN THE BOOK THAT I POINTS OUT IS LIKE HILLARY ACTUALLY LIKED THE GUYS. LIKE YOUR VERY OWN ED HENRY WOULD GRILL HER ABOUT OTHER EMAILS AND SHE KIND OF LIKED SHE LIKED THE BANTER WITH HIM. SHE WAS FLIRTY WITH SOME OF THE GUYS. I DON'T THINK THERE WAS A PARTICULAR LIKE LOVE FEST BECAUSE WOMEN WERE COVERING HER. IF ANYTHING, I THINK THERE WAS THE PERCEPTION THAT WOMEN MIGHT BE TOUGHER ON HER TO KIND OF PROVE, YOU KNOW, THE COUNTER TO YOUR POINT. TO PROVE WE WEREN'T IN THE TANK. Tucker: IS SHE THE FIRST SELF-DESCRIBED FEMINIST YOU HAVE EVER MET HARDER ON I CANNOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION. Tucker: I THINK WE BOTH
