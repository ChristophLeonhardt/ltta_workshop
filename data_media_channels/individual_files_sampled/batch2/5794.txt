welcome back since we're here in Florida and since I'm from Florida it should be no surprise that tonight I'm obsessed with something that has to do with Florida and no it's not the quarterback situation down in Coral Gables people move here for a lot of reasons for retirement for the beaches but there's no income tax for the water for the warmth whatever Florida may be the one state in the country where climate change is an a polarizing issue everyone here knows it's happening everybody can tell you what a beach looked like before what an island looked like before here etc here you can see it in the rising temperatures awfully warm ocean in October for instance here you can see it in the rising water levels and here you can see it in the rising red tide on the on the gulf side we've had the algae blooms pop on both the atlantic side and some fear that that's coming on this side concern all these areas where salt water meets fresh water into killing fields for fish I spoke with a charter boat captain in the Tampa area we've been working 10 to 12 hours a day picking up dead fish she had one message for the next governor get to work right away on Lake Okeechobee get to work right away start putting regulations back on our water we have got to have rules to protect these waters because they are literally being destroyed and without our waters what do we have every day we're shaking our heads we don't care the politics thing wrong we don't care if we're democrat we don't care for a Republican we are one that says it's time to put our politics aside step up to the plate pull up your pants and let's get to work and get this salt all right she's a fish boat captain and you may think she's got a business reason to care so much about this but this cuts across party lines affect this issue was so potent and when I went to a gun shop today to talk about guns guess what the first person that I talked to wanted to talk about cleaning up the environment take care of this red tide the fisherman and it's destroyed by hobby and my lifelong pursuit that's the point here this is to the state of Florida what the Flint water crisis was to the state of Michigan hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our channel so thank you now do me a favor subscribe by clicking on that button down there click on any of the videos to watch the latest interviews and highlights from MTV daily and MSNBC you get more Meet the Press content every morning and the first read newsletter if you're tired of content that you don't know anything about where it came from you don't have to have that problem with us NBC News MSNBC MTP and the Meet the Press mindset right here for you on YouTube subscribe now
