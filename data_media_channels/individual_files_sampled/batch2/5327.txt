joining me now is a now a friend of the show we like to say Jane Reiter she's the fire chief and hunting in West Virginia which has become known as the overdose capital of America and she's the focus of course of the oscar-nominated documentary heroine which was a part of the first ever Meet the Press film festival last November I look forward to seeing you on the red carpet on Sunday Jan but let me ask you this since the declaration how have you been assisted so the declaration of this is a public health emergency how is this help to you do what you do to fight on the front lines it has not helped me at all check and I thank you for having me today what has helped us in Huntington West Virginia is we have become a city of solutions and we have band together to come up with innovative programs to help those suffering from substance use disorder your mayor was there at the summit today was his goal to find out what the government's doing or was his goal more of guys this is what you're not doing let me tell you how you can help I think that you know we have band together as a city of solutions and we're looking for partners at the state level in the federal level and until they start funding programs that that we're trying to push you know we're behind the eight ball here we need help we need more funding all right to help us get help for our people there's obviously there's a lot of priorities here I remember one of the times I had you on I said okay what's one thing right now and you said narcan I never have enough narcan alright is that really how this should be prioritized it's like number one it's an epidemic we've got to stop it in its tracks then you move on to addiction and recovery then you move on to education then we start talking the bigger picture here prevention looking for alternative is that we need to work backwards here sort of stop the you know stop the bleeding first well the narcan actually keeps people alive because they have to be alive before they can go into long-term recovery and then we have a big focus on trying to get people into term recovery so technically we really have to do a multi-faceted approach we have to start talking in the schools at a very early age prevention is key we need to help those suffering to get into long-term treatment and we need to work on the the laws on how we are able to prescribe so we don't have another generation of those suffering from addiction that got started from a legal prescription of opiates about a month ago I know we checked in behind the scenes and you were almost all excited you said we almost had an easy road a zero overdose day we almost didn't yeah Huntington Fire Department had a zero day but unfortunately Cabell County EMS did go on to date two overdoses that day so but I will say this we have experienced a decline in the number of overdoses over the past six months we have decline in people friends and family using narcan in the field and we're excited about that we feel like the innovative programs that we are starting here in Huntington are truly making a difference just two months ago we started a quick response team and what that does is it sends a paramedic somebody in the mental health field and a police officer out to visit people who have overdosed within 72 hours of their overdose and right now our numbers are very promising 38% of those individuals that the team has make contact with are now in recovery getting rid of the supply is a big deal I know they've been some pledges by drug companies to pull back on how much they make pull back on their recommendations to doctors have you seen any progress in just the you know fewer opioids available not at this time but I look for it in the in the coming year I think 2018 is going to be a good year for Huntington in the state of West Virginia I think we're we're starting to do some things that are really going to turn the tide here is it just it does feel as if the fact is that finally a spotlight has been put on this at least as far as West Virginia's concern you have gotten the attention of everybody that matters to West Virginia just that in itself has that just gotten the community to be you know saying what should I do better is that what you've noticed well I I think that the heroin has highlighted the hard work and the commitment of strong West Virginians and that how you know we're resilient and we will not give up and we are going to do our best and I think that that that documentary starts many conversations that need to happen and until then I don't think a lot of people were really focused on what's going on on the front lines and you've got to know what's going on on the front lines to make a difference you know it is and that's how the best way I'm I think many people will learn a lot from you when they watch this documentary chief Reiter good to see you I look forward to seeing you Sunday thank you sir I appreciate it I hope I'm
