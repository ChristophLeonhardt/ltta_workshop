last night one more victory one more victory last night to talk about was in Idaho the governor's race primary now we we were live until about 8:30 I think our local time and at that point that race had gotten up to about 8 percent reporting maybe 11 percent reporting and at that point Paulette Jordan was running the Democratic primary was up and it looked by a pretty dominant amount but we weren't sure and so it was great to find out that much later in the night Paulette Jordan did actually end up winning she put out a statement of victory saying we are not afraid and never again will we stand down um it's a number of other incredibly positive five things that she said to both the people that supported her campaign workers and things of that sort I had 60% of the vote I get out facing Ballack off the 2014 Democratic nominee who this time got 38% and if you're not familiar was Paulette Jordan as our revolution endorsed candidate strong progressive yeah and could well be the next governor of Idaho she ruff talked him run him off so this is also very consequential race look again note for the record for if she won she would be the first female Native American governor in American history that's great of course we care about her stance Anna and her issues and our policies and with any candidate your never never gonna get every single thing that you want in particular or I one in particular everybody's different right and every state is different so for example she's for gun rights okay in Idaho you gotta be for gun rights so got gunned down okay know at a moment's notice and by the way it good the gun issue in Idaho is significantly different than it is in Connecticut or Florida and etcetera and that doesn't mean she's for all the things that the NRA wants not remotely right so it's you have to do nuanced but get that out of the way she's wonderfully progressive on so many issues almost all of them she says she nothing's gonna get in her way is she's gonna fight with every single ounce of her life for access to health care and better education and and so balakov was 72 years old he's wealthy he's been in democratic politics for a long time and everybody says he's a really nice guy but he sees more than a lot of the politicians or almost all of them endorsed him the Democrats in the state and when asked they're like well I'm not an AJ a long time and he's such a sweet guy and so sometimes the establishment supporting a candidate is not even nefarious they just know the guy right around for a long time yeah and but you must let the new guard and the progressive populist take a shot at this thing because we know what belicoff's gonna do he did it in 2014 and we know he's gonna get his ass handed to just like he did at that time again no offense but why do we keep doing the same thing and conventional wisdom in Washington is uh people like Paulette Jordan are ruining it we were gonna win by being centrist but now they're being really liberal you're never gonna win in Idaho it's so red look it is exceedingly difficult for any Democrat to win an ID oh that's true but at least if you run as it our thesis if you're on as a populist progressive you at least got a shot if you run as a centrist corporate friendly Democrat you have no chance we already did that a thousand times and we have literally lost a thousand seats at the state level so today you know it Steve Kornacki he put out a tweet it's not him saying it but he's saying in in Washington DC they considered Cara Eastman's win so that's in Nebraska she's a justice Democrat she beat Brad Ashford who was a former Democratic congressman and who had lost by the way he had lost the seat because he ran as a centrist corporate friendly conservative Democrat and they thought oh man Brad Ashford even though he lost before he could win this thing cuz he's gonna be so centrist in Nebraska and they called Keira Eastman swin an own-goal you know in soccer when you score on your self they're like uh progressives you don't know anything you blew it there I mean that not only hurt our cars well wait a minute you centrist in Washington you're the ones who lost a thousand seats at the state level 69 out of 99 state legislators you lost that White House you two Trump you lost the Senate you lost the house so doesn't any reporter ask them hey on what grounds logically factually do you have to stand on where you could say I know what I'm doing and you don't hey we should try this strategy again we should try that strategy again that's the very last strategy we should try we should try people like Paula Jordan and Keira Eastman and and I I would be shocked if she didn't stand no way better chance populism works it walks works all across the country it works all across the world so let Paulette run with this thing and luckily it's not up to them because we had a vote and she crushed the establishment candidate and and I hope that she keeps that intensity up runs is a real progressive and as a populist in Idaho and say I'm not gonna listen to the elites I'm not gonna listen to corporations I'm gonna stick up for you that can win it could win anywhere including Idaho too easy wasteful young turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and ii is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube you're
