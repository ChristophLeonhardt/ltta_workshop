Houston's police chief art acevedo was recently on Face the Nation on CBS and he was talking about the shooting that took place in Santa Fe Texas and he actually had something different to say from every other public official we've heard from from the state of Texas take a listen and you look ahead to see how we can do better next time because there will be a next time based on the inaction of elected officials across this country who specifically are you faulting for not taking action well let me tell you and people at the state level and the federal level and too many places in our country are not doing anything other than offering prayers we need to start using the ballot box and ballot initiatives to take the matters out of the hands of people are doing nothing that our elected and in the hands of the people to see that the will of the people in this country is actually carried out so he did say something very different from what we've heard from other elected officials in Texas he actually does want gun control and by the way he mentioned the fact that the recent shooter in Santa Fe had obtained the weapons from his father who legally had the guns and he believes that the father should face some potential charges for not securely you know placing his guns in a place that his son wouldn't have access and I think that that's a legitimate point I mean oftentimes when we talk about gun owners who legally purchase their guns we never discussed gun safety we never discuss making sure that they're storing their guns in a safe place where other people can't get access to them so I love that he brought that up it's really important to talk about it yeah and if you're a cop you should be concerned about gun control more than anyone else so that that makes a ton of sense it puts your life in danger part of the reason why sometimes they're so jittery because everybody's got a gun so they're like I'm not gonna wait I'm just going to shoot just to make sure and he's not just talking about voting out politicians which I love that kind of talk but he's also saying do ballot initiatives which is an interesting out-of-the-box unique idea so that maybe you could do an end run around our corrupt politicians and we put it to the people 93% want gun control including a majority of gun owners so I think that has a great chance of winning so that means countdown to Fox News attacking this guy and the NRA and the politicians that they fund trying to get them fired three two one watch two easy ways follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube you're notified of our videos you
