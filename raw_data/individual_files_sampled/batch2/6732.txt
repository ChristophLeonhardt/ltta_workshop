alright guys breaking news ladies and gentlemen we did not get him Brad Kavanagh has been confirmed as the next US Supreme Court justice where he might serve 3040 years think about it whatever your age is if you're 17 he's gonna he might serve till you're 47 52 if you're 40 he might serve til you're 75 80 years old he's on that Court he's only 53 years old so what was the final vote 52 48 it's by a razor thin margin but they didn't need it to be much greater than that so who voted yes who voted no Lisa Murkowski stuck with a proclamation from earlier and basically voted no she technically voted present but good enough for as a no vote she's the only Republican who voted no that means that Jeff Flake for all of his talk at the end said Oh Cavanaugh brilliant really I do declare brilliant so he voted yes you go to with Trump you voted for Kent with Kavanagh so all the things in the elevator and the listenings of sexual assault survivors and being concerned about perjury lalalalala at the end of the day like almost all Republicans Jeff Flake from time to time talks a big game and at the end of the day votes with every other Republican and unfortunately in this case we basically told you that's what flake does every time okay so all none of the others with the exception on one person were even endowed to Bob corkers that said it now they were always gonna vote yeah yes and they overall voted yes so the only other Republican in doubt was Susan Collins she oftentimes votes with Murkowski or both theoretically pro-choice Republicans there is no such thing Susan Collins with a lengthy ridiculous speech at the end of the day boats yes because she's a Republican what did you think they were gonna do so she votes yes and I told you there are no moderate Republicans I went on a long spiel about this on one of the primary nights voting for a Republican northeast snap out of it it's not 30 years ago when there were liberal Republicans or moderate Republicans I know because I was one of those liberal Republicans there's no such thing Susan Collins voted with Mitch McConnell Lindsey Graham John Cornyn all the most conservative people in the country her vote was identical now luckily there's people that are raising money against her based on this vote by last count it was at least three million dollars that they had raised to give to her opponent if she voted YES on Kavanagh she voted YES on Kavanagh hey Susan Collins I got a note for you you don't like money in politics she's crying about it every day she cries oh my god they're raising money against me it's like bribery are you kidding me you take bribes every single day from your corporate friends and you just gave your corporate friends a giant gift Cavanaugh almost always votes for giant corporations you vote for allowed two corporations to have you get killed on the job and you get no compensation that's the SeaWorld case so they're thrilled with cabin odd like that we could even kill our employees and they're gonna get nothing for it Susan Collins you voted for that so never ever ever pretend that you're a moderate Republican again there is no such thing if you're in the Northeast and you're a Democrat or independent and you think you're getting a moderate and a Republican you are never getting any such thing now you're gonna get someone that boasts lockstep with Donald Trump that's who you're gonna get that's who Susan Collins is so I hope that they use that three million maybe it'll get to four million to go crush her and put a progressive into that seat and that Maine's got no business putting in a senator voting for Kavanagh who might destroy Roe versus Wade okay and now he's going in there super pissed he's gonna vote if you thought he was gonna vote against the Democrats before one number one you were right because he's a Karl Rove acolyte he's always been a Republican say it with me apparatchik that's what he is he's a hatchet man so now he's even angrier with a larger hatchet and he's going to be on the Supreme Court for decade after decade there's one caveat to that which I'll get to in a second by the way I mentioned the primary nights earlier look we cover every election night and on November 6 it's gonna be in Bonanza and there could be consequences of this vote that they just did so we'll see you on November 6 the North remembers progressives remember I hope they remember in every single election registered a vote at TYT dot-com / register make sure you're watching live on election night t y-t-dot-com / live and for God's sake we're the home of progressives let's all stick together fight together come join us at EIT dot-com /join okay so Collins voted but if you're doing the math and you're really good at politics you won't now wondering we now hold on now it doesn't quite get you to 50 so what happened well of course a democratic vote voted yes as well and if you've been following us at all you know it's gonna be Joe Manchin and I remember when the Justice Democrats primary dim with apology and Swearengen and what did he do what did everybody do in Washington they cried oh my god what are you guys doing that's a democratic incumbent and what would where would we be without Joe Manchin my question to you now is where are we with Joe Manchin we told you we told you he'd vote with the Republicans and the worst of possible scenarios and he did a man accused of sexual assault credibly so from several different women didn't care the men who voted was in favor of citizens united loves Citizens United believes corporations are human beings that these are not bribes that you give the politicians he lied on the stand Kavanagh did couple during hearing several different times any uneven even not related to the sexual assault he did also on sexual assault but also in the case of Miranda and the and and other cases he told clear lies that were proven to be lies and what happened Manchin voted yes anyway he's you think that Cavanaugh is massively pro corporate anti citizen votes bothered Manchin no no that wasn't a bug that was a feature for Manchin Manchus like you're a corporate sellout well how do you do I'm corporate sellout so he voted for Kavanagh so that's how they got the fifty and that's all they needed and so Cavanaugh will now be a Supreme Court justice look there there is one day that you get to weigh in on this if you're upset today and then you don't go vote on November 6 please now use I mean Susan Collins has spare me her tears on the things that she talked about mansion and the rest of the people in Washington who cried about primary mansion when we were a hundred percent right and we just got proven right they can spare me their tears but if you're out there and you're a good progressive and you're pissed today and then you don't go vote November 6 you could also spare me your tears so either get up and do something about it or don't complain again so let's go get him man well however you do it look you whether you want to support independent media like us progressive media like us toi t.com /join go so go to find your local justice Democrat they're all uncorrupted they take no corporate PAC money and the general election is a month away you got to go get in that fight right now go to justice Democrats calm slash slate ok you can get money out of politics go to wolf dash pack.com slash join we'll put all these links down below a little bit later in the description box but for God's sake get in the fight go go down protesters great retweeting us great share this video with others that's great ok but when it comes to November 6 you have got to go vote and make sure that there are consequences for what happened today and if there aren't next time they're gonna win again and they're gonna put more incredibly right-wing justices like Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court now that is five deeply conservative justices and it is going to take decades to overcome that that's the reality and it's a unfortunately in my opinion a very sad day in America today
