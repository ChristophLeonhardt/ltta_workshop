Trump said his net worth was 8.7 billion

economy that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would suggest that kind of</font>

gyrations of net worth the reality is

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">that Donald Trump just makes it up and</font>

you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to take my word for it</font>

he's testified to that effect<font color="#E5E5E5"> but let's</font>

story that Trump was not a<font color="#CCCCCC"> billionaire</font>

13

and he denigrated that story but<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

Donald Trump now today Trump is without

22
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,120
a doubt a wealthy man but the lifestyle

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,640
he has doesn't require a billion dollars

24
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">of assets and there's no evidence that</font>

he is a billionaire what there is

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,210
evidence of is how Donald calculates his

27
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,270
wealth most of us say well I own this

28
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,520
much in the house and stock market

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,650
investments and mutual funds and other

30
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,380
property and I owe this much to the bank

31
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,979
and the difference is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my net worth or</font>

you Donald Trump his net worth is

33
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,450
determined by his emotional state he was

34
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,549
asked about this under oath just a

35
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:35,369
couple of years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and he said well it</font>

36
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:37,049
depends on how I'm feeling and the

37
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:38,759
lawyer questioning him under oath

38
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,930
pressed this and Donald went on to say

39
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:46,049
yes it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> function of how I feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now if</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">somewhere even in a fancy hotel I think</font>

00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,030
you'd quickly concludes that's nuts by

the way I'm having a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great day today I</font>

46
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">think my net worth today must be at</font>
