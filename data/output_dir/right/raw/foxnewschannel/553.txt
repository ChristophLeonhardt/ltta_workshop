1
00:00:00,571 --> 00:00:01,004
THINGS, CHAD.

2
00:00:01,004 --> 00:00:01,672
YOU GET AN "A" FOR THE DAY.

3
00:00:01,672 --> 00:00:02,273
HE’S BEEN ALL OVER THIS.

4
00:00:02,273 --> 00:00:02,907
EVERYTHING HAS TO GO LIKE

5
00:00:02,907 --> 00:00:03,541
CLOCKWORK FOR REPUBLICAN

6
00:00:03,541 --> 00:00:04,175
SENATORS HOPING TO MAKE A

7
00:00:04,175 --> 00:00:04,909
JUSTICE AND I WILL ALL STARTS ON

8
00:00:04,909 --> 00:00:05,276
THURSDAY.

9
00:00:05,276 --> 00:00:14,252
"THE FIVE" IS NOW.

10
00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:17,522
>> HELLO, EVERYONE, IT’S FIVE IN

11
00:00:17,522 --> 00:00:18,256
NEW YORK CITY AND THIS IS "THE

12
00:00:18,256 --> 00:00:27,299
FIVE."

13
00:00:27,299 --> 00:00:28,800
PRESIDENT TRUMP UNLEASHING IN

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,869
HIS FIERCEST SUPPORT YET OF HIS

15
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:32,570
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BRETT

16
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,572
KAVANAUGH.

17
00:00:33,572 --> 00:00:35,140
PRESIDENT TRUMP: I CAN TELL YOU

18
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:40,312
THAT FALSE ACCUSATION AND FALSE

19
00:00:40,312 --> 00:00:41,146
ACCUSATIONS OF ALL TYPES ARE

20
00:00:41,146 --> 00:00:43,382
MADE AGAINST A LOT OF PEOPLE.

21
00:00:43,382 --> 00:00:46,084
THIS IS A HIGH QUALITY PERSON,

22
00:00:46,084 --> 00:00:48,086
AND I CERTAINLY HOPE, I -- IT

23
00:00:48,086 --> 00:00:50,155
WOULD BE A HORRIBLE INSULT TO

24
00:00:50,155 --> 00:00:51,957
OUR COUNTRY IF THIS DOESN’T

25
00:00:51,957 --> 00:00:52,291
HAPPEN.

26
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:56,095
AND IT WILL BE A HORRIBLE,

27
00:00:56,095 --> 00:00:57,362
HORRIBLE THING FOR FUTURE

28
00:00:57,362 --> 00:00:58,230
POLITICAL PEOPLE, JUDGES,

29
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,064
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

30
00:00:59,064 --> 00:01:05,337
IT WOULD BE A HORRIBLE THING.

31
00:01:05,471 --> 00:01:06,639
AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE PLAYING A

32
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:08,674
CON GAME.

33
00:01:08,674 --> 00:01:10,042
C-O-N, A CON GAME.

34
00:01:10,042 --> 00:01:12,411
AND THEY KNOW IT’S A CON GAME.

35
00:01:12,411 --> 00:01:14,346
THE ACCUSER HAS NOTHING, SECOND

36
00:01:14,346 --> 00:01:16,348
ACCUSER DOESN’T EVEN KNOW -- SHE

37
00:01:16,348 --> 00:01:17,583
THINKS MAYBE IT COULD HAVE BEEN

38
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:19,151
HIM, MAYBE NOT.

39
00:01:19,151 --> 00:01:20,953
SHE ADMITS SHE WAS DRUNK.

40
00:01:20,953 --> 00:01:24,557
SHE ADMITS TIME LAPSES.

41
00:01:24,557 --> 00:01:25,524
HE’S STARTLED.

42
00:01:25,524 --> 00:01:26,692
HE CAN’T BELIEVE THIS IS

43
00:01:26,692 --> 00:01:27,059
HAPPENING.

44
00:01:27,059 --> 00:01:29,195
HIS WIFE IS DEVASTATED.

45
00:01:29,195 --> 00:01:31,530
HIS CHILDREN ARE DEVASTATED.

46
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,934
I DON’T MEAN THEY ARE LIKE, OH,

47
00:01:34,934 --> 00:01:38,037
GO, I’M A LITTLE UNHAPPY.

48
00:01:38,037 --> 00:01:39,205
THEY ARE DEVASTATED.

49
00:01:39,205 --> 00:01:40,273
>> MEANWHILE, SENATE DEMOCRATS

50
00:01:40,273 --> 00:01:41,607
ARE CONTINUING TO PROVE THAT THE

51
00:01:41,607 --> 00:01:44,243
FACTS DON’T MATTER WITH A NEW

52
00:01:44,243 --> 00:01:46,045
WAVE OF SUMMERS AGAINST

53
00:01:46,045 --> 00:01:46,412
KAVANAUGH.

54
00:01:46,412 --> 00:01:47,347
>> THE SECOND THING ABOUT THAT

55
00:01:47,347 --> 00:01:48,881
INTERVIEW IS WHEN HE SAID THAT

56
00:01:48,881 --> 00:01:50,583
HE ACTUALLY DOWNPLAYED HIS

57
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,151
DRINKING AND HE SAID HE NEVER

58
00:01:52,151 --> 00:01:53,453
REALLY BLACKED OUT SO HE DIDN’T

59
00:01:53,453 --> 00:01:54,053
REMEMBER THINGS.

60
00:01:54,053 --> 00:01:55,755
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT REALLY GO

61
00:01:55,755 --> 00:01:57,157
TO CREDIBILITY GIVEN SOME OF THE

62
00:01:57,157 --> 00:01:58,958
STORIES CIRCULATING OUT THERE.

63
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:00,760
>> I’VE HEARD FROM BOTH SIDES

64
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,196
AND I BELIEVE DR. BLASEY FORD,

65
00:02:03,196 --> 00:02:05,465
AND I BELIEVE MS. RAMIREZ, BOTH

66
00:02:05,465 --> 00:02:07,400
OF THEIR STORIES ARE CREDIBLE,

67
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:07,934
UNLIKE HIS.

68
00:02:07,934 --> 00:02:09,636
HE WOULDN’T ACTUALLY ANSWER THE

69
00:02:09,636 --> 00:02:11,037
QUESTION OR SAY WHY HE WOULDN’T

70
00:02:11,037 --> 00:02:12,706
BE INTERVIEWED BY THE F.B.I.

71
00:02:12,706 --> 00:02:13,773
THAT’S NOT THE RESPONSE OF

72
00:02:13,773 --> 00:02:15,709
SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO PLEAD HIS

73
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:16,076
INNOCENCE.

74
00:02:16,076 --> 00:02:19,546
>> IT IS JUDGE KAVANAUGH WHO IS

75
00:02:19,546 --> 00:02:20,680
SEEKING A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT

76
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,581
TO THE SUPREME COURT AND HE

77
00:02:21,581 --> 00:02:22,682
BEARS THE BURDEN OF DISPROVING

78
00:02:22,682 --> 00:02:23,850
THE ALLEGATIONS RATHER THAN DR.

79
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,986
FORD AND MS. RAMIREZ, WHO SHOULD

80
00:02:25,986 --> 00:02:29,690
BE DISMISSED WITH SLANDEROUS

81
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:30,123
ACCUSATIONS.

82
00:02:30,123 --> 00:02:31,291
>> DANA: GREG, I’M GOING TO

83
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,559
START WITH YOU, YOU’RE A GOOD

84
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:34,094
PLACE TO START.

85
00:02:34,094 --> 00:02:35,629
THEY ARE THROWING OUT THE

86
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:36,363
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THE

87
00:02:36,363 --> 00:02:37,231
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THAT

88
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:39,500
IS THE RIGHT OF CONFRONTATION,

89
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,703
THE RIGHT OF CROSS-EXAMINATION,

90
00:02:42,836 --> 00:02:43,203
SENATORS.

91
00:02:43,203 --> 00:02:44,204
THEY HAVE ALREADY MADE UP THEIR

92
00:02:44,204 --> 00:02:44,538
MIND.

93
00:02:44,538 --> 00:02:45,939
THEY HAVE HEARD FROM HER, THEY

94
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:47,341
HAVE HEARD FROM HIM SO WHAT’S

95
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:48,375
THE POINT OF HAVING COURTROOMS

96
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:49,710
AND TRIALS IN THIS COUNTRY.

97
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,944
SHOULDN’T WE JUST DECIDE IF WE

98
00:02:50,944 --> 00:02:52,813
LIKE SOMEONE AHEAD OF TIME?

99
00:02:52,813 --> 00:02:53,747
GREG: WHAT’S INTERESTING IS THEY

100
00:02:53,747 --> 00:02:56,383
ARE BEING HONEST ABOUT IT NOW.

101
00:02:56,383 --> 00:02:59,653
BOTH COONE AND -- BOTH HAVE

102
00:02:59,653 --> 00:03:00,688
FORMULATED A FAIRLY CHILLING

103
00:03:00,688 --> 00:03:02,890
RESPONSE WHEN YOU ASK ABOUT DUE

104
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:03,224
PROCESS.

105
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,659
THEY GO, THIS ISN’T A COURT OF

106
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:05,926
LAW.

107
00:03:05,926 --> 00:03:08,696
YOU DON’T NEED A DUE PROCESS.

108
00:03:08,696 --> 00:03:09,497
YOU KNOW WHAT?

109
00:03:09,497 --> 00:03:10,031
THEY ARE RIGHT.

110
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:11,866
THEY ARE BASICALLY ADMITTING

111
00:03:11,866 --> 00:03:14,201
THAT WE CAN CRUCIFY YOU WITHOUT

112
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:16,537
EVIDENCE OR ANY KIND OF

113
00:03:16,537 --> 00:03:17,605
CORROBORATION BECAUSE LET’S KEEP

114
00:03:17,605 --> 00:03:19,373
IT OUT OF THE COURT OF LAW AND

115
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:20,975
SO YOU LOSE -- WHAT YOU LEARN

116
00:03:20,975 --> 00:03:22,510
NOW IS YOU LOSE YOUR RIGHTS IF

117
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,545
YOU’RE UP FOR A JOB, SO MY

118
00:03:24,545 --> 00:03:26,080
SOLUTION IS EVERYBODY NEEDS TO

119
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,515
GET ACCUSATION INSURANCE BECAUSE

120
00:03:27,515 --> 00:03:28,616
RIGHT NOW, THOUGH IT’S TRUE

121
00:03:28,616 --> 00:03:30,218
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, WHAT THEY ARE

122
00:03:30,218 --> 00:03:30,852
SAYING IS.

123
00:03:30,852 --> 00:03:33,454
>> IT’S CALLED GO FUND ME.

124
00:03:33,454 --> 00:03:34,489
GREG: YOU’RE GOING TO NEED

125
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:35,690
ALLEGATION INSURANCE AND THE

126
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,159
THING IS, ONE LAST POINT, JUDGE.

127
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,627
WE AS HUMAN BEINGS WE MIMIC

128
00:03:39,627 --> 00:03:41,229
BEHAVIOR, IF YOU LOOK AT

129
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:42,964
FASHION, DIET, SOCIAL MEDIA, WE

130
00:03:42,964 --> 00:03:43,865
COPY EACH OTHER.

131
00:03:43,865 --> 00:03:45,266
THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR WILL

132
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:45,600
SPREAD.

133
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,968
THE EXCEPTION OF SIMPLY AN

134
00:03:46,968 --> 00:03:48,069
ALLEGATION MINUS EVIDENCE IS

135
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:49,371
GOING TO SPREAD INTO OTHER AREAS

136
00:03:49,371 --> 00:03:50,772
OF OUR CULTURE.

137
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:51,940
IT’S ALREADY HAPPENING.

138
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,241
YOU SEE IT IN THE WORKPLACE AND

139
00:03:53,241 --> 00:03:54,075
OTHER PLACES.

140
00:03:54,075 --> 00:03:56,177
HOW DO WE STOP IT?

141
00:03:56,177 --> 00:03:58,880
JUDGE: KENNEDY, HOW DO WE STOP

142
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,181
IT?

143
00:03:59,181 --> 00:04:00,916
WHAT WE’VE GOT IS, UNITED STATES

144
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:03,719
SENATORS SAYING THAT HE NEEDS TO

145
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:06,688
DISPROVE A NEGATIVE.

146
00:04:06,688 --> 00:04:08,657
HOW DO YOU DISPROVE OR PROVE A

147
00:04:08,657 --> 00:04:09,024
NEGATIVE?

148
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:10,425
HE’S GOT TO DISPROVE HE DID

149
00:04:10,425 --> 00:04:10,826
THIS.

150
00:04:10,826 --> 00:04:12,227
IF HE WASN’T THERE AND HE DIDN’T

151
00:04:12,227 --> 00:04:14,429
DO IT, NUMBER ONE, HOW DOES HE

152
00:04:14,429 --> 00:04:17,031
PROVE THAT?

153
00:04:17,031 --> 00:04:19,735
AND NUMBER TWO, HOW CAN UNITED

154
00:04:19,735 --> 00:04:21,737
STATES SENATORS SHIFT THE BURDEN

155
00:04:21,737 --> 00:04:22,604
OF PROOF.

156
00:04:22,604 --> 00:04:23,972
IT’S ALWAYS THE COMPLAINANT.

157
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,073
>> IT’S SMART WHAT THEY ARE

158
00:04:25,073 --> 00:04:25,707
DOING.

159
00:04:25,707 --> 00:04:26,875
THEY ARE COMING UP WITH A SERIES

160
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,577
OF DEMANDS THAT ARE ALMOST

161
00:04:28,577 --> 00:04:30,112
UNMEETABLE, AND SO ESSENTIALLY

162
00:04:30,112 --> 00:04:31,180
WHEN REPUBLICANS ON THE SENATE

163
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,982
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SAY WE CAN’T

164
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:34,883
MEET THOSE BECAUSE THEY DON’T

165
00:04:34,883 --> 00:04:37,987
MEET THE STANDARD FOR, YOU KNOW,

166
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:39,188
PROTOCOL IN THE SENATE, BUT

167
00:04:39,188 --> 00:04:41,323
ALSO, I MEAN, THAT’S HOW OUR

168
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:42,425
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, THAT’S

169
00:04:42,425 --> 00:04:45,127
WHAT IT’S BASED UPON, WHICH

170
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:46,195
ESSENTIALLY FOLLOWS FROM NATURAL

171
00:04:46,195 --> 00:04:46,462
LAW.

172
00:04:46,462 --> 00:04:48,698
SO YOU’RE TURNING ALL OF THAT ON

173
00:04:48,698 --> 00:04:51,233
ITS HEAD AND YOU CAN’T DISPROVE

174
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:52,868
A NEGATIVE.

175
00:04:52,868 --> 00:04:54,537
JUDGE: COMMON-LAW, ABSOLUTELY.

176
00:04:54,537 --> 00:04:56,105
KENNEDY IS RIGHT, JESSE BUT THEY

177
00:04:56,105 --> 00:04:59,275
ARE SAYING SHE’S NOT GETTING

178
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:00,943
FAIR AND RESPECTFUL TREATMENT.

179
00:05:00,943 --> 00:05:02,111
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

180
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:03,079
>> JESSE: I THINK DEMOCRATS HAVE

181
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,714
BEEN UNFAIR AND DISRESPECTFUL

182
00:05:04,714 --> 00:05:06,115
THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE PROCESS,

183
00:05:06,115 --> 00:05:09,419
TO KAVANAUGH WITH THE SMEARS AND

184
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:09,886
SANDBAGGING.

185
00:05:09,886 --> 00:05:10,620
LISTEN, EVERYTHING THEY HAVE

186
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,988
DONE HAS BEEN POLITICAL, THE

187
00:05:11,988 --> 00:05:14,257
TIMING, THE DEMANDS, THE

188
00:05:14,257 --> 00:05:15,158
ENTOURAGE SURROUNDING THIS

189
00:05:15,158 --> 00:05:15,592
PERSON.

190
00:05:15,592 --> 00:05:16,593
YOU KNOW WHAT THE REPUBLICANS

191
00:05:16,593 --> 00:05:16,993
SAID?

192
00:05:16,993 --> 00:05:17,927
THEY SAID OKAY.

193
00:05:17,927 --> 00:05:19,529
LET’S TAKE POLITICS OUT OF IT.

194
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:21,097
WE AREN’T GOING TO QUESTION HER.

195
00:05:21,097 --> 00:05:23,900
WE’RE GOING TO APPOINT AN

196
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,801
INDEPENDENT SEX CRIMES

197
00:05:24,801 --> 00:05:27,070
PROSECUTOR, FEMALE, WHO KNOWS

198
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,371
WHAT SHE’S TALKING ABOUT, AND

199
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:30,173
SHE’LL BE THE ONE TO ASK THE

200
00:05:30,173 --> 00:05:31,808
QUESTIONS, NOT THE POLITICIANS,

201
00:05:31,808 --> 00:05:33,176
AND THEN THE DEMOCRATS TURN

202
00:05:33,176 --> 00:05:34,544
AROUND AND SCREAM AND SAID, THIS

203
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:35,278
IS UNFAIR.

204
00:05:35,278 --> 00:05:36,813
THIS IS GOING TO CREATE A

205
00:05:36,813 --> 00:05:37,147
CIRCUS.

206
00:05:37,147 --> 00:05:38,882
THEY HAVE BEEN THE ONES CREATING

207
00:05:38,882 --> 00:05:40,884
THE CIRCUS HERE, AND THIS TYPE

208
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:43,153
OF PERSON HAS BEEN USED BEFORE.

209
00:05:43,153 --> 00:05:45,989
IN WATERGATE, IN IRAN CONTRA AS

210
00:05:45,989 --> 00:05:48,592
WELL AS MAFIA HEARINGS SO THERE

211
00:05:48,592 --> 00:05:50,794
IS NOTHING NEW TO THIS.

212
00:05:50,794 --> 00:05:52,929
JUDGE: BRINGING IN AN OUTSIDE

213
00:05:52,929 --> 00:05:53,297
ATTORNEY.

214
00:05:53,297 --> 00:05:54,164
>> THERE IS NOTHING NEW TO THIS

215
00:05:54,164 --> 00:05:55,265
AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE

216
00:05:55,265 --> 00:05:55,999
COMPLAINING BECAUSE I DON’T

217
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:57,801
BELIEVE FORD WILL LOOK GOOD

218
00:05:57,801 --> 00:05:59,636
BEING QUESTIONED BY A FEMALE

219
00:05:59,636 --> 00:06:00,871
EXPERIENCED LITIGATOR WITH THE

220
00:06:00,871 --> 00:06:01,872
STORY THAT SHE HAS.

221
00:06:01,872 --> 00:06:03,674
I THINK HER STORY WILL NOT HOLD

222
00:06:03,674 --> 00:06:05,909
UP WELL, AND THAT’S THE REASON

223
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:08,979
THE DEMOCRATS ARE UPSET ABOUT

224
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:09,279
THIS.

225
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,614
>> I HAVEN’T HEARD A WORD HERE

226
00:06:10,614 --> 00:06:12,049
THAT INDICATES -- BECAUSE THE

227
00:06:12,049 --> 00:06:14,618
JUDGE STARTED OUT BY SAYING

228
00:06:14,618 --> 00:06:16,120
DEMOCRATS ARE SMEARING JUDGE

229
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,487
KAVANAUGH.

230
00:06:16,487 --> 00:06:19,657
I HAVEN’T HEARD A WORD OF SMEAR.

231
00:06:19,657 --> 00:06:20,491
JUDGE: HE’S GUILTY.

232
00:06:20,491 --> 00:06:21,125
HE’S GUILTY.

233
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,760
THAT’S A SMEAR.

234
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,229
>> THAT’S NOT A SMEAR.

235
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:27,097
>> ATTEMPTED RAPIST, THAT’S A

236
00:06:27,097 --> 00:06:27,398
SMEAR.

237
00:06:27,398 --> 00:06:28,733
>> LET ME TALK AND THEN YOU CAN

238
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:29,166
RESPOND.

239
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:32,103
CLEARLY THIS IS NOT A COURT.

240
00:06:32,103 --> 00:06:33,804
THIS IS A SENATE CONFIRMATION

241
00:06:33,804 --> 00:06:34,572
HEARING.

242
00:06:34,572 --> 00:06:35,573
JUDGE: IT’S CONGRESS.

243
00:06:35,573 --> 00:06:36,407
>> YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

244
00:06:36,407 --> 00:06:37,975
THE JUDGE TO TESTIFY, TO SAY

245
00:06:37,975 --> 00:06:39,043
WHATEVER HE WANTS.

246
00:06:39,043 --> 00:06:45,583
NO ONE HAS HEARD FROM MS. FORD

247
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:46,651
YET.

248
00:06:46,651 --> 00:06:48,086
[TALKING AT ONCE]

249
00:06:48,086 --> 00:06:50,121
>> THE SECOND THING TO SAY HERE

250
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:51,823
IS, THEY ARE BRINGING IN A WOMAN

251
00:06:51,823 --> 00:06:55,093
LAWYER BECAUSE THEY HAVE GOT 11

252
00:06:55,093 --> 00:06:56,261
MEN ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE.

253
00:06:56,261 --> 00:06:58,730
AND THEY ARE EMBARRASSED.

254
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,299
JUDGE: THEY AREN’T EMBARRASSED.

255
00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:02,400
>> THEY CAN WIN BUT WHAT THEY

256
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,735
HAVE GOT TO DO IS THEY HAVE GOT

257
00:07:03,735 --> 00:07:05,737
TO GIVE HER A FAIR OPPORTUNITY.

258
00:07:05,737 --> 00:07:07,505
SO WHAT HER LAWYERS HAVE SAID

259
00:07:07,505 --> 00:07:08,973
IS, HEY, WAIT A SECOND.

260
00:07:08,973 --> 00:07:10,875
WE’RE NOT COMING IN HERE TO BE

261
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:14,679
BEATEN UP BY SOMEBODY WHO IS A

262
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:15,747
CRIMINAL DEFENSE INVESTIGATOR.

263
00:07:15,747 --> 00:07:18,683
YOU REFUSE TO EVEN HAVE THE

264
00:07:18,683 --> 00:07:19,885
F.B.I. INVESTIGATE.

265
00:07:19,885 --> 00:07:23,054
JUDGE: LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

266
00:07:23,054 --> 00:07:24,890
THE RULES ARE VERY SIMPLE.

267
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,291
>> BY AN EXPERIENCED PROSECUTOR.

268
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,926
>> THEY ARE THE SENATORS, WHY

269
00:07:27,926 --> 00:07:29,061
SHOULDN’T THEY DO THE

270
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:29,494
QUESTIONING?

271
00:07:29,494 --> 00:07:31,663
>> DANA: BECAUSE THEY BALKED AT

272
00:07:31,663 --> 00:07:31,930
IT.

273
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,765
>> THIS GUY WHO IS NOW HIDING

274
00:07:33,765 --> 00:07:37,569
OUT, WHO SAYS THAT HE WAS

275
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:40,038
INVOLVED WITH DRINKING

276
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:40,405
ESCAPADES.

277
00:07:40,405 --> 00:07:41,373
>> IF YOU LET ONE WITNESS COME

278
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:43,709
IN THEY WILL HAVE SEVEN, EIGHT,

279
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:45,744
OR NINE, AND THEN YOU’LL DRAW IT

280
00:07:45,744 --> 00:07:46,612
OUT UNTIL NOVEMBER.

281
00:07:46,612 --> 00:07:49,581
>> JESSE, YOU SAID A MINUTE AGO

282
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:50,716
WHY ARE THEY ARE RUSHING THIS?

283
00:07:50,716 --> 00:07:55,354
>> THE ONLY REASON WHY IT’S

284
00:07:55,354 --> 00:07:58,591
BEING RUSHED IS BECAUSE DIANNE

285
00:07:58,591 --> 00:07:59,358
FEINSTEIN DELAYED IT.

286
00:07:59,358 --> 00:08:01,026
>> IN OTHER WORDS, YOU WOULD SAY

287
00:08:01,026 --> 00:08:03,362
IGNORE THE WOMAN, ESPECIALLY

288
00:08:03,362 --> 00:08:06,498
AFTER SHE TAKES THE RISK --

289
00:08:06,498 --> 00:08:10,703
>> YOU WANT IT BOTH WAYS.

290
00:08:10,703 --> 00:08:11,937
HERE’S THE PROBLEM.

291
00:08:11,937 --> 00:08:13,706
THE QUESTIONING OF ANITA HILL

292
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:15,041
WERE SO BAD AND OFFENSIVE AND WE

293
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,342
CAN’T HAVE A REPETITION OF THAT

294
00:08:16,342 --> 00:08:17,810
IN THIS DAY AND AGE.

295
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,145
THE CULTURE HAS CHANGED.

296
00:08:19,145 --> 00:08:21,314
THE SENATE HAS CHANGED, SOCIETY

297
00:08:21,314 --> 00:08:22,615
HAS CHANGED AND WE’RE ALSO IN

298
00:08:22,615 --> 00:08:23,983
THE MIDDLE OF A MOVEMENT AND WE

299
00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:25,418
DON’T KNOW HOW THAT ENDS.

300
00:08:25,418 --> 00:08:27,019
WE DON’T KNOW HOW THAT

301
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:27,987
PERMANENTLY CHANGES SOCIETY, BUT

302
00:08:27,987 --> 00:08:30,556
IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

303
00:08:30,556 --> 00:08:33,458
PEOPLE LIKE JOE BIDEN AND ALAN

304
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,626
SPECTER GOING AFTER A FEMALE

305
00:08:34,626 --> 00:08:36,929
WITNESS OR A FEMALE ACCUSER OR

306
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:39,365
SOMEONE WHO HAS SWORN UNDER OATH

307
00:08:39,365 --> 00:08:41,567
TO TESTIFY BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE

308
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:43,570
THEN WHY NOT TRY IT DIFFERENTLY?

309
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:44,938
WHY NOT HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS NOT

310
00:08:44,938 --> 00:08:46,306
SHOW BOATING BECAUSE WHEN

311
00:08:46,306 --> 00:08:47,540
SENATORS HAVE THEIR CHANCE LIKE

312
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,476
CORY BOOKER, THIS IS MY

313
00:08:49,476 --> 00:08:51,244
SPARTACUS MOMENT, THAT’S WHEN IT

314
00:08:51,244 --> 00:08:54,447
TURNS INTO A CIRCUS AND THAT’S

315
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:55,548
WHEN PEOPLE TUNE OUT.

316
00:08:55,548 --> 00:08:57,183
BECAUSE EVERYONE IS AUDITIONING.

317
00:08:57,183 --> 00:08:59,319
>> THIS IS NOT ABOUT A

318
00:08:59,319 --> 00:08:59,819
CROSS-EXAMINATION.

319
00:08:59,819 --> 00:09:00,720
>> WHY NOT?

320
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,188
JUDGE: HOW ELSE DO WE TEST THE

321
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:03,690
TRUTH IN THIS COUNTRY?

322
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,358
>> BECAUSE YOU GIVE BOTH PEOPLE

323
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:07,194
A CHANCE TO SPEAK.

324
00:09:07,194 --> 00:09:08,695
JUDGE: HOW DO YOU DECIDE?

325
00:09:08,695 --> 00:09:09,629
>> WHETHER OR NOT IT’S A

326
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:11,131
CREDIBLE ALLEGATION AND WHETHER

327
00:09:11,131 --> 00:09:12,699
OR NOT YOU BELIEVE IT.

328
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:14,768
JUDGE: WHETHER IT’S A CIVIL CASE

329
00:09:14,768 --> 00:09:18,171
OR CRIMINAL CASE -- THIS IS EVEN

330
00:09:18,171 --> 00:09:18,905
MORE SIGNIFICANT.

331
00:09:18,905 --> 00:09:21,141
BECAUSE THIS COUNTRY IS GOING TO

332
00:09:21,141 --> 00:09:23,610
BE UNDER THE RULE OF A SUPREME

333
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,045
COURT WITH A MAN ON IT LIKE

334
00:09:25,045 --> 00:09:27,014
THIS, AND THAT’S WHY WE NEED TO

335
00:09:27,014 --> 00:09:30,451
HAVE A TEST OF TRUTH.

336
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:31,084
I’M SAYING

337
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:33,020
>> YOU JUST WANT A HARD RIGHT

338
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,520
SUPREME COURT --

339
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:38,092
>> NO, WHAT I WANT IS THE TEST

340
00:09:38,092 --> 00:09:39,026
OF CREDIBILITY.

341
00:09:39,026 --> 00:09:41,795
>> BEFORE WE GO -- JUDGE: YOU’RE

342
00:09:41,795 --> 00:09:44,865
NOT GOING TO WANT TO MISS "THE

343
00:09:44,865 --> 00:09:46,167
FIVE" TOMORROW.

344
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:48,269
>> WE’RE MISSING ONE BIG THING.

345
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:50,905
HE SAID THERE WAS NO SMEAR.

346
00:09:50,905 --> 00:09:53,474
WE HAD A GUY WHO JUST CRAWLED

347
00:09:53,474 --> 00:09:56,377
UNDER A ROCK AFTER CALLING

348
00:09:56,377 --> 00:10:01,649
KAVANAUGH AN ATTEMPTED GANG

349
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:04,251
RAPER AND MADE TWITTER PRIVATE.

350
00:10:04,251 --> 00:10:05,786
INSTEAD OF DRIVING DEEP ON A

351
00:10:05,786 --> 00:10:08,356
SPECIFIC CASE, WHAT DO YOU IS

352
00:10:08,356 --> 00:10:11,459
YOU FIND A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC

353
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,795
EXAMPLES THAT ALONE ARE NOT

354
00:10:13,795 --> 00:10:14,128
STURDY.

355
00:10:14,128 --> 00:10:17,732
ONE, FORD, TWO, RAMIREZ, THREE,

356
00:10:17,732 --> 00:10:25,406
YEARBOOK, FOUR, AVANETI’S

357
00:10:25,406 --> 00:10:27,275
CLAIMS, THE YEARBOOK, THE OTHER

358
00:10:27,275 --> 00:10:28,543
CASE HAS NO CORROBORATION, NO

359
00:10:28,543 --> 00:10:29,577
WITNESS.

360
00:10:29,577 --> 00:10:30,645
INDIVIDUALLY, THEY DON’T MATCH.

361
00:10:30,645 --> 00:10:31,479
THEY ARE NOT STRONG.

362
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:32,881
SO WHAT DO YOU IS YOU CREATE AN

363
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:34,149
ENVIRONMENT OF GUILT BY USING

364
00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:34,916
THESE LITTLE THINGS.

365
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,451
THAT’S WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE

366
00:10:36,451 --> 00:10:36,751
DOING.

367
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:38,353
IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING WITH THE

368
00:10:38,353 --> 00:10:39,888
HELP OF THE MEDIA.

369
00:10:39,888 --> 00:10:41,890
JUDGE: IT IS WORKING BECAUSE THE

370
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,159
MORE COMPLAINANTS YOU BRING IN,

371
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:45,360
THE FEWER THAT YOU HAVE TO BE

372
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,428
TESTIFIED UNDER THE RUFLS OF

373
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:58,640
CREDIBILITY THAT WE’VE USED FROM

374
