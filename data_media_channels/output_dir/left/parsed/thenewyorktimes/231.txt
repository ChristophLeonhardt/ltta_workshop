Our Milky Way galaxy
is strewn with billions
of planets, alien worlds
still unseen by human eyes —
at least for now.
Only three decades
ago we didn’t know
if there were planets
beyond our own solar system.
In 1995, astronomers
discovered that a star
in the constellation Pegasus
was wobbling back and forth,
tugged by the gravity of an
unseen planet, an exoplanet,
a hot and hellish world
unfit for life as we know it.
The wobble method
of planet hunting
relies on sensitive
spectroscopes.
As an orbiting planet tugs
on its star, the starlight
we see shifts from blue
to red and back again.
The Kepler space telescope
was launched in 2009.
It found thousands of exoplanets
by staring at a small patch
of the Milky Way.
Kepler didn’t look for wobbles.
It looked for small
dips in starlight,
when a planet crosses
in front of its star.
Kepler found systems of planets,
groups of worlds swirling
around their star, lonely
planets encased in ice,
other worlds scorched
by fire, newborn planets
shrouded in dust,
waterworlds, and planets
swept by global storms,
planets dancing in orbit
with two stars, or even
three, and even planets
from other galaxies that were
swallowed up by the Milky Way.
In recent years,
astronomers have
taken the first direct images
of exoplanets, blurry pixels
of alien landscapes.
We’ve discovered a free-floating
planet not bound to any star.
And we’ve seen signs
of planets being born,
infant worlds scoring dark rings
in the dust around their stars.
Now a new planet hunter
will join the search.
On April 16, 2018, the
Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite, or TESS, will
lift off from Cape Canaveral.
TESS will spend two years
scrutinizing the entire sky,
watching nearby
stars for minute dips
in brightness caused by
a nearby alien world.
TESS’ four cameras cover a swath
of the sky 96 degrees tall.
TESS will divide the
sky into sections
like the slices of
an orange and stare
at each section for 27 days,
then move on to the next.
After two years we will
have covered the whole sky.
TESS will fly an unusual orbit,
swooping as far out as the moon
every two weeks before
falling back close to Earth
and dumping a torrent of
data to eager astronomers.
TESS is a target hunter.
The planets it
finds can be studied
by the next generation
of telescopes on Earth
and in space.
With luck TESS will
discover worlds
suitable for lakes and
oceans, with rich atmospheres
and chemical signals
we can detect.
Their gases could tell
us whether these planets
are habitable or inhabited
by the likes of us.
The Milky Way holds more planets
than stars and a diversity
that we still haven’t
begun to plumb
In the search for life
and meaning in the cosmos,
our own world is still
the gold standard.
