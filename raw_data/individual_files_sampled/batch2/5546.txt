tomorrow is another big day for Paul Manafort special prosecutor Robert Muller has to tell a federal court in Virginia whether he intends to continue to prosecute Paul Manafort on the 10:00 verdicts that the jury could not reach an agreement on last week while the jury was busy convicting Paul Manafort on eight other counts a member of that jury revealed last week that there was only one holdout on the ten undecided counts 11 jurors were in favor of guilty and only one was in favor of not guilty on those counts prosecutors would normally continue to prosecute a case like that with a jury so heavily in their favor but Paul mana for its second trial is rapidly approaching in Washington DC where he is facing charges of obstruction of justice money laundering and failing to register as a foreign agent jury selection in that case is scheduled to begin on September 17th but today the judge delayed the beginning of the trial for one week late of the trial will now start on September 24th during Palmetto Ford's trial in Virginia congressman Devin Nunez used taxpayer money for his own trip to London where he tried to investigate the origins of the Christopher Steele dossier that describes Donald Trump's history with Russian businesses and Russian business people and in an exclusive report in the Atlantic our next guest Natasha Bertrand reports that Nunez requested meetings with the heads of three different British agencies mi5 mi6 and the government communications headquarters or GCHQ but those meetings did not pan out Nunez came away meeting only with the UK's deputy national security adviser Madeleine Ellis Andrey the people familiar with his trip told me that officials at mi6 mi5 and GCHQ were weary of entertaining Nunez out of fear that he was trying to stir up a controversy Natasha Bertrand staff writer at the Atlantic joins us now also as david korn washington bureau chief for mother jones and co-author of the book Russian roulette both our MSNBC contributors and the Trott Natasha I want to go to your exclusive reporting on what Nunez was up two on his summer break and big surprise people in London were a little suspicious of him exactly so he went over there with the intention of trying to get more information about Christopher Steele the author of the Trump Russia dossier from mi6 mi5 and GCHQ of course mi6 is the agency that Christopher still worked for for a number of decades and mi5 is the UK's domestic intelligence service and what he was trying to glean from mi5 is actually particularly interesting I'm told that he was trying to kind of figure out what they knew about Christopher Steele's relationship with Bruce or the top Justice Department official who of course was grilled today by House Republicans and who was speaking to Chris Steele throughout 2016 and 2017 kind of debriefing him on additional intelligence he may have gotten from the Trump Russia project that he was doing so go ahead so so he went over there and he requested these meetings and ultimately they did not meet with him I was told that Nunez was rebuffed behind the scenes some tell me that they just couldn't find time for him which is its own kind of snub because of course when the House Intelligence Chairman goes over to to meet with his with with high-level Intel agencies in another country you would expect them to kind of drop everything and meet with him but I was told that because of Nunez his track record in disclosing classified information and potentially compromising sources that they were wary of giving him any kind of information about Chris Steele or about the Russia investigation that they may have and David corn he also has a record that would make them very worried that he would misquote them or take something that they said and present it completely out of context back in the United States as he's done with so much information well I have first-hand evidence of that of interaction with that when he put out that infamous Nunez memo he quoted work that I had done and worked at my co-author Mike is often and got it completely wrong so you know let's just all so I mean kudos to Natasha I was very jealous when I read this story was great scoop but you know the thing here the big picture is Devin Nunez the head of the House Intelligence Committee very important job in Washington DC still continues to demonstrate to us he cares nothing about the Russian attack on the 2016 campaign he cares about Christopher steel boosts our and all these you know whacked wackadoodle conspiracy theories that would somehow protect Donald Trump you know as a guy who wrote first about steel and the dossier I think anyway I'd love to sit down with Kevin and tell him that you're completely wrong you're out to lunch stop wasting your time and do what needs to be done which is to protect our elections from further Russian intervention when we have evidence that it's still continuing it's it's it's just gotten to be absurd David you've met with Christopher steel what would you tell Devon Nunez about him if if he wanted to talk to you about I'm sure what the mi6 and mi5 guys would say if they thought it was worth speaking in Devon Nunez would say he is a respected professional he's worked 20 years with British Intel and then he worked with the FBI and other US agencies on sort of a contractor basis so people who have worked with him speak tremendously highly of him doesn't matter what my impression is he has an established track record and if you don't like what he did with it with the memos you know I don't think you can fault him he was given assignment he went out he sent stuff any didn't you know it wasn't for public consumption it was just a lot of leads and I mean it's really not much of a story I mean if we wrote a book about it but in terms of like the dark evil side of this and plotting with Bruce or personally no one ever heard of another great public servant I mean the Republicans have turned this world upside down and the only person it helps well actually there are two people it helps Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin but Natasha devil knows it's it years on this London trip as far as we know didn't find anything to help Donald Trump there's no indication that he did he was kind of fund off on the deputy national security adviser she was kind of the last one who who actually would agree to meet with him and that is what I'm told anyway but he didn't glean any kind of new information about the Steele dossier or about his relationship with Bruce or about whether the British authorities knew about that ongoing communication it's also very interesting to note though that Devon Nunez should be in theory at home with his constituents ahead of the election where he's facing a close race and instead he is off in London and before London other by Jean kind of going on these international trips which is very very weird in the middle of an election season so this just shows how his obsession with Chris Steele with undermining the Russia investigation has really it's it's it's continued and that's remarkable given all of the evidence we have that has really debunked his numerous claims throughout the last year whether it was the unmasking scandal of course which lost steam eventually and he eventually loved he launched in a parallel investigation into surveillance abuses by the Justice Department and of course as David mentioned that núñez memo in which he alleged those surveillance abuses was ultimately debunked but he continues and he has become completely fixated on this and of course the president has facilitated that and rewarded it so it's just it's really remarkable to see that he has continued down this path Natasha Bertrand
