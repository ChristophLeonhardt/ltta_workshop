hey everyone hope all is well this week

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,069
by experience an awakening of my inner

3
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:07,500
geek thanks to a game called<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pokemon go</font>

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,870
I owned pokemon blue on the Game Boy

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,410
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> 16 years ago and so this new game</font>

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,350
on smartphones has the perfect blend<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,170
nostalgia mixed in with the utilization

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the latest mainstream technological</font>

9
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,730
developments and so far is going pretty

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,650
good it has already helped boost

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,650
Nintendo's market value x<font color="#CCCCCC"> over 7.2</font>

12
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,720
billion dollars within two days of

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,880
release it has been reported<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">three percent of them are using it daily</font>

18
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,559
meaning we could see<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pokemon go have</font>

19
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,079
more daily active users than Twitter any

21
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:49,980
with the game it uses something called

AR augmented reality in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the original</font>

catch them all train them up to become

strong and battle others to become a

pokemon master<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pokemon go is an</font>

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,080
evolution because the map in this game

is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real world wherever you move your</font>

them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it takes into account your</font>

38
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,159
geographical positioning for example if

catch water pokemon although that wasn't

are dotted all across the map where you

45
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:43,619
can collect items that are needed for

catching and training<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pokemon once you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">they've created some kind of digital</font>

51
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,829
turf wars I have walked tens of

kilometers the past few days<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

53
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,030
this game whilst in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the process visiting</font>

before some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of which are right by where</font>

56
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,390
I live I mean take a look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at this April</font>

57
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,950
was when I left my<font color="#E5E5E5"> job in London and</font>

58
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,750
started working self-employed from home

59
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,000
and look at July there have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been many</font>

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,710
reports that this game has<font color="#E5E5E5"> helped p</font>

61
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,420
with mental health issues and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

62
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,000
vouch<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that myself following my head</font>

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,950
injury my fitness went down

64
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,290
significantly and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> developed episodes</font>

65
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,600
of severe anxiety when I'm undertaking

66
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,840
particular tasks work-related and

67
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,390
anxiety comes along I step away and do

68
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,580
some computer gaming instead with the

69
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">hope that this quick fix of enjoyment</font>

70
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,720
will solve<font color="#CCCCCC"> that unfortunately it doesn't</font>

71
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,000
it just postpones the anxiety so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

72
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">return to the task it's there waiting</font>

73
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,770
for me Oh high anxiety how nice to see

74
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,810
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I had to look for something else</font>

75
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do that would alleviate it and that</font>

76
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">comes with going for daily walks which</font>

77
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,040
has been amazing and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a side note</font>

78
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,740
when I do these daily walks I also post

79
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,170
a daily snapchat blog so if you're on

80
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,290
there add me miles<font color="#E5E5E5"> away 376 and hope you</font>

81
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,420
enjoy it so Pokemon go has come at a

82
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">really good time for me because it</font>

83
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">allows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me to link the enjoyment of</font>

84
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,700
playing computer games with the

85
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,830
enjoyment of going for nice long walks

86
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">every day I have seen so many people of</font>

87
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,810
all ages walking around playing it and

88
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,640
it's hard not<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get suspicious whenever</font>

89
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,170
you see someone walking<font color="#E5E5E5"> around and their</font>

90
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,270
phone now I went up to a guy the other

91
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,620
day and said excuse me man are you

92
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,300
playing game and he went what you're

93
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,010
talking about and there was a silence

94
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,790
and I went Pokemon when ah is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out yet</font>

95
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,800
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> even found myself walking through</font>

96
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,050
graveyards and forests in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the middle of</font>

97
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,030
nowhere at night playing this enough are

98
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,320
we doing out here in the middle of

99
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,320
nowhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a forest around midnight</font>

100
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,170
Pokemon I've engaged in some casual

101
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,540
trolling of my local supermarket I once

102
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,580
entered a hotel car park but in order to

103
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,680
get out I needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> a claim a token from</font>

104
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">reception that was an interesting</font>

105
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,040
conversation I've even<font color="#CCCCCC"> had some of you</font>

106
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,260
lot discover my trail just last night I

107
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,120
battled a giametta park and within

108
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,310
seconds of winning and claiming it a car

109
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,320
drove past on a road nearby and someone

110
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,990
shouted out the window mode are you did

111
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,240
and I actually caught up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> those guys</font>

112
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,390
at a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pokey stop later on and they were</font>

113
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,670
quite pleasant in person when confronted

114
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,400
for the most part I have had a vast

115
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,920
number of such amazing conversations

116
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,560
with so many pokemon players at parks

117
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,260
and pubs it's it's strange but really

118
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,870
cool some shop situated by jims and

119
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,000
polka stops are taking full advantage of

120
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,460
the

121
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,949
see and rightly so however a police

122
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:32,139
department that was situated by a pokey

123
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,270
stop had to put a notice out telling

124
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,800
players that it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible to claim it</font>

125
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,289
without actually coming inside and one

126
00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:39,729
person has the pleasure of having

127
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:41,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">Pokemon go players turn up outside his</font>

128
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:44,410
house all day and night with all the fun

129
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,210
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting stories that's not to</font>

130
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,669
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on also negative ones that have</font>

131
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:50,680
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be taken</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seriously there's a feature</font>

132
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,509
where at poker stops you can attach an

133
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:54,340
item called a lure module which makes

134
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">Pokemon spawn more frequently for the</font>

135
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:59,139
next 30 minutes and this notifies nearby

136
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:02,470
players on the map unfortunately armed

137
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,599
robbers were using this at one location

138
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:07,660
and so when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people turned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up you</font>

139
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,220
know what happened and although the game

140
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,930
does give you a warning to be aware of

141
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,970
your surroundings there are concerns

142
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,280
about people playing it while<font color="#CCCCCC"> driving or</font>

143
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,020
crossing the road people are getting

144
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,669
injured by not looking where they are

145
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:20,560
going and trespassing of course has

146
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,930
quite serious implications however<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

147
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,610
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> when a new technology becomes</font>

148
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,889
mainstream there are unfortunately going

149
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:28,690
to be negative consequences but

150
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,639
hopefully over time these will be

151
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,409
minimized and we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to consider</font>

152
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:34,900
how many pokemon go players are there in

153
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,550
the world and what percentage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those</font>

154
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,009
are falling fate to some of the stories

155
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:41,409
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we hear I personally adore this</font>

156
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:43,509
game and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I plan to spend two or three</font>

157
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">hours every night going out with my</font>

158
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:47,169
friends playing this and although there

159
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:49,180
is plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> room for improvements they</font>

160
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,250
are of course going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen this game</font>

161
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,110
can only get better<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's going to be</font>

162
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,550
