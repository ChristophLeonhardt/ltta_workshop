I DON'T WANT TO LOSE ALL OF
THAT INVESTMENT THAT THEY
HAVE MADE IN OUR COUNTRY.
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE A
MILLION JOBS.
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE
$110 BILLION IN TERMS OF THE

THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT.
WE WILL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF
IT.
>> NEW MEXICAN PRESIDENT
SAID HE WOULD LIKE TO WORK
WITH YOU ON CENTRAL AMERICAN
>> I'M REALLY LOOKING TO
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
THAT'S WHAT I DO.
I'M MAKING AMERICA GREAT
AGAIN.
WE HAVE BEEN GIVING SO MUCH
MONEY TO SO MANY DIFFERENT
COUNTRIES FOR SO LONG AND
IT'S NOT FAIR AND IT'S NOT
GOOD.
AND THEN WHEN WE ASK THEM TO
KEEP THEIR PEOPLE IN THEIR
COUNTRY, THEY ARE UNABLE TO
DO IT.
CALLED MAKE AMERICA GREAT
AGAIN.

YOU DON'T REMEMBER '16.
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG.
I HAVE NEVER SEEN SPIRIT
LIKE THE SPIRIT THAT WE HAVE

BEFORE THE RACE THE
PRESIDENTIAL RACE.
I THINK THE REPUBLICANS ARE
GOING TO DO VERY NICELY.
WE'RE DOING VERY WELL WITH
THE SENATE.

ABOUT THE RACE.
OTHER THAN TWO YEARS AGO,
THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE, I
HAVE NEVER SEEN SPIRIT LIKE

TAXES.

THEY WANTS SAFETY.
THEY WANTS SECURITY.
WE GIVE THAT TO DEMOCRATS DO
NOT GIVE THAT.
DEMOCRATS DON'T KNOW WHAT

VERY WELL IN THE RACE.
