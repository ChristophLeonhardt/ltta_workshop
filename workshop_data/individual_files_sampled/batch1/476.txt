from president eating his tie in the midst of a war to getting dragged off a roof mikhail saakashvili was once widely recognized as an advocate for reform and democracy a friend of the West an enemy of Russia Saakashvili became president of Georgia in January 2004 his popularity got him reelected four years later despite accusations of electoral fraud but Georgia's Constitution prevented him from running for a third term in 2013 Saakashvili Sparty was defeated at the polls and he left Georgia for Ukraine shortly afterwards where he supported the 2014 revolution he gained Ukrainian citizenship although it meant losing his Georgian passport Ukraine's President Petro poroshenko appointed him governor of Edessa province but he resigned in November accusing poroshenko of corruption a few days later Saakashvili announced plans to create a new political force in Ukraine but that didn't happen the government revoked his Ukrainian citizenship in July last year stateless Saakashvili was first sent to Poland then to the Netherlands where he now lives under temporary asylum status meanwhile a court in Georgia founded guilty of abuse of power in connection with a 2006 murder case he was sentenced to three years in prison sin absentee in Ukraine a prosecutor accused Saakashvili of having connections with a suspected criminal gang led by Ukraine's former President Viktor Yanukovych so where does all of this leave the man who's once hailed as a champion of democracy I'm Sam is a Dan in the Dutch capsule I've come to Amsterdam to discuss with mr. Saakashvili his rise and fall and how he plans to continue his political career former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili talks to al-jazeera former president of Georgia former governor of Odessa Ukraine thanks so much for talking to Al Jazeera sir thank you for inviting me so you're now here in the Netherlands but on April the 3rd you spoke about how you want to return to Georgia when will that happen well I think the entire region is going to change the the president artificial situation when all the guards are running the show sidelining the people sidelining democracy just making fun of the whole idea of the political process it's very artificial and then you can't return until that changes right or else you would probably buy the rest except that I also bolster the change I keep I'm the only politician maybe well maybe in the world that leads parties in two different countries I have a party which I lead in Ukraine and I have a party which I lead in Georgia and I'm in permanent contact with them indeed I spearheaded some of the campaigns there now we wish the came up with some initiative so I'm not standing still I'm not just waiting for the moment to come I'm trying to bring moment closer how do you remove oligarchs from power in places like Georgia places like Ukraine from here in the Netherlands it just can not last it is not sustainable these guys are going to collapse it's going to be a very difficult transition nothing is going to be bumpy but you know it just cannot keep going like this happens if there is a collapse in Ukraine or Georgia I mean your personal ambitions do you want to return to power and if so where because like you said you're running political parties in two countries at the same time I would not really compare myself to Simon Bolivar but I have to remind you that in other historical context that historic figure will let five Latin American countries now different situation not that kind of ambition but countries are similar challenges are similar like it used to be in the times of Simon Bolivar we need to literally live up to that expectation but how would you respond sir to those who might say you're not Simon Bolivar you've lost power twice in two different countries those who say are you able to make sound political calculations for you are absolutely right I'm not seeing Impala var and but I'm someone who is different from what happening in the inner region indeed I was I had two terms of successful presidency I finished it all and I don't criticize and look at the countries around us look at Armenia look at other neighbors look at Belarus look at you know just wherever you look these leaders extend their terms they find other ways not to quit I was the only one who had full extent of power and first of all quit had trans peaceful transition when the constitutional term expired that's quite unique which is comes natural to another place in the world in our part of the world some people think you are stupid and crazy if you do that and second you even earn more crazy according to this criteria because you know I left without any riches in about any and is stealing anything and that's also unfortunately very unusual in our part of the world and in Ukraine I left from the governorship when I felt that we were no longer in business of reforming the country rather we were staying there would be just trying to whitewash something that cannot be justified vascular optional garthok rule in your second term as georgian president there were criticisms of your tactics accusations that you try to suppress opposition protests that you had acted in a heavy-handed way do you think any of those criticisms or accusations now in hindsight are justified that you would have done things look look the georgia was a failed country you cannot make from a failed country just you know through scandinavian methods overnight something looking like Sweden or Norway Georgia has you know under my watch Georgia's economy has quadrupled the you know Georgia went from hundred 27th place of the doing business index or the World Bank to being the ninth place the best place in the world to do business that is to say we are educated corruption we became the safest country in Europe and one of the safest in the world from being one of the criminal countries do you think you fight criminal you know totally criminalize country and make transform it into the safest country in Europe just not doing anything and just being forest is sweet to the criminals and of loss of law that's rule of law but rule of law applied through zero tolerance towards crime and that's that's heart it's the opposition and the opposition ultimately won the elections and we hand it over the power we Georgia still has robust free media which all it always enjoyed under my rule and don't forget some of the propaganda against us there of course there were shortcomings but it also was imposed by very strong presence of Russian propaganda that absolutely hated me that now we know that Paul Manafort was hired by Deripaska in 2005 to write articles against us specifically on democracy and or or so-called absence of democracy starting from 2005 so we were running against a propaganda machine now we're not I'm not perfect and of course we had our mistakes but when you have the nastiest machine specifically focused on killing the idea of georgia success case not to give the soft power to the small nation that would transform the entire region then you should always understand why some of the creatures where words if the mafia and the oligarchs are still in power in georgian in ukraine but especially in georgia where you served as two terms as president why should voters believe you now when you say support my party will make sure this time will unseat the oligarchs and the mafia my reforms survived my presidency I think the biggest task for the reformers is that when you quit whether this thing is sustainable most of it is still there so from that standpoint public services you know absence of corruption safety I left good legacy and legacy is still intact from that standpoint you know we we come back basically we come back with all the experience of successes no other you know people in Georgia have turns have seen what the success looks like that's the difference when you pray in Ukraine no government since independence has demonstrated any success whatsoever and wonder if we can go back in time a little bit and talk about some of the highlights I guess this year 2018 is the tenth anniversary of the war between Georgia and Russia do you reflect back on it at all and say maybe I made a mistake in starting about war with Russia well I didn't start war with Russia in first place well that was the EU report said mber 2009 look they wrong look absolutely if somebody interprets that report there like this this is flat wrong look this is a quote for me the report found that you'd started all because of quote a penchant for acting in the heat of the moment look there is only one choice when your country gets attacked by hundred times bigger neighbor either to surrender or to fight and we chose not to surrender so hang on then the EU was wrong when they said again quote in that report of September the 30th there was no ongoing armed attack by Russia before the start of the Georgian I know your report said Russian troops were already inside our territory and if you don't call it armed attack then what the hell is the armed attack okay you know there was no armed attack in Crimea after that Josh is just came in I think they were referring to maybe the presence of Russian South Ossetia yes no but they were saying they were not an aggression are much inside the turtle just exactly the same way they were in Crimea except that Ukraine chose not to react and not to fight and Georgia chose to fight so they were telling me basically the West was playing politics with your situation when they said again in the quote of the report Georgian claims of a large-scale presence of Russian armed forces in South Ossetia prior to the Georgian offensive could not be substantially Pro were they pretending like they're always gonna be searching in ships at eight everything the only thing that they were turning blind eye on Dan because they thought this situation will not continue now we have situation when every time they have to rev the problem is the lack of leadership you know great leaders like Europe had for instance like when me Turin was there Thatcher was there you know Wilfred Montes was there lubbers was there it's gone we have just technicians in Europe we have lack of leadership in Europe nobody wants to assume responsibility as a result Putin was playing them around it's not putting about putting being so strong it's about this kind of leaders being so weak you know they're still we absolutely Europe there is no leadership in Europe of today it's exam it's so bleak and it's you know we we see you know half engagement semi engagement now fortunately at least ERISA may react it and she mobilized everybody else to react but back in 2008 that was exactly the opposite back in 2008 they would just they didn't want to hear anything about upcoming threats and you know now who is who is crazy and who is I think they were crazy when they didn't listen to me and then when they thought I was crazy and you know and the Russians were playing into that look at this crazy circus really no he's saying you're all these stupid claims and who made stupid claims now everything I learned about happened and I hate to be Cassandra but if it Europeans continue to be as weak as this we are not going to avoid big war in Europe because Russians not right now even I was at the Munich Security Conference this time generals the same generals that were downplaying Russia's being in 2008 are saying well Russia has really become dangerous let's skip forward in 2015 you decided to go to Ukraine you accept it as Ukrainian passport yes a move which you knew would mean you lose your Georgian citizenship I'm wondering why if as you said in April the 3rd of 2018 that you're committed to quote not leaving the Georgian people in despair and you want to end the room because Georgia's fate was is also decided by what happens in Ukraine I went to the region of Odessa which is extremely important strategic region do you think you could change George IDO by being the governor of vidas Odessa if Odessa would have fall would have if Odessa would have fallen Georgia would have been finished off because of the essays on the Black Sea fallen from whom the time the referendum it was when I went there it was on the brink of being fallen to the fault of the Russians it was obvious it's very it's a region with very strong separatist presence with very weak government power by that moment very precarious security situation to the point where nobody really wanted to get to go into that business of becoming Odessa governor well I I went every I want you to go there after Sara high-profile Ukrainians declined that office and because they fought order so would fall why did president Petro poroshenko ask you do you think and give you citizenship was it down to your personal relationship no I think because poroshenko before running for Ukraine president he said that his role model for reforms were two countries Singapore and Georgia under my rule and he he fought that by bringing me into Ukraine he would you know bolster his Reformers credentials into the eyes of the West and in the eyes of the Ukrainian public now what he did it what went wrong there because he wasn't serious about divorce because ultimately he had to make a choice whether to get into Ukraine's historic textbooks or to become a higher to be of a higher on the list of Forbes billionaires list he decided to get into billionaires list rather than that tax the tax books I'm wondering how you personally feel though now looking or at the time actually because this was the man who brought you to Ukraine he'd given you citizenship made you a governor and then you say you felt at some point that he wasn't living up to the reformist ideals did you feel conflicted at any point in turning against the man who yes I think it took me quite some time to to make that decision it is a hard decision to make not because of personal loyalties but plus that meeting that you know our expectations were high and we just failed to basically they failed to materialise it's hard to imagine it's hard to live through it because you know the it's not I never created I don't believe in personal loyalties of that sort and you know I never brought my family members or my classmates or anybody for that purpose in Ukraine or Georgia to to power that was never my goal yeah I oh I believe in meritocracy I believe in recruiting new people and so I never had my client poroshenko tried to in a way perish ankle maybe so me as part of his clan and obviously that was a big be misreading of what I stand for and that certain moment when he told me like just like go and fundraise that was his quote with the Ukrainian business fundraise that's to say get bribes how would you respond though to those as you know the allegations against you of being you've mentioned some of them involved in criminal activities in Ukraine those charges against you in Georgia for Miss spending public money or during the breakup of protests or during the beating up of an opposition lawmaker is even a conviction for you related to a murder look look there are there any truth to any of those allegations look first of all Freedom House just published a report saying that this is a pure political but that and that's what it is even Georgian government that basically hired ten pass retired a Western investigates to look for my offshore accounts properties villas whatever couldn't find anything it came up with ridiculous charges that every penny I spent as a president on presidential on performing presidential functions were money misspent when Georgia's economy quadrupled and basically or you know my former defense minister whom I fired for corruption testified that I ordered him to beat up somebody because the and the guy said beforehand I'll just give any testimony gates are cut really because I hate him and that's the only witness so that's why international organizations are not taking this serious that's why I'm freely moving around the world let's get forward to December 2017 when we have those very dramatic pictures of you on the rooftop of your Kiev home it's not often that you have an ex-president standing on a rooftop threatening to jump take us through the minutes and the hours that led up to that moment something like 6:00 in the morning hundreds something heavily armed security troops broke into my apartment and obviously they could have arrested me anywhere else I'm over there out without guards you know just to walk into public affair and just arrest me or all so what do you think they trying to move all that was pure intimidation to show everybody who supported us that if they could go even after me they could go after everyone so and then when they did it I needed to win time and he went were you really going to jump from now absolutely not I'm not suicidal I've never been suicidal what what happened is that know what I told them it was in a threat know what I told them if they approached me would Bob all fall because it was basically a slippery roof with but what why I went there because they gen my telephone and we need a we need time to mobilize and so I went to the roof where I could from which I could text my messages i text my message to our supporters thousands of people mobilized but it took them time to get there and in the end they freed me from police cars were you surprised when people opened the police van and managed to I was not because people knew the whole arrest was unjust later the local judge went against the system and she ruled and she suffered that she was reprimanded after that for that that it was pure kidnapping we've managed to upset a lot of authorities in Georgia Ukraine's landed me a Putin do you ever think that your personal safety might be an issue look what they were put in promised to hang me by softer parts of my body as we know this guy always when I last met him he told me you're blessed and friends give you lots of nice promises they never deliver I don't promise you anything nice but remember I always deliver I remember this words coupled with his Fred to kill me but on this from vladimir putin to you directly absolutely and then he said publicly when was this that was the february of 2008 our last meeting with him and actually and that was this is a guy who likes to do deliveries what did you understand from that did you feel like you're being i felt threatened when we came out i was less worried about personal threats towards me i thought i told my people this is his many singles with war and war happens few months later and I told the Westerners that they were Putin ministers wouldn't war and he says well you know he just menaces now the same people think that say he's just menacing he's just you know that's his way of cajoling words I have to you know have to I resigned themselves to the realities that I was right and they were wrong about worrying about Putin Putin always creates new red lines crosses them and then creates new ones now having said that it's not about me that doesn't make you a personal target though for as you say from this Vladimir Putin I'm saying according to and adviser to the French president 2018 that he will hang you by the genitalia yeah and exactly what and remember when I was asked by a journalist what I thought about it I thought I talked that you know he would not he he's not tall enough to get to me but but that's obviously not a nice thing to joke about when you hear of cases like sergey skripnikov the UK does not not make you stop and thing look III KIII ride around Amsterdam on a bike I don't have any bodyguards I was asked by Dutch police whether I needed special protection and I told them no I declined it look I I believe that whatever happens you know we I've made my impact on history of this region for sure nobody can dispute that it's Putin wants to physically get me I don't think anybody guards can protect it anyway you know every time I would pour the presidential plane in Georgia after 2008 every time we would be on there like target list of Russian air defenses system and it would show on our system so when it happens first time you know my body head of my bodyguard said what are we doing are we just driving case and know if we serve us to come to their fret they're going to paralyze us we fly even if we just wear one button pusher push away from being downed and they never push the button so you know I'm still around you thought it could have been a real possibility absolutely because putting you know look at what happened to President of Poland whatever you say but he many people including myself believe that it's connected with his support of Georgia the only worried with him coming to Tripoli see in 2008 in August of 2008 so it catch in ski or if menopause believe died because of that you can imagine that he came to support me and was the Russians no doubt would deny that I'm wondering how do you respond to the allegation that would come from the other side that says you are simply a tool of change on the part of the West look I think that's overblown I think what we have to different forces here we have on the one hand we have Russia that exports chaos in the entire region you know I'm sure that they're well first of all they generated cows in our potatoes in our part of the world they generated chaos in Syria because they want Syrian refugees to go to Europe and desta belies Europe Putin is calculating this very shrewdly I mean did you ever receive support as they say from EU or yes non-governmental organisation so on the one hand we have Russia that has very clear policy of exporting chaos and implementing on the other hand we have rather chaotic policy on the part of the West so Russia is exporting chaos and Western part very very unclear and very diligently and West is responding in a very chaotic way do you think any of these friends in the West today support you making a political comeback look not that I've been I've been asking for instruction or anybody I've been uncomfortable for many people precisely for the reasons that I have not looked for instance like Obama administration wanted me to agree was to agree to Russia's WTO membership and we've been refusing for almost two years President Obama called me sent me a letter my friend Hillary pushed very hard I said wait a minute you are a big country you solved your issues we're a small country we have small issues but until they are solved even if the President of the United States keeps me calling every day I'm not gonna do it because that's legitimate that these are our legitimate claims and in the end you know what had happened they had Russia's had to give in and so from that standpoint I have not been comfortable even for the France now I wouldn't take away those two from my values my values would like lay here where you know where whatever this the Western world is exists but on the other hand you know will I would always stand up for my national interest and that it's I'm not just easy person to be around with even for big players you know once Henry Kissinger told sarah palin Saakashvili is like a very uncomfortable player coming to poker player coming to big players table all the time without cards in his pocket well that's his vision it's not about games it's not about cards it's about your heart where it lies and it lies lies with justice and with my own nation's interest in this case two nations interests Ukraine and Georgia Georgia and Ukraine thank you very much thank you Mikhail Saakashvili talking to us thanks so much you
