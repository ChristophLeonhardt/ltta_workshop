due to some scaremongering in the media fewer Brits have actually come to this World Cup than during previous ones but as RT Zilla Petrenko found out some of them now wish they hadn't been quite so weary for parents to watch their loved ones star at the World Cup is one of the proudest moments in life so how terrified must Danny Rose have been off Russia if he said this ahead of the tournament I'm not worried for myself but I told my family I don't want them going out there because of racism and anything else that may happen well the definition of racism that I know is quite different from what the Russia World Cup guests appeared to see and feel when they got to this country and guess what after spending a bit of time in this country the three lines defender changed his mind I definitely build from now to having my family out here it's not yet clear if Danny Rose now thought so because he saw players from his team meet with their families or he just never came across issues of racism in Russia anyway let's ask the fans around here if they could tell us more about their experience did you have any problems because of your skin color nothing everyone is friendly you go to a restaurant you go to the shopping malls even if you don't know where to go just ask someone even if they don't speak proper English but they do try to tell you things nearly a petrenko RT in Kaliningrad the venue for the group G decider on Thursday and somewhere we haven't been able to find any traces of racism the Sun newspapers among those are spinning a narrative of Russia as a dangerous violent and homophobic place but their top sports presenter Martin Lipton who's right here in Russia as a bit of a different tale to tell I think the the welcome of the Russian people has been clear to everyone the organization has been superb previously I've always found Russian people somewhat more reserved than they appear to be at this at this moment open friendly people everywhere and which is great to see and also I just blown away by how brilliantly in the transport system is because the London Underground really is a disaster and this place you can get anywhere in no time at all in a much bigger city talking to my kids and my wife I'm saying to them he's fantastic it's great I think people were I said faithful they were they were put in a position where they assumed the worst where's our thing should assume the best but there you go I mean it and and and Danny's family of suffered racism in London Doncaster and whether England play whether it's in Rostov or Moscow or tomorrow or is that wherever it might be they will see a part of the world they'd never dreamed of going to and travel does broaden the mind by his very nature so that's got to be positive and they will go home with a very different image of Russia because they've experienced it that they had heretofore based on here sir it's been a real pleasure to be here and absolute joy you
