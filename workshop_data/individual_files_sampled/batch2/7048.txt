Donald Trump jr. this guy went to the premiere of Dinesh D'Souza's new propaganda orgy and he revealed himself to somehow be significantly dumber than his dad I've been out hearing the love talking about all these things fascism Nazism on the right and when you look at the actual history of how these things evolved and when you actually look at that platform versus the platform of the modern left you say wait a minute those two are really heavily aligned and frankly contrary to the right and so it's really more about just having actual real history being out there when people talk about these things you can't just spew that because someone told you that in a history class when academia and everything has been so influenced and so wrongly influenced by the left so I think it's important just to have that message out there based on actual facts based on actual history because it's just not what we've been told and I think when you look at the movie you'll see that there is a very distinct and clear difference between what actually happened and what is being sold to our youth today how is it that we could really off-ramp what's going on today sort of reduce that negativity and get back to a place where we're not trying to you know attack everyone all the time I think you just got to talk about the facts you got to talk about the history you got to look at the platform's I mean one of the most interesting things I put it out on my social last night was when I was watching the movie before this to make sure hey am i coming to something that makes sense you know you see the non-si platform in the early 1930s and what was actually put out there as it and you look at it compared to like the DNC platform up today you're saying man those things are awfully similar to a point where it's actually scary and I mean to me that was one of the most striking things I took from the movie is because it's the exact opposite of what you've been told when you you know a bunch of kids in dreadlocks were running around screaming about fascism and all these things it's like wait a second have you actually taken a history class do you actually know what these words mean that you're running around in spewing and I think they don't that ending almost broke my brain because it was just so ironic that it doesn't even compute he these kids these kids dude you were just ranting about how the Nazi platform and the current day DNC platform are like the same and you immediately followed that up with accusing other people of not knowing what they're talking about I mean he's almost like too stupid to comment on there's almost too much there that it's fucking overwhelming because you feel like you have to fact check every single goddamn second I mean holy shit is this sad I think about what he just said and for the record I find it really funny that you know people on the right they do this thing where if anybody brings up Michael Moore it's like an automatic scoff it's like Oh Michael Moore proper did and I've experienced that many times now I'm not the biggest fan of Michael Moore you know I do watch when I watch something he produces I have a skeptical eye going and I'll fact check some stuff later if I'm unsure about you know what it is so I think it's reasonable to to double check and verify and make sure but listen even if you know hey I disagree with Michael Moore let's say on 60% of stuff some of the stuff he puts out there is actually correct it's true now Dinesh D'Souza on the other hand he is he's not even the equivalent of Michael Moore on the right he is like a thousand times worse than Michael Moore his entire fucking career is based on the premise of denying the concept of a political realignment he's been making the same point for like a decade and is one point is did you know the Democrats were the Klan the Democrats were the Ku Klux Klan now I'm not going to tell you what a political realignment is and I'm not going to tell you that when Lyndon Johnson a Democrat signed the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act that there was actually a flipping of the parties and you basically had the people who identified his racist move to the Republican Party now I'm not gonna say that but what I will say is this out of context misleading fact that the Democrats were the Klan and I'll repeat that over and over and then you're gonna think that today the Klan is also democratic your summit yes of it he is relying on people who watch his stuff to not do like five seconds of googling and by the way it's probably true most of people watching stuff don't do that googling so it works I mean there's nothing more lucrative than having brown or black skin in deciding I'm just gonna tell the Republicans exactly what they want to hear every step of the way because then they just throw fucking gobs of cash at you and you're like oh shit I am cashing in bitch now I'm not saying that that's the only reason to Suze it does it because I think he actually is that stupid okay just to be clear it's not like oh I'm only making a calculation here for you know my finances no I think he actually kind of believes the his own garbage that he spews but look at the type of people I mean Donald Trump shooters cumbers Dinesh D'Souza show it's parts of a DNC platform better that are equal to the Nazi platform I mean this you know what this reminds me of it's like the fucking whole Hitler like dogs do you like dogs today oh I notice you have a dog you must be a Nazi I mean that's the level of logic that we're talking about here so what's in by the way this the current DNC platform Bernie's right it actually is the furthest left platform because of his influence and his supporters influenced so when you have a platform what you want to increase the minimum wage you know you wanna I don't know if Medicare for all's on the platform if it's not it should be I mean this is what is needed let's point out did you know that Nazi Germany actually had a government health care system yeah that wasn't the operative thing that made the Nazis the thing that made the Nazis the Nazis was oh I don't know forced sterilization of fuckin minorities taking people who have whether it be psychological issues people who were Roma people who were Jews taking these people taking away all of their rights literally sterilizing them that's how it started you know eventually going on to build concentration camps and systematically trying to do genocide and murder and wipe out entire groups of people including millions and millions of Jews yeah I think that that was the operative thing in the Nazis platform that was the problem I don't I frankly I don't give a flying fuck if if Hitler thought hey we should raise the minimum wage there's no that doesn't mean that it is by definition incorrect Hitler also had dark colored hair I have dark colored hair that doesn't mean I'm fucking Hitler so stupid it's also stupid it's also stupid uh and then also I love when the guy asks he says to to Donald Trump jr. hey how do we get to a place where you know we're not trying to all attack if where everybody's not trying to attack everyone all the time and then immediately Donald Trump jr. goes on to talk about how well obviously the Democrats are like Nazis he just said how do we get to a point where we don't attack everyone all the time see they don't they never apply the same rules to themselves they never do it they never do it there's not a hint of irony in his response there he doesn't catch that contradiction at all to them they mean oh the only thing that they're against is if some you know left-wing college kid with pink hair accuses somebody on the right of being a Nazi accuses you know his beloved daddy of being a Nazi then he's like oh I can't believe how impolite this is can you believe this why can't we can we stop attacking everybody personally please anyway can let me tell you how the Democrats or Nazis it's just it's also stupid men it's just it's also stupid that's the level of discourse and for the record in that movie you know what that Dinesh D'Souza does I'm not kidding about this he goes and talks to Richard Spencer you know the guy who's the white nationalist white supremacist and he asked rich Spencer hey who's your favorite president and he says Jackson he says Jackson he says pulk or something like that and D'Souza goes Democrats so again what did I say at the beginning of this clip Dinesh D'Souza has one trick it's been his entire it's been his entire career one-trick deny the fact that political realignments exist and they happen and so he says so he's a Democrat so in other words people took that and I'm not kidding they go on today now to say see Richard Spencer loves Democrats he's on the left again it's almost too stupid to even merit comment but yet yet again I'm here commenting on it I mean it's funny how these are the same people who also say like oh we need to get above the idea of political tribalism and picking sides you guys are the worst at that that's exactly what this is the other side are Nazis the other you're guilty of exactly what you accuse the other side of doing they're like oh all these people on the left so quick to call people racists so quick to call people Nazis and then what's he doing DNC is a lot like a lot like the Nazis the Democratic platform it's like the Nazis can we please all get along and stop calling people we disagree with Nazis you guys are like Nazis as I said almost too stupid to merit comment yet Here I am
