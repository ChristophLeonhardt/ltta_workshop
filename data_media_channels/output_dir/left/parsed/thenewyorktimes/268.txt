Hummingbirds are pure
delight, shimmering colors,
wings beating up to
80 times a second.
But there’s a furnace
beneath those feathers.
This is infrared, a glimpse of
a hummingbird’s internal heat.
Metabolism at full burn.
When a hummingbird is
hovering with its heart
beating more than
1,000 times a minute,
it burns more energy,
ounce for ounce,
than any other bird or mammal.
But wait, here’s that same bird
at night with its metabolism
slowed to a crawl.
It’s in a state called torpor.
Heartbeat and
temperature have dropped
so low that the
bird is using 1/50th
of the energy it would use
if it were zooming around
during the day.
Good thing, otherwise in
eight hours without feeding,
it could starve to death.
No wonder scientists have
long studied these birds.
Ken Welch, for one, has spent
more than a decade figuring out
how these birds manage
their energy budgets.
“I learned to become a bit of
the hummingbird whisperer.
And eventually I figured out
how to think like a hummingbird
and how to get
them to cooperate.”
Here’s how their
metabolism works.
Hummingbirds are much
better than most animals
at switching between fat and
sugar to power their muscles.
And since they feed on nectar
that is half glucose and half
fructose, they’ve evolved a way
to send that fructose directly
to their muscles to use.
Humans mainly fuel their
bodies through glucose.
For us fructose, as in
high fructose corn syrup,
goes straight to fat.
And even glucose doesn’t move
to human muscles as quickly.
But hummingbirds can
essentially mainline nectar.
In 15 minutes, their
flight muscles
are burning sugars that
they have just swallowed.
In order to study
these birds, Welch
has to train them to hover
and drink with their head
in a mask that
measures oxygen use.
The mask is a lot
like those used
on humans with a slight
difference in results.
“Their metabolic rate
when they’re hovering
is, pound for pound, 10 times
what an elite human athlete
can achieve.”
What Welch and his colleagues
have studied recently
is how size relates
to energy efficiency.
Some hummingbirds weigh
less than a penny.
Some way 10 times more,
almost a full ounce.
As you can see little birds
have to beat their wings
a lot faster to hover.
And what Welch discovered is
that the faster the wing beats,
the less efficient
the energy use.
What does it all mean?
Hummingbirds are pure delight,
both to the eye and to science.
