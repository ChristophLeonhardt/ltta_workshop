so Harvey Weinstein's wife left him I guess she realized the marriage was over when he stopped forcing her to watch him shower and then Harvey flies to Europe for treatment of sex addiction sex addiction that's the common name for it the medical the full medical name for the disease is being a soulless piece of crap with too much power I think that's what doctors call it but you have to go to Europe to get treatment for that because it's harder for them to extradite you charge you with rape I think that's why that's why the European treatment is so much better than the American treatment but there is one person in Hollywood who did something I admire maybe it wasn't a full Hollywood hero but there's one person who did something admire and I admire and I love and nobody really is talking about it even though he's a big star because of what it says about this situation everybody's saying oh the situation's about feminism and it's about this I don't think so and this

know you can't take the horse down you know put the oil or the coal and your buggy and drive down to the bow stop alright we got it you know the reason I want to keep talking about this harvey weinstein thing is not just because it's hollywood i I do think it's an important story I do think it has a lot of important things to say and I'm not gonna just be picking on Hollywood because first of all you know I've worked out here quite a lot Hollywood is not a monolithic thing it is a two overrun with liberals they've left has too much of a stranglehold on it but it's not like everybody gets together in a room in class things it's different businesses different people a lot of really nice people out here and not everybody is abusing women too plenty of religious people and good people and all this stuff but this story is amazing because this guy was king of the pack Harvey Weinstein was the king his movies are terrific these movies are excellent I think we have a question in the mailbag about that we have a lot of really good questions in the mailbag today but that's one of them I think so everybody's talking about the women coming forward how wonderful it is how heroic it is that these women are coming forward and of course they're coming forward after 20 years and and I'm not blaming them one bit you know they are not to blame the women are not to blame here but you know it it's not heroic at you know to keep quiet for twenty years and then come out Hillary Clinton finally has come out and says something she says I was shocked and appalled she sounds like he sounds like the guy in Casablanca was his name Mike you know he says I'm shocked to find gambling going on in this casino she's shocked to find sexual abuse going on in Hollywood I was shocked and appalled by the revelations about Harvey Weinstein the behavior described by women coming forward cannot be tolerated their courage in the support of others is critical in helping to stop this kind of behavior and we're gonna get to that like where is the courage here exactly and what's the problem what is the problem because there's always been there has always been powerful guys who abuse women always always always there always will be I guess I mean I think as long as there are powerful men you know guys who get to the top without any kind of consideration or morality or decency or principle they're always going to be people who VIN when they get to the top of use the people around them and especially the people under them but this is I mean Ronan Pharos peace I didn't have a time to read it all yesterday Ronan Farrow wrote this piece for The New Yorker right he says three of the women he talked to said Weinstein raped them okay not like like you know as Whoopi Goldberg who say that's rape rape right you know she said Roman Polanski wasn't rape rape you know it's like yeah no that's rape you three women said he raped me by the way I will say Weinstein has denied all of this he denies anything but he says he says the allegations include Weinstein forcibly performing or receiving oral sex and forcing vaginal sex for women said that they experienced unwanted touching that could be classified as an assault one woman said that Weinstein brought her to a hotel room under a professional pretext changed into a bathrobe and forced himself on me sexually she said no repeatedly and clearly afterwards she experienced horror disbelief and shame and considered going to the police I thought it would be a he said she said and I thought about how impressive his legal team is and I thought about how much I would lose and I decided to just move forward the woman continued to have professional contact with Weinstein after the alleged rape and acknowledged the subsequent communications between them might suggest a normal working relationship I was in a vulnerable position and I needed my job Justin creases my shame and my guilt and you know I just want to be clear because I am gonna talk about the fact that you know I don't think I think when you've kept quiet now you come forward I think that's a good thing it's a positive thing and it you know nothing but praise for the women who are coming forward and speaking out but I can't it doesn't rank as heroism to me because of course all this time went by but I just want to make it really clear that I totally understand what it means to need a job and not be able to speak out and to be up against this guy's a monolith he is you know got a legal team he's litigious he's happy to sue use happened to threaten to sue you but just just for all the people I think it was who's the guy who plays Batman now sorry I've lost Ben Affleck it was Ben Affleck who said he didn't know about this and one of the women tweeted back what do you mean you told me about it you know you told me was happening it was an open secret and Fox News just played this semi montage of people making jokes about it on 30 rock and at the Oscars this is cut number four oh please I'm not afraid of anyone in show business I turned down intercourse with Harvey Weinstein on no less than three occasions congratulations you five ladies no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein I mean that's that's a funny line from Tina Fey's show that was a really funny show but yeah I turned him enough three times out of five but it does suggest that they knew what what's going on you know the one on the Oscars a little more unclear because Harvey one scene was this gnome-like thinking he's not an attractive man at all he's a horrible burly you know ugly guy but you know so you might have made that joke about any powerful guy but the point is this was covered up Ronan Farrow the guy writes The New Yorker piece works for NBC he's a you know he's a whatever they call him a contributor to NBC he's on with Rachel Maddow and he doesn't want to bite the hand that feeds him and he starts out by saying well I don't want to say why NBC she says to him why didn't she bring this to NBC and he says well you know I don't want to bite you know say anything bad about it but listen as the interview goes on Farrah will not back down and he he won't you know cover up the fact NBC potted the story listen to this over many years many news organizations have circled this story and faced a great deal of pressure in doing so and there are now reports emerging publicly about the kinds of pressure that news organizations face in this and that is real and in the course of this reporting I was threatened with a lawsuit personally by mr. Weinstein and you know we've already seen that The Times has been publicly threatened with the suit I don't want to describe any suits leveled at other organizations that I work with but you know certainly this is a a considerable amount of pressure that outlets get us NBC says that you know you didn't that the story wasn't publishable that I wasn't ready to go by the time that you brought it to them but obviously it's ready to go by the time you got it into the New Yorker I walked into the door at The New Yorker with a an explosively reportable piece that should have been public earlier and immediately obviously The New Yorker recognized that and it is not accurate to say that it was not reportable in fact there were multiple determinations that was reportable at NBC Wow I mean wow that's what I got an explosively reportable piece then the New Yorker grabbed it he says but he had obviously gone to NBC with it first you obviously want to go be on TV instead of in The New Yorker which nobody reads and you know unless it has a piece like this and it they turned him down and he and when you know he didn't want to say it at first but when Rachel Maddow says you know they're saying it wasn't reportable the story wasn't any good he called them he called ps1 I you know so the this way this obviously happened at the times that the rap they the woman wrote that it happens at the New York Times it obviously was happening everywhere and remember Weinstein assaulted a reporter in front of other reporters and it didn't make the news I mean that this stuff was happening all the time and the reason I'm bringing this up is because as far as the women go as the victims go that this plays into it you know what do you do if they're not gonna print the story if you're gonna go up against this powerful guy who has you're you know a lot of power over you probably not just if you happen to be working for him but power to ruin your life power to make phone calls to your agent power to you know tell people not to hire you I mean you can be turned off in the SAP town that by a couple of phone calls if they just say don't if Harvey Weinstein calls and says look this woman's trouble don't hire you know she's not gonna get hired and if the press is protecting you and not just the press you know here's Barack Obama finally came out and made a statement it's a typical mealy mouthed mushy statement from Barack Obama Michelle and I have been disgusted by the recent reports about Harvey Weinstein any man who do and he put the statement out he and Kant said any man who demeans and degrades women in such fashion needs to be condemned and held accountable regardless of wealth or status we should celebrate the courage of women who have come forward to tell these painful stories and we all need to build a culture included a culture including by empowering our girls and teaching our boys decency and respect so we can make such behavior less prevalent in the future as always with Obama I think that's exactly not what we need but the point is he says he says these people need to be held accountable but here is Gabe Sherman a Vanity Fair special reporter in Vanity Fair covering all the celebs and all this stuff pointing out that even while these rumors were spread and even while anybody who knew Harvey Weinstein knew about them and like I said even I who was a screenwriter which is like basically like the lowest position you can hold in Hollywood you know even I knew that there was abuse I didn't actually know about sexual abuse and would not be something that would come my way but I certainly knew that this was an abusive guy but listen to Gabe Sherman's this is his experience of covering a speech by Barack Obama at which Harvey Weinstein a big Democrat donor was present early people did know that there were allegations of Harvey's behavior with women it was an open secret in Hollywood and immediate circles and you know I was at an event months back right after President Obama left office in which he gave a speech and the first person I was really struck by this the first person he went over to greet on the rope line was Harvey Weinstein and and and President Obama's daughter Malia in turn for him and I as a reporter sort of knowing the rumors and the gossip was shocked you know knowing what's out there that President Obama would legitimize Harvey Weinstein in that way and I think that is partly why women felt so scared to come forward because the most powerful people in the country from actors to journalists to politicians were all surrounding themselves around Harvey well well bingo right the President of the United States is moving to shake this guy's hand before anybody else or maybe former president at this point but still and you're a woman who maybe is not famous maybe he's just or maybe even is famous and knows that you can be cut down why would you know how how are you supposed to overcome that I don't I do not see I am NOT calling these women heroes because I feel like it all happens so late heroic would have been blowing the whistle and I'm really taking the heat from him it was only when his power started to ebb that people came out with this stuff but they're certainly not you know there's not to blame they're not in any way to blame and what it was what Obama said about what we need to we need to empower our girls and teach our boys decency and respect I don't think that's what we need at all because the men are key here and that's why I wanted to point out one guy one guy who at least did something he didn't do enough but he at least did something before we get to that I have to talk about policy genius because nobody wants to talk about life insurance you don't want to talk

and YouTube the mailbag is coming up but you got to come over to the daily wire.com to hear it or Yuson can subscribe for a lousy 10 bucks a month then you can be in the mailbag ask your questions and all your problems will be solved come on over to the daily wire com so it's the men I want to talk about this is what I want to get to it's the men in this story here's from the Guardian all right because this is happening now Meryl Streep Judi Dench Kate Winslet and dozens of other women in Hollywood this from the left-wing Guardian right have condemned the producer Harvey Weinstein amid a growing number of sexual harassment allegations most high-profile men in the industry however have remained silent I mean this you know when these sexual stories come out everybody likes to make them political and say I you know Bill Clinton he's on the left Roger Ailes he's on the right and all that stuff and and I'm trying not to do that because I I don't think that that I mean look the left is a little bit more sanctimonious about sexual relations and they are the feminists and they're the women's friends and all that stuff so it is a little bit what's the word ironic when it happens on the left it's a little you know just like just like they accuse us of hypocrisy when some religious guy who you know is found in a motel 6 with you know like his male masseur you know I think that that's we feel a little bit about the but my problem here the leftism that I have a problem here with is feminism because I think feminism like every other leftist policy accomplishes the exact opposite of what of what it says it's gonna do and what bothers me about the right is we're so busy being gleeful about the failures of the left that we actually adopt their values when we do it so what we say is like ha you call yourself a feminist but now these women are being abused that's not what I'm saying at all if feminism to me is a contributing factor to the crime and I will explain how in just a minute but let me finish this the Guardian contacted more than 20 male actors and directors who have worked with the movie mogul over the years some of whom have projects with Weinstein all of them declined to comment or did not respond to inquiries about the accusations that the producer sexually harassed women over a period of not nearly three decades listen to this the list of industry figures thus far remaining silent includes a number of male directors such as the oscar-nominated Quentin Tarantino and David Russell silver linings playbook who have both made numerous movies with Weinstein the liberal filmmaker Michael Moore currently working with Weinstein on a documentary about Donald Trump this is a pro this is Moore's Pro Donald Trump documentary hahaha yeah I made that up alright he also did not respond more did not respond to a request for comment to some the glaring silence from the men of Hollywood reflects a broader culture of misogyny in the entertainment business boosted by enablers who looked the other way or ignored the rumors allowing the Weinstein accusations to remain an open secret for years but it's non misogyny its feminism now let me let me be clear that before feminism plenty of powerful men abused women after feminism and in the future plenty of powerful men will abuse women but what does feminism condemn in men it condemns our superior strength being used as a protective guard for women and that is why my one hero in the story the one person I like in the story is Brad freakin Pitt Brad Pitt okay here here's the story from the New York Times when Gweneth Paltrow was 22 years old she got a roll that would take her from actress to star the film producer Harvey Weinstein hired her for the lead in Jane Austen's adaptation than the Jane Austen adaptation Emma great movie and she is absolutely I mean I always thought that Gwyneth Paltrow's she's kind of my type I've always loved Grace Kelly Peggy Lipton gwyneth paltrow I always thought was the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen I think my wife is kind of this long lean blonde you know and I think I just liked long lean blondes before shooting began Harvey summoned Gweneth Paltrow to his suite at the peninsula Beverly Hills Hotel where I've been many times for a work meeting that began uneventful II it ended with mr. Weinstein placing his hands on her and suggesting they head to the bedroom for massages she says I was a kid I was signed up I was petrified she said in an interview publicly disclosing that she was sexually harassed by the man who ignited her career and later helped her win an Academy Award and Shakespeare in Love when and by the way she says just CAA you know her agency they just sent over your schedule for today here are your business meetings and one of them was this meeting so like she had no reason to be suspicious or anything like this when mr. Weinstein tried to massage her and invited her into the bedroom she immediately left and she remembers feeling stunned as she drove away I thought you were my Uncle Harvey she recalled thinking explaining that she had seen Harvey Weinstein as a mentor as you would she told Brad Pitt about the episode and Pitts God loved him the guy thankfully we can say something good about some Priya Nollywood Brad Pitt approached mr. Weinstein at a theater premiere and this we have an actual video of what he said to him give you uh some you can't take off okay that was my dangerous that was my day drew but Brad Pitt went up to him and told him to keep his lousy hands to himself so and mr. Pitt says confirm the account to the times through a representative he gave it to him apparently because then Weinstein calls up Paltrow cuz he's too much of a wuss to take on Pitt right he huh the Paltrow and berate her for discussing the episode what hey when I'm trying to rape you you're telling people I'm not too sure exactly what he said but you know don't don't interrupt me while I'm raping you she said she also told a few friends meant family members and her agent he screamed at me for a long time Paltrow said and she once again feared she could lose the role in Emma it was brutal but she stood her ground she said and insisted that he put the relationship back on a professional footing and Paltrow went on to become she became known as the first lady of Miramax because she was in all these independent films and she was in Shakespeare in Love one of my favorite movies just an absolutely beautiful movie in which she is beautiful beyond words as far as I'm concerned but good for Brad Pitt he acted like a man I mean what we need is more guys who feel that when this happens it's their job to stop it and the people and they don't want to talk about it because it's unfeminist and I am so I'm so anti-feminist I'm so anti right-wingers who start to accuse the left oh oh you know you've betrayed feminism screw feminism you betrayed decency betrayed me humanity I hate feminism because it does this to men it makes it takes away from it it's hard to be a man it's hard to get it right it's hard to be required to stand up wit for women it's hard to be required to stand up for yourself and do the right thing on principle it's hard and so if women don't help men be men men don't have to be men and they won't do it they won't do it because why should men take the risks why should men stand a why should Brad Pitt go and risk having his career damaged by Harvey Weinstein he did it cuz he was the guy cuz she was his girlfriend and he was the guy and he did it and that to me is what this story is really a all these guys were silent now all these guys who won't answer the guardian's questions all these guys are not acting like guys they're not acting like men and standing up and that's why guys like Harvey Weinstein get around because if they get away with this because if they're in home and there's Harvey Weinstein is all there is alright now I just want to finish talking about before I go on to the mailbag I just want to say that this this is a moment when Hollywood as an industry is being exposed and Roger Simon my pal Roger Simon rights / PJ Media he's a oscar-nominated I don't think he won but he was definitely nominated for his screenwriting a really good writer and he wrote a piece today saying this is the moment for right-wing investors to start to get into the popular culture to start to buy into the popular culture when the people can see that the left wing structure that lectures and Hector's them every day from their TV screen at night that is rotten it's rotten to the core this is the time for the right to get in and Donald Trump again God love the guy have all these problems with Donald Trump but he does some really good things he has proved that if you stand up like he stood up to the NFL you can win the National Football League is now saying it will consider requiring all of its personnel to stand for the national anthem Trump is winning it's a move that could defuse the dispute with President Donald Trump but create a showdown with players over there right to protest but the thing is you know there a woman at ESPN Jamel Hill she got suspended because she said she told people to boycott advertisers if they if they left the NFL Michael Wilbon also an ESPN commentator accused the owner of the Dallas Cowboys who said he would fire people he would take people off the field if they didn't salute the flag if they didn't stand up for the flag and so he went on Wilin went on radio and he called it the plantation mentality it's a planet they were polling the race card but listen to what he says I used the phrase plantation mentality let me repeat it that's what it comes off I don't care and Terry Jones comes back and criticizes me on Fox News or anybody else you know there needs to be open discussion and sometimes it's harsh yeah and I don't have my bosses tell me what to say meaning my producer PTI I don't have anybody at Bristol tell me what to say I'm not waiting for it I'm not sitting by the phone waiting for area code eight-six Oh see this is the typical leftist thing we need to have a discussion and open discussion as if we have talked about anything else in this country for the last 50 years but certainly for the last three months we've had an open discussion you are losing the discussion that's the problem it's not that we're not having an open discussion this discussion couldn't be any more open the president is tweeting about it how open does discussion do you want you're losing the discussion they are losing the culture and it's time for us to make a move this is the time and trumpet I you know he's a guy I got a lot of problems with him a lot of his politics you know sometimes the things he does make me crazy but he's leading the way he's showing all these people you know he's all these intellectuals who just want to talk about ideas and all this stuff he's showing them there's something more important there's a passion and a love of country and a kind of visceral attachment to our traditions and our way of life that you have to have to make this stuff work and part of that comes through the culture and I think with Hollywood being exposed as being as hypocritical it is with the NFL being exposed as being completely vulnerable to the audience because they need they thought they thought they were so big no one could touch them I think this is the moment when we have to start to strike back guys with money guys with talent all those people have to start speaking out fearlessly fearlessly because that's what it's gonna take because you're gonna be called racist at every turn you're gonna be called sexist in every turn you're gonna be called a million things you have to never back down we have to push forward because this is the moment when we could win the mailbag I love her Lyndsey Lyndsey is a Halloween freak and she posted a beautiful picture she made a illustrating a song of hers called I think it's called the digger or something like this but the picture of this woman in the woods as she drew I didn't even know she didn't even know she was that town's Lenore it's really nice you can see it on her Twitter feed all right from Daniel mr. Clavin to what extent here's is the the question about Weinstein to what extent should one separate the artist from the art Roman Polanski has directed some amazing films and Harvey Weinstein has produced some of the greatest films I've ever seen I agree I don't expect artists or anyone to be a saint but is there a limit where one must cut off the artists and their work no matter how good the art is I have no limits for Emperor Clavin though well thank you I appreciate that of course and of course you know you should completely separate the artist and the art in the sense of there's no reason the only reason I would boycott a Harvey Weinstein film or film that Harvey Weinstein produced was to stop him from doing something that I felt needed to be stopped like in other words if they were gonna ignore these charges against him and not force him out now that we know about them then I would say like yeah I'm not going to your movies until you get rid of this guy I mean that would be a political action in a political moment to get at the person who was committing the crimes in the moment but his films in some sense have nothing to do with him I mean there are plenty of artists I love I'm reading all about Shelley now the poet the Romantic poet Shelley was a terrible person he's terrible things Byron was awful any awful but they wrote great poetry in the poetry is a gift you know talent is blind I mean here's the thing there's a lot of I've known a lot of artists in my life and a lot of them were bad people and the bad people always say well this one was bad and that one was bad so I can be bad too but the fact is talent is blind it lands where it will you know Eminem I'm not gonna play it but Eminem put out this really stupid video of him attacking Donald Trump Eminem who is you know one of the has some of the most hateful lyrics about women the violence also Eminem is an immensely talented guy I hate rap music but he is an immensely talented guy but that doesn't mean his art doesn't stink his art stinks it's violent and vicious SOLAS it's nasty but he has talent he has talent if he had used it for something a little better if he had used it to express something better in himself he would have written better stuff I don't really think his stuff is good enough to overcome its cruelty but if it were I would listen to it if it were I would listen to it no matter what he was doing so yeah you definitely separate it you have no isn't there there's nothing nothing sticks to you because you enjoy art assuming the art is saying something that in fact is lifting up lifting your life that's the my problem with Eminem is that he actually uses his art for bad purposes that's that's the way I feel about it but I'm not a rap fan so maybe I don't know all right from benjamin andrew has Christians we are typically taught that revenge for its own sake is a bad thing still I think people tend to view the protagonist of revenge tales as the good guys why do you think this is what in your opinion as a writer makes a revenge story so compelling well revenge it's it's justice I mean we believe in mercy Christians believe in mercy but we also believe in God's perfect justice and revenge stories give us the justice we crave in our imaginations they usually start one of the reasons I have a hard time with revenge stories they usually start with a crime so horrible is to justify the revenge I you watching the opening scene where they killed a kid or they rape the wife or something like this you know and I know it's coming and I don't want to watch it but it represents justice and there's nothing wrong with you know Stephen King once said that his books take your money you the monsters out of your brain and take them for a walk and I think that that is one of the things that art does I mean I have my own theories about art you can read about them in my book the great good thing I have my own theories about what art does but but still one of the things it certainly does is it brings out these things and it illustrates them watching you know an example that I always use as Thelma and Louise not my favorite movie in the world but in film in Louise the girls shoot a rapist after he has his hands up and he is unarmed and people go like yeah yeah whereas of course if you did that in real life you'd be charged with murder and you probably you know at least get hit for manslaughter but in the movie you get it you get that this guy has done something you know irredeemable and gets what he deserves and it gets that fantasy out there's a an element of fantasy to it and I think what you are fantasizing about is justice and in this count the story they are removing the mercy the removing the legal app applications to slow things down but I think that you have the right to fantasize about it and I think you can actually learn something and expand something about your own mind by exploring that part of yourself just don't go out and kill anybody ah from from Laurie I think Hale Clavin Hale yes a quick question in honor of the upcoming All Hallows Eve as a believer in the super or preternatural do you believe ghosts exist if so what are they if not what are people experiencing cheers for all those leftist tears I love ghosts I love ghost stories I am I love ghost stories and I'm always have to distinguish between ghost stories which are kind of eerie and creepy and horror stories which have a lot of gore and dissecting it was I really can't stand but I love ghost stories I because I love ghost stories I kind of collect them in the sense that whenever I'm in a room with ten or more people I always say has anybody ever seen a ghost and I've never been shut out I have never had ten people or more in a room and no one had seen a ghost and I have heard some really really convincing stories now when I lived in England where they're obsessed with ghosts my daughter and I used to go around and we choose hotels if we had to stay in a hotel we choose the most haunted hotel and then we'd meet in the hallways at midnight and creep around looking for ghosts never saw anything the only experience I have ever had like this at all was a couple years ago my dog died she died on Christmas Christmas Day love this dog she was exactly 15 years old I was like connected to this dog like she was my second soul and I just absolutely loved the dog and we put the dog to sleep she was in terrible pain and there was nothing we could do for her and we all came home it was me and my wife and my son and we were just looking at each other can I just said like the Sun just look at each other more oh so I'm gonna go and work out so I have out in a porch I have a elliptical machine and the Alip the porch is connected to the little patch of grass that my dog used as a bathroom right so it's a screened-in missile glass tin so I got on the elliptical machine and I am coming the dog has been dead for like an hour maybe and I'm going on the elliptical machine and suddenly the door to the that this little porch from the place that my dog used to use as her bathroom come slowly swinging in slowly I mean like somebody is pushing it in and I turned and I thought that's my dog and the door stayed open for about a minute and then it's slowly swung closed again and that's never happened before it's never happened since I have no idea what it was I have sensed her presence once we used to have a joke about my dog but she was very spiritual we'd always be one of those family jokes where he always say the same thing over and over again we'd say you know dog is God spelled backwards I was I surprised but so you asked me the question do I believe ghosts exist and you know I kind of do I let me put it to you this way the evidence that I have collected favors ghosts existing I I do believe if they exist that they are the spirits of the dead and I think that you know why they get caught here I have no idea whether they come and go or we are actually are trapped in some kind of limbo I have no idea I just have heard so many the stories I've heard have been from rational people and they have been incredibly vivid I mean some of them some of them of like oh I heard a voice like that story I just told you you could say oh the wind blew the door and or whatever some could be explained but some of them have been out of like a Christmas carol with like invisible people things like that and just like I've just heard enough to make me think that there's something there that that's all I would say there was that one here I wanted to there a couple of months jeez I'm running out of time but they're a couple I still want to answer I've heard you mentioned in interviews this is from George I've heard you mentioned in interviews most recently the Rubin report that you used to be pro-choice then you say you lost an argument with someone and changed your opinion to pro-life what was the person's argument that so influenced you I engage with pro-choice was frequently but I doubt that my arguments have changed anyone's mind I realized that whatever caused you to rethink your position will not necessarily persuade someone else but I'm wondering if there is a case I have not made well first of all it had to do with the guy I was arguing with one of my oldest friends but at the time he was not one of my oldest friends because I wasn't old enough to have oldest friends and he was a guy I really as today like and trust and admire I admire his intelligence he's always had very honest s open arguments with me he was a devout Catholic and he didn't jump on me he didn't scream at me you know it was a very civilized argument that went into the long hours and I'm a good arguer when I'm allowed to speak and debate you know but but I felt I lost the argument fair and square I mean I felt I'd lost the argument and the thing that I think most impressed me was when I made the argument that it's just a you know patch of cells a bunch of cells he very quietly laid out that this is a unique blueprint at least for an individual you know and if left alone it will develop into a full human being and that's not true before because he couldn't you know he doesn't he's a devout Catholic he doesn't believe in birth control which I do believe in very deeply and but he didn't even make that argument he didn't say he said this is different this is different once the child is there and is growing if you don't get in the way this will become a full human being and what occurred to me is he was speaking and I don't remember whether he said this or not because I was making my arguments and he was making it occurred to me that we live in time we don't just live in space right if if you go to sleep I can't come in and kill you because you're unconscious because you will eventually wake up we live in time the things that happened to me in the past affect me now I have things that bother me from the past that have changed my behavior because they happen to me we live we don't just live in the dimension of space it took me 20 years to admit to myself that I had lost the argument because it is such I was on the left and was such a what's the word a bugbear of the left you know it was kind of like one of their idols but that argument that that even though at that moment the person couldn't make a decision at that moment the person might not feel desire at that moment the person might not feel pain though that's we're not sure of that but if even so that the person that was living in time and would become a human being if left alone and that is not true before you have sex it's not true before conception but it is true afterwards it's a complete plan for a human being that will develop over time and I just I you know it's painful for me because I want women to be happy and have whatever they want and have the freedoms that they want but I just you can't kill people to get your freedom one more I got to do because it was a really good question if I can find it from Leland dear sir clay from Los Angeles I've had a crush on this girl for quite some time I only call it that because she's the first person I thought of on a non-physical basis we men often think about assets of the body before anything else but she was different the only issue is that my best friend got to her first so now while I'm still close to both of them whenever I see them both I feel something bitter boiling inside I don't believe this is envy as I have no desire to interfere with them any thoughts yes I do have thoughts on this first of all I I'm I question your description that your best friend got to her first what sounds to me is like your best friend and you're the girl that you have a crush on or in love it with fell in love they started a relationship whether he got there first or not this seems to be the relationship that she wants to have so you are in a situation where your best friend and the girl you love are together that is a painful situation so what you're feeling is pain you're feeling pain at a painful situation you will have painful situations in your life this is one of them and it's a and it's a painful one I mean I I know something about this and this is a painful painful situation your best friend and a girl that you really love are in love with each other and you're in pain so now you have the same problem that you have every day when you're not in pain or when you are in pain is which is to act with integrity and decency and for the best of all involved that's all there is to it and to live in pain I mean I can only give you the advice of Dalton from the from Roadhouse which is pain don't hurt and what that means is basically that you have to tough it out you are in pain and that just happens and you know you got to be a man about it that's that is really the answer you have got to be a man about pane and act with decency and if you can't if you can't act with decency you got to walk away you got to walk away from them and not come the other if you cannot get past the pain if it just reopens the wound every time then then you have to walk away tickety-boo news you know you know when we play the other one from the sexual Follies I don't get to see me dancing but I it is now me dancing yeah you got to put that up there so I can see it it's not fair that the audience gets entertained and I'm not I'm here to be entertained I want to be under day so tickety-boo News is not happy news it's a news about how to read the newspaper and there was this how to read the news basically and how to not get swept up in their craziness there's a picture an article by yoni Applebaum in the Atlantic Monthly is the American idea doomed and he comes out with a lot of bad news he says America no longer serves as a model for the world as it once did its influence is receding at home critics on the Left reject the notion that the US has a special role to play on the right nationalist push to define American identity around culture not principles is the American idea obsolete and he goes on to say to some extent America is a victim of its own success it's it's spread to other nations the American ideas spread to other nations has left America less distinctive than it once was it's also failed to live up to its own ideals recent reports ranked the u.s. 28th out of 35 developed countries in the percentage of adults who vote and 32nd in income equality its rates of intergenerational economic mobility are among the lowest in the developed world an opportunity to the United States now falls short it's no surprise that younger Americans have lost faith in a system that no longer seems to deliver on its promises around the globe those who dislike the American ideas about democracy now outnumber those who favor them all of this has left many Americans feeling disoriented their faith that their nation has something distinctive to offer the world has been shaken on the left many have gravitated toward a strange sort of universalism focusing on America's flaws while admiring other nation's virtues they decry now ilysm and covet open borders imagining a world in which ideas can prevail without nations to champion them many on the right now doubt that America is a land defined by a distinctive idea at all President Donald Trump's rhetoric is curiously devoid of references to a common Civic creed he promotes instead a more generic nationalism one defined like any nations by culture and borders and narrow interests and enemies both of these visions are corrosive although not equally and then he goes on to bash Trump here's what I want to say about this I agree with him that the the left side eeeh that ideas just somehow float in the ID yeah you know that's common sense is gonna make us all decent and free and there's just kind of lands on us like the gentle rain from heaven this this idea that it's not America it's not the people who've fought and died it's not our history that goes into it is absurd and I also agree that Donald Trump does not fully understand the American idea that he doesn't talk enough about the Constitution he doesn't quite understand what it is and that the people who to talk about those things hate Donald Trump and will not connect him to the to the ideas they won't help connect him to the ideas and this I think those people are wrong the intellectual right that has abandoned Donald Trump adheres why it has to do with Edmund Burke okay Edmund Burke was like kind of the founder of conservatism and Edmund Burke was a parliamentarian in England and he recognized the American Revolution and that he supported it but he attacked the French Revolution I just now reread just a couple of months ago I reread his remarks about the revolution his whole book about the revolution in France and why he thinks it's wrong and why he understood that the American Revolution was good and the French Revolution was bad has to do with the idea of tradition Burke's ideas about tradition or too often talked about as if there was some emotional thing that he just liked tradition but what he said was that if you are free if their country is free and prosperous there's every reason to believe that your traditions had something to do with that and so you should be slow to throw them away you should be slow to throw your traditions away you know that one of those letters talked about the Rubin report Dave Rubin and Dave Rubin is gay and he said to me I don't understand why you small Y small government conservatives are against gay marriage and I said while I totally uh I'm on the liberal side of this question but I totally understand it because marriage is one of the founding traditions of founding principles of our democracy of our culture and you don't just redefine it because you think it would be nice you know I understand that I mean I in this case I think I side with freedom I always side with freedom and work out the problems later but still still you know you don't throw traditions away and that's what Burke was talking about and when Donald Trump hits the NFL because they're not standing up for the flag it's important it's not right for us to turn away when when people in in Hollywood start to stand up and say well maybe men should protect women a little bit maybe men have a job to stand up for women a little bit you know that's a good thing these are traditions and when feminists sweep this stuff away when feminists say don't open the door for me but feminists say don't stand up when I come to the table they're throwing away the traditions that communicate this friendliness and this helpfulness between the sexes without which it's not going to be equality without which there's only going to be brutality and weakness that's all there's gonna be and so Donald Trump is doing something in a flawed way I acknowledge that but he's doing something important he is standing up for our traditions our visceral love of country our organic emotional love of country and our love of our traditions and they have been under attack for so long that just doing that makes him popular that just doing that makes him right and so I would say to my friends and I love these guys you know the my friends on the intellectual right who I admire so much and read and look up to you know I would just say to them you know you can't live fully in ideas these ideas live inside a temple and that temple is built on respect for the flag a temple is built for respect for our armed forces it temple is built on respect for manliness and femininity that is the temple that is built in that these ideas live inside it's not just the earth wheaten we live in it's not just the continent we live in it but it's also these traditions and Donald Trump and I acknowledge he does it in a flawed way but he does it and he does it with strength and vigor and people are responding to that and I think that it even if we that we should be supplying some of the ideas that go behind what he does because it's important he's winning these battles that we have been complaining about for years and again I will always come out and say when I think Trump does something wrong and I'll always come out and hit him for some of his ego ego and narcissism but this is so important this fight for the culture is so important because it protects the traditions that ins that protect our ideas tomorrow who's called Y think Crowder's come on I always love when crowder comes by because we he's the only time they let him out of the cage I think is when he comes to the show steven crowder will be here I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show I hope to see you then
