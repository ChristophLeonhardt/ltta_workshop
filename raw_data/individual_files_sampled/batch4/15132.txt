you know there something in your article really struck a chord with me and it was when you were talking about your mom her breaking point was using the no-name soap and you know I've spoken to other women that are very close to me and they have a similar experience it's so funny the the one woman that I know and love very much for her it's the sound of a carpet sweeper because for a time she wasn't able to have power in her house and she just wanted to vacuum like every other woman and the sound and the low look of a carpet sweeper brings it back to her and for another woman that I know it is the sound of change jingling because when she put her money into the collection plate at church everybody in the pew would know that she was poor because of the jingling of the change and you know that really struck a chord with me because it's not just aborted job it is about it it's about dignity for these family who have never taken anything yes that's exactly right and so for my family my sisters were born in the early 80s they were triplets my I was born first mum and dad tried for a boy and we wound up with four girls so my parents wound up with four kids under the age of four early 80s and just at that exact time is when Pierre Elliott Trudeau the prime minister at the time nuked the oil patch and so suddenly my dad who worked for slumber day at the time all around that era had no job to go back to he had come back here home to BC for when my sisters were born but then when he turned around to pick up that big paycheck again to go back to the oil patch and really earn that money it wasn't there and so the only thing that got us through was my mom working graveyard shifts at the local hospital as an emergency room nurse a lot of my early childhood memories are first sleeping on the couch because she'd been working all night while we were in bed and yeah it was the No Name so she just had it and I could still remember what it smelled like because she brought it home in these big bag these big plastic bags and all twelve bars were stuck together and you had to break them apart and she just lost it one day in the kitchen because it's steak it's not like metal it didn't smell like flowers or roses or vanilla or something pretty and it's things like that that really stay with you because like you said it connects back to dignity to having pride to having money to be able to cover the most basic things in life that so many of us can sometimes get away from and we can take for granted and for me as a little kid the reason why I put that in the article I remember the sound of the box something onto our porch up in the woods where we lived and they went running outside I was a little kid and there's just big cardboard box there and it was full of like donated stuff there was like an old set of rollerskates that you needed to strap to your shoes and there was an adult in there and I remember there were a pair of kind of pinkish grayish used Gumbel's and I was a little kid so I'm like hey priest yay I stuck them on my feet and I was so happy they fit but I remember the look on my mom's face and I realized that now as a wife and mother how hard that must have been and so I really wanted to reach out to those families those oil sands families those oil patch families the families who are talking right now who in some cases have bought new trucks pickups to be able to do this job they put down lease money already between here and Edmonton to be able to do this job and it just evaporated out from under them and now wanted them to know that they're not alone and that we've gone through this before and we need to fight really hard but we will get through it that's an excerpt from my daily show the Ezra lavance show weekdays at 8:00 p.m. Eastern every day I do a monologue interview a guest and read my fan mail and my hate mail to subscribe go to the rebel on media slash shows you
