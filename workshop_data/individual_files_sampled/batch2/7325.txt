News recently broke in regard to Senator John McCain's health condition if you guys can recall he was in the hospital to remove a blood clot and unfortunately through that process doctors learned that his condition was actually a lot more serious so according to reports the Mayo Clinic where McCain is being treated announced Wednesday night that doctors had discovered a form of brain cancer it's known as glioblastoma an aggressive brain cancer McCain and his family are considering treatment options which may include chemotherapy or radiation so I listen to an interview with a doctor who's you know close to this situation and he said that this is one of the most malignant forms of cancer and it's not looking good but we do know that John McCain is a fighter and he has tweeted and thanked people for their support and just showed how much of a fighter he really is he says I greatly appreciate the outpouring of support unfortunately for my sparring partners in Congress I'll be back soon so stand by so um look you might not agree with everything John McCain is done you might not agree with his voting record whatever it is doesn't matter he's a human being he's a principled human being at that you know and he has had some good moments that I'm proud of and go ahead we were talking before the show started about McCain and and I don't think any of us are particular fans of his policies and but he did serve the country and he was as you know at Hanoi Hilton he was a prisoner of war but more to the point more to Anna's point during his campaign for president you'll recall that they have one of those big townhall meetings and one of the women who was at the Town Hall stood up elderly lady and she said of this Barack Obama he's on American I think she mentioned Muslim but she was just throwing all these invectives out and and McCain shook his head no vigorously and waited for her to stop and then took the microphone said no Barack Obama is a fine American I disagree with him on policy but he's a fine America he wants to represent this country in the best way that he knows how that is the Grace and the honorable style of John McCain I missed that is that that level of civility right instead of the constant mudslinging and and when I say he's principled I really mean it because he's not necessarily someone who just wants to be loyal to his party I mean he's called Trump out he's called other Republicans out he's disagreed with other Republicans very openly and transparently and I have a lot of respect for that even if I don't agree with him on anything on everything there are some things I do agree with him on believe it or not there are few things that I agree with him on he's he's never met a war he didn't like and all of that stuff but I I agree 100% and this is a time where you know your heart breaks for him and his family and and he is a man of honor and grace and it is in very short supply right now in the political dialogue qit membership gets your commercial-free young turks downloaded streaming podcasts that get all the network shows and support independent media TYT Network comm /join
