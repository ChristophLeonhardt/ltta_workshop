>> RALLYING TONIGHT IN SUPPORT

2
00:00:14,487 --> 00:00:16,389
OF MARSHA BLACKBURN.

3
00:00:16,389 --> 00:00:18,858
PRESIDENT TRUMP WENT AFTER THE

4
00:00:18,858 --> 00:00:19,559
DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP.

5
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:20,126
WATCH THIS.

6
00:00:20,126 --> 00:00:27,500

00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,335
CHUCK SCHUMER.

8
00:00:28,335 --> 00:00:31,972
HE’S A TOOL OF CHUCK SCHUMER,

9
00:00:31,972 --> 00:00:36,610
AND OF COURSE, THE MS13 LOVER

10
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,712
NANCY PELOSI.

11
00:00:38,712 --> 00:00:41,014
I SAID THEY ARE ANIMALS, AND SHE

12
00:00:41,014 --> 00:00:44,051
SAID HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT?

13
00:00:44,051 --> 00:00:45,619
HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT?

14
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:46,987
HAVE YOU SEEN WHAT THEY HAVE

15
00:00:46,987 --> 00:00:47,387
DONE?

16
00:00:47,387 --> 00:00:48,855
HAVE YOU SEEN WHAT THEY ARE

17
00:00:48,855 --> 00:00:50,123
DOING TO US?

18
00:00:50,123 --> 00:00:51,892
AND WE ARE TAKING THEM OUT OF

19
00:00:51,892 --> 00:00:53,360
THE COUNTRY BY THE THOUSANDS.

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,929

STRATEGIST AND CONTRIBUTOR

23
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:03,971
FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT.

24
00:01:03,971 --> 00:01:06,473
THE ELECTION, I THINK IS THE

25
00:01:06,473 --> 00:01:08,075
BIGGEST MOST IMPORTANT MIDTERM.

26
00:01:08,075 --> 00:01:11,278
IT WILL BE ABOUT TAKING BACK THE

27
00:01:11,278 --> 00:01:14,915
TAX CUTS, ABOUT IMPEACHING THE

28
00:01:14,915 --> 00:01:17,318
PRESIDENT AND UNDOING AN

29
00:01:17,318 --> 00:01:21,922
ELECTION AND A LOT OF THINGS THE

30
00:01:21,922 --> 00:01:23,391
PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT TONIGHT.

31
00:01:23,391 --> 00:01:26,127
>> TONIGHT WAS A BARN STORMER.

32
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:29,764
I STARTED TICKING OFF THE THINGS

33
00:01:29,764 --> 00:01:32,199
HE COVERED, AND I RAN OUT OF

34
00:01:32,199 --> 00:01:35,536
SPACE.

35
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,674
UP FOR THE FLAG, SECOND

36
00:01:39,674 --> 00:01:42,810
AMENDMENT, REBUILDING THE

37
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,948
MILITARY, TAX CUTS, SENATE OR

38
00:01:46,948 --> 00:01:49,450
HOUSE, THIS IS THE SPEECH THAT

39
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,353
NAILED THE REPUBLICAN WAVE, NOT

40
00:01:52,353 --> 00:01:53,721
THE DEMOCRAT WAVE.

41
00:01:53,721 --> 00:01:56,524
I’M NOT GOING TO SAY BLUE WAVE.

42
00:01:56,524 --> 00:01:57,559
IT’S OUR COLOR.

43
00:01:57,559 --> 00:02:00,695
IF THERE IS ANY PARTY THAT’S

44
00:02:00,695 --> 00:02:04,666
RED, IT’S THE DEMOCRATS.

45
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,035
TONIGHT, IT’S SPECTACULAR.

46
00:02:07,035 --> 00:02:08,203
I DON’T KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE TO

47
00:02:08,203 --> 00:02:09,571
RUN ON.

48
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:12,908
BRINGING BACK ISIS?

49
00:02:12,908 --> 00:02:15,944
CUTTING YOUR TAXES?

50
00:02:15,944 --> 00:02:18,480
LETTING MORE MS13 INTO THE

51
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:18,880
COUNTRY.

52
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,648
IT WAS FABULOUS.

53
00:02:19,648 --> 00:02:22,651
>> I THINK THIS IS THE BIGGEST

54
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:24,453
ELECTION OF OUR LIFETIME.

55
00:02:24,453 --> 00:02:26,922
WE WANT TO DO IT, BUT DON’T TELL

56
00:02:26,922 --> 00:02:27,990
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

57
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,558
IT’S A LIE TO THE AMERICAN

58
00:02:29,558 --> 00:02:29,925
PEOPLE.

59
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:31,927
>> YOU ARE RIGHT, SEAN.

60
00:02:31,927 --> 00:02:34,596
IF WE LOSE THE HOUSE, THE

61
00:02:34,596 --> 00:02:36,999
PRESIDENT WILL BE IMPEACHED FOR

62
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:39,334
NOTHING, BECAUSE HE WON AN

63
00:02:39,334 --> 00:02:39,835
ELECTION.

64
00:02:39,835 --> 00:02:41,970
I THOUGHT THE LINE OF THE NIGHT

65
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,405
WAS THE MS13 LINE.

66
00:02:43,405 --> 00:02:45,874
THIS IS THE GIFT OF DONALD

67
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:46,875
TRUMP, RIGHT?

68
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,610
DONALD TRUMP GETS THE DEMOCRATS

69
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:52,181
TO SHOW THEIR BUTTS TO THE

70
00:02:52,181 --> 00:02:53,048
AMERICAN PEOPLE ALL THE TIME.

71
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:57,253
THEY GETS THEM TO DEFEND MS13,

72
00:02:57,253 --> 00:02:59,555
HAMAS AND THE NORTH KOREANS IN

73
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:01,724
THE SPAN OF THE LAST MONTH.

74
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:03,893
THAT’S YOUR DEMOCRATS OF THE

75
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,027
NICE JOB, PRESIDENT TRUMP.

76
00:03:05,027 --> 00:03:07,930
HE’S THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD

77
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,298
HAVE DONE THAT.

78
00:03:09,298 --> 00:03:12,068
THE MEDIA, IT’S LIKE A BREAKUP

79
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:12,969
LETTER.

00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:17,206
