>>  I THINK MR. TRUMP HAS
DEMONSTRATED A PARANOIA AND
INSECURITY AS WELL AS A REAL
CONCERN ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION
THAT IS UNDERWAY.
ED: FORMER CIA DIRECTOR JOHN
BRENNAN HOLDING HIMSELF UP AND
BOUND TO KEEP UP HARSH CRITICISM
OF PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYING HE
WILL SPEAK OUT UNTIL INTEGRITY
RETURNS TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
ABBY: HERE TO REACT FORMER
DEPUTY ASSISTANT TO THE
PRESIDENT AT FOX NEWS NATIONAL
SECURITY AN LIST DR. SEBASTIAN
GORKA DOCTOR ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE
YOU HERE SOUNDS LIKE DR. BRENNAN
IS SPEAKING OUT FOR A LONG TIME.
>>  WELL, UNTIL HE'S PROBABLY
CHARGED WITH BEING AT THE CENTER
OF SPYGATE.
THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS DONE
SOMETHING NO OTHER FORMER CIA
DIRECTOR HAS EVER DONE.
NOBODY HAS ATTACKED A SITTING
PRESIDENT THE WAY JOHN BRENNAN
DOES, IN A WAY THAT UNDERMINES
THE INTEGRITY OF THE CURRENT
GOVERNMENT.
HE'S ACTUALLY FEEDING INTO
RUSSIAN PROPAGANDA AND
SUPPORTING PEOPLE LIKE VLADIMIR
PUTIN WITH WHAT HE STATES, WHICH
SHOULDN'T SURPRISE ANYBODY,
BECAUSE JOHN BRENNAN HAS
ACTUALLY ADMITTED AND THIS IS A
SHOCKING THING, THAT AT THE
HEIGHT OF THE COLD WAR IN 1976,
HE VOTED FOR THE COMMUNIST PARTY
CANDIDATE FOR AMERICAN PRESIDENT
THAT'S WHEN THE SOVIET UNION WAS
TRYING TO DESTROY AMERICA.
THIS MAN HAS A TRACK RECORD
WHICH CLEARLY IS UNPATRIOTIC AND
UNAMERICAN.
ED: DOCTOR MAYBE I'M NAIVE BUT I
THOUGHT CIA DIRECTORS OF EITHER
PARTY WHETHER IT WAS SOMEBODY
NOMINATED BY PRESIDENT BUSH OR
SOMEBODY NOMINATED BY PRESIDENT
TO BE NON-PARTISAN.
>>  WELL, IT'S FUNNY YOU SHOULD
SAY THAT, ED.
ON HIS TWITTER FEED IT ACTUALLY
SAYS UNDER HIS BIO, NON-PARTISAN
, OR NEUTRAL
INDIVIDUAL.
THIS GUYS A POLITICAL HACK AND
AS SHAKESPEARE SAID, THE
PROTESTS TOO MUCH, HE IS MAKING
SO MUCH NOISE BECAUSE HE KNOWS
THAT HE'S AT THE CENTER OF
SPYGATE.
REMEMBER THAT AUSTRALIAN
AMBASSADOR, YOU REMEMBER HOW IT
ALL BEGAN, HOW THEY SENT
OPERATIVES OVERSEAS TO TALK TO
HIM?
THAT ONLY HAPPENS WITH JOHN
BRENNAN'S APPROVAL, SO THE WHOLE
DOSSIER LEADS BACK TO JOHN
BRENNAN AND THAT'S WHY HE'S
BEING SO LOUD NOW.
ED: WHEN YOU SAY PROTESTS TOO
MUCH YOU THINK THAT JOHN BRENNAN
HAS BECOME SORT OF UNHINGED
BECAUSE HE'S WORRIED THIS
INVESTIGATION IS TURNING ON HIM?
>>  ABSOLUTELY.
WE NOW KNOW THAT THIS WAS AN
INTER-AGENCY OPERATION.
IT INCLUDED THE CIA, THE FBI,
CLAPPER IS TRYING TO COVER BUT
HE'S PERJURING HIMSELF AS WELL
BUT AT THE CENTER OF ALL OF THIS
IS JOHN BRENNAN AND THAT'S WHY
HE'S BEING SO LOUD NOW AND JOHN
BRENNAN DOESN'T LAUNCH A
POLITICAL ATTACK USING THE
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AGAINST
DONALD TRUMP WITHOUT PRESIDENT
OBAMA'S APPROVAL, SO THIS IS WHY
THE MAN IS UNHINGED ED.
ABBY: QUICKLY WHAT ABOUT THE
MORALE AND DECENT IT TO ED'S
POINT HE WAS NON-PARTISAN OR
STILL CLAIMS TO BE YOU'VE GOT
35,000 OR MORE WORKING AT THE
FBI, THOUSANDS WORKING AT THE
CIA, THEY DON'T ASK WHICH
PRESIDENT THEY SERVE, THEY JUST
SERVE THE COUNTRY.
WHAT DOES THIS DO WHEN YOU HAVE
PEOPLE THAT LED THESE PLACES NOW
SPEAKING OUT SO POLITICALLY
BASICALLY PUTTING THEIR
POLITICAL OPINIONS THEIR
PERSONAL OPINIONS AGAINST THE
PRESIDENT.
>>  IT DOES THE SAME THING THAT
JAMES COMEY HAS DONE TO THE FBI.
ONE MAN MANAGES TO UNDERMINE THE
PRETIGE OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
OTHERS.
DON'T FORGET NOT ONLY WAS THIS
MAN A FORMER COMMUNIST JOHN
BRENNAN WHEN HE CAME INTO THE
CIA HE NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN
LET IN WITH THAT TRACK RECORD.
HE WANTED TO BE AN OPERATOR.
HE WANTS TO BE A CASE OFFICER.
HE FAILED AND BECAME AN ANALYST
AND SO WHEN OBAMA MADE HIM THE
DIRECTOR OF THE CIA HE TOOK HIS
REVENGE AND TRIED TO MAKE
ANALYSTS RUN OPERATIONS.
IT WAS A DISASTER AND THANK THE
GOOD LORD MIKE POMPEO TOOK OVER
AND HAS SAVED THE CIA AND NOW
HE'S DOING AN AMAZING JOB AS
SECRETARY OF STATE SO HE'S
DAMAGED THE PRETIGE BUT WE'RE
GETTING IT BACK.
