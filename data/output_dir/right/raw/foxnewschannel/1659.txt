DOESN'T FUND THE WALL.

59
00:02:14,757 --> 00:02:16,592
THE PRESIDENT WAS LED TO BELIEVE

SECURE OUR BORDER.

00:02:52,361 --> 00:02:54,997
PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTS TO SOLVE

76
00:02:54,997 --> 00:02:56,098
THE PROBLEM.

TODAY.

79
00:02:58,868 --> 00:03:00,970
>> CLEAN UP ALL OF THEIR BILLS.

80
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,005
CLEAN UP THE HILL.

81
00:03:03,005 --> 00:03:05,441
WE BELIEVE THIS BIPARTISAN BILL

82
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:07,877
THAT THE MEMBERS PUT TOGETHER

83
00:03:07,877 --> 00:03:09,311
THAT SHARE THE VALUE OF

84
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:10,112
PROTECTING THE DREAMERS IS THE

85
00:03:10,112 --> 00:03:11,414
BILL THAT WOULD WIN.

86
00:03:11,414 --> 00:03:12,948
WE HAVE AN ANSWER.

87
00:03:12,948 --> 00:03:15,451
THERE IS A TASK.

88
00:03:15,451 --> 00:03:16,652
LET'S GET IT DONE.

89
00:03:16,652 --> 00:03:19,889
IF NOT, WHY NOT?

90
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:21,290
>> Laura: EVERYONE WATCHING

91
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,892
SHOULD KNOW THAT THE 20

92
00:03:22,892 --> 00:03:25,461
REPUBLICANS PUSHING THIS

93
00:03:25,461 --> 00:03:26,629
DISCHARGE PETITION ARE WITH THE

94
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:29,698
PERSON ON THE SCREEN, NANCY

95
00:03:29,698 --> 00:03:30,032
PELOSI.

96
00:03:30,032 --> 00:03:31,967
THAT'S SHOCKING!

97
00:03:31,967 --> 00:03:34,437
40% OF AMERICANS SAY THE COUNTRY

98
00:03:34,437 --> 00:03:36,839
IS GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

99
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:38,073
IT WAS 30% A YEAR AGO.

100
00:03:38,073 --> 00:03:40,276
>> AND THAT NUMBER IS GROWING.

101
00:03:40,276 --> 00:03:41,877
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GETTING THE

102
00:03:41,877 --> 00:03:43,913
ECONOMY MOVING AGAIN.

103
00:03:43,913 --> 00:03:47,950
WORKING WITH US ON SO MANY

104
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,453
ISSUES THAT ARE MEANINGFUL.

105
00:03:50,453 --> 00:03:52,254
NANCY PELOSI SAID IF SHE WAS

106
00:03:52,254 --> 00:03:54,089
SPEAKER AGAIN SHE WOULD RAISE

107
00:03:54,089 --> 00:03:57,793
YOUR TAXES AND UNDO THE GREAT

108
00:03:57,793 --> 00:03:58,461
PRESIDENT TRUMP TAX CUTS.

109
00:03:58,461 --> 00:04:01,130
WHEN NANCY PELOSI WAS THE

110
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,567
SPEAKER, SHE NEVER TRIED TO FIX

111
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:05,401
THIS PROBLEM.

112
00:04:05,401 --> 00:04:07,136
IT WASN'T UNTIL SHE LOST THE

113
00:04:07,136 --> 00:04:09,738
MAJORITY, THAT SHE WANTED TO DO

114
00:04:09,738 --> 00:04:10,105
SOMETHING.

115
00:04:10,105 --> 00:04:11,474
THEY WANT IT AS A POLITICAL

116
00:04:11,474 --> 00:04:11,807
ISSUE.

117
00:04:11,807 --> 00:04:13,909
WE WANT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT

118
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:17,079
IN A WAY THAT RESTORES RULE OF

119
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:17,346
LAW.

120
00:04:17,346 --> 00:04:19,781
>> Laura: YOU AND MCCARTHY HAVE

121
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:21,416
HELD A TOUGH STANCE AND

122
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,118
REFLECTING THE WILL OF THE

123
00:04:23,118 --> 00:04:24,854
PEOPLE AND THE PRESIDENT'S

124
00:04:24,854 --> 00:04:27,590
AGENDA WHICH IS THE ONLY PATH

125
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,025
FORWARD FOR THE GOP AT THIS

126
00:04:30,025 --> 00:04:31,026
POINT.

127
00:04:31,026 --> 00:04:34,163
JEFF WAS ON MARTHA MacCALLUM --

128
00:04:34,163 --> 00:04:36,031
TUCKER'S SHOW, HE SAID THIS IS

129
00:04:36,031 --> 00:04:37,600
THE WAY TO DELIVER A SOLUTION TO

130
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,567
THE PRESIDENT.

131
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:39,835
THE PRESIDENT WANTS A SOLUTION.

132
00:04:39,835 --> 00:04:40,803
THIS IS THE ANSWER.

133
00:04:40,803 --> 00:04:42,671
HE SAID THERE ARE A LOT OF BILLS

134
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:44,406
THAT ARE NOT POSSIBLE BUT WE ARE

135
00:04:44,406 --> 00:04:46,475
DELIVERING A COMPREHENSIVE

136
00:04:46,475 --> 00:04:48,210
SOLUTION THAT WILL STOP THE

137
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,678
500,000 PEOPLE A YEAR CROSSING

138
00:04:49,678 --> 00:04:50,112
THE BORDER.

139
00:04:50,112 --> 00:04:53,082
>> JEFF IS A FRIEND, BUT WE

140
00:04:53,082 --> 00:04:55,117
DISAGREE STRONGLY ON.

141
00:04:55,117 --> 00:04:57,019
THIS I THINK THAT'S THE WRONG

142
00:04:57,019 --> 00:04:57,386
APPROACH.

143
00:04:57,386 --> 00:04:58,754
WE WANT TO WORK WITH PRESIDENT

144
00:04:58,754 --> 00:05:01,056
TRUMP TO FIND A SOLUTION.

145
00:05:01,056 --> 00:05:02,992
PROPOSING SOME IDEA TO BRING THE

146
00:05:02,992 --> 00:05:05,294
DREAM ACT TO THE HOUSE FLOOR AND

147
00:05:05,294 --> 00:05:07,830
PASS SOMETHING LIKE THE DREAM

148
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,232
ACT, BLANKET AMNESTY WITH NO

149
00:05:10,232 --> 00:05:11,834
BORDER SECURITY, THAT'S NOT THE

150
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:14,970
RIGHT ANSWER.

151
00:05:15,104 --> 00:05:15,704
BILL.

152
00:05:15,704 --> 00:05:18,974
WHY PURSUE AN AGENDA --

153
00:05:18,974 --> 00:05:23,679
>> Laura: WHY ARE THEY DOING IT?

154
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:26,215
>> WHY WON'T WE WORK TOGETHER?

155
00:05:26,215 --> 00:05:27,249
>> Laura: ARE THEY TRYING TO

156
00:05:27,249 --> 00:05:28,450
EMBARRASS THE PRESIDENT?

157
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,351
>> THEY COME FROM DISTRICTS

158
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:30,753
WHERE THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING

159
00:05:30,753 --> 00:05:31,120
DIFFERENT.

160
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,922
LET'S GET THE RIGHT SOLUTION

161
00:05:32,922 --> 00:05:35,391
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL SIGN.

162
00:05:35,391 --> 00:05:38,427
>> Laura: YOU ARE TOO NICE.

163
00:05:38,427 --> 00:00:00,000
I AM FROM CONNECTICUT.
