PETE: HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
BIKERS DESCENDED ON OUR NATION'S
CAPITAL TO REMEMBER OUR HEROES
WHO HAVE MADE THE ULTIMATE
SACRIFICE, AND TO HONOR THE
PRISONERS OF WAR WHO HAVE STILL
NOT COME HOME.
GRIFF: HERE NOW TO TELL US MORE
IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF
ROLLING THUNDER WHO HELPED WITH
CREATING THIS RUN, ARTIE MULLER.
ARTIE, GOOD MORNING TO YOU.
TELL US, THIS IS A RUN THAT HAS
GROWN CONSIDERABLY, AND YOU ARE
GOING TO REV THOSE ENGINES TODAY
GOING TO REV THOSE ENGINES
TODAY.
>> GOOD MORNING.
YES.
ABBY: TELL US ALL ABOUT IT.
TELL US HOW --
>> A HUGE TURNOUT AGAIN.
PETE: WHERE DOES THAT PASSION --
IT CONTINUES TO GROW, YOU'RE
HIGHLIGHTING PRISONERS OF WAR,
FOLKS MISSING IN ACTION,
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
MOTORCYCLES DESCENDING TO
WASHINGTON, D.C.
WHY ARE SO MANY SO PASSIONATE
ABOUT THIS?
>> 'CAUSE THEY'RE GOOD AMERICANS
AND THEY CARE.
THESE MEN AND WOMEN RIDE FOR THE
RIGHTS OF ALL OF US SO THAT WE
CAN LIVE FREE THE WAY WE DO, AND
OUR GOVERNMENT HAS -- THE WAR,
GETS US INVOLVED, AND LEAVES US
BEHIND AFTER A WAR, NOT ONLY OUR
COUNTRY, MANY OTHER COUNTRIES
THAT WERE LEFT BEHIND, THEIR
PEOPLE WERE LEFT BEHIND AFTER
THE WAR AND WE'RE FIGHTING ON
OUR SIDE.
GRIFF: ARTIE, YOU PENNED A
LETTER THIS YEAR TO ROLLING
THUNDER'S WEB PAGE TALKING ABOUT
THE ENVIRONMENT WE'RE IN.
SOME PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO STAND
FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM AND SOME
OTHER ISSUES.
WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE THAT YOU
WANT THE NATION TO HEAR TODAY?
>> WELL, I THINK ANYBODY DON'T
WANT TO STAND FOR OUR NATIONAL
ANTHEM SHOULD LEAVE OUR COUNTRY,
THESE BASEBALL, FOOTBALL PLAYERS
ALL THE SPORTS PLAYERS.
IF THEY CANNOT RESPECT OUR
COUNTRY, THEY SHOULD BE FINED,
AND IF THEY DO IT A COUPLE OF
TIMES, THEY SHOULD BE FIRED.
THERE'S PLENTY OF PEOPLE OUT
THERE, GOOD AMERICANS, WHO WANT
TO PLAY BALL, AND IF THEY CANNOT
RESPECT OUR FLAG, OUR COUNTRY,
OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM, WE DON'T
NEED 'EM
NEED 'EM.
ABBY: YEAH.
WELL, THE RIDE IS TODAY, ROLLING
THUNDER.
I IMAGINE THERE WILL BE AMERICAN
FLAGS EVERYWHERE.
EVERYONE WILL BE STANDING FOR
THAT ANTHEM.
JUST QUICKLY BEFORE WE LET YOU
GO, HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE COMING
OUT TODAY FOR THIS RIDE?
>> EVERYBODY STANDS FOR OUR
NATIONAL ANTHEM, EVERYBODY
