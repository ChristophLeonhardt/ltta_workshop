this pride the crazies have been out again and while it's easy to mock and laugh at some of the people who turn up at pride festivals there are some things we should actually be really concerned about the fight for respect and equality has been thoughtful or really hard but Jezebel's posting in support of a queer activist saying thank God for abortion shows just how much this movement has really changed I can only imagine what it's like for many sane minded gays who see the stuff on their screen knowing that a huge section of the population might believe that the queer insanity is standard for all gay people in a video posted on the 7th of july by Jezebel a queer activist named the Larousse talks about her campaign thank God for abortion if people with uteruses don't have access to abortion we're not having a sexual and we're all and we're past the binary now we're at Vaughn grade flute and they are making the world's first thank God for abortion a great flip she says that if people don't have access to abortion and there is no sexual liberation first of all I wasn't aware that sexual liberation was a legitimate fight right now what exactly is that nobody has banned sex and the porn industry has been doing well for years is she telling us that the next step in this political movement is the normalization of abortions and the creation of a new societal norm that considers abortion a form of contraception on par with condoms I mean regardless of your position on abortion this should concern you even many pro-choice activists understand that the decision to have an abortion is not something people make lightly or quickly a person who has an abortion knows that they are killing a growing baby inside of them and that won't ever be an easy decision to make but if we were to listen to Viva we'd be told it's simply a part of a plan for queer people to enjoy sex more freely I started doing this hashtag abortion rights a career right because why haven't those intersections like it's just not talked about that serves Viva Ruth says that the thank God for abortion movement came out of pain leading her to create the hashtag abortion rights are queer rights she asked why queer rights and abortion rights haven't been intersected yet well there's an obvious answer there but you know how the left is like for missing the blatantly obvious also Viva claims that not talking about the intersection between queer rights and abortion serves white supremacy she also proudly boasts that she has had two abortions and didn't have a bad experience with either of him astonishing I don't her first I've had to abort and that's part of the genesis of this when I had my first portion I was like this is not like what they said it was going to be I didn't see my experience in the landscape of the conversation I wanted to inject joy and the joy is about autonomy and autonomy is where we meet as a queer community like that's what it's about like I have a right to do what I want with this body suggesting that there should be joy and the autonomy of abortion is either insane or evil maybe both seeing something so emotionally traumatic and rightfully controversial being played off as normal shows just how far we've come as a society this is not a change for good this is a truly wicked agenda that strips morals away from the decisions and life we have to make and it promotes and honestly indulgent and hedonistic outlook on life I mean is this what we really want to become if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
