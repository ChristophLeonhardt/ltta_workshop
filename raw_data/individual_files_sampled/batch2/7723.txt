Steve Bannon was curiously silent about the quotes that were attributed to him in fire and fury in the days after they were initially released even before the book came out and five days later though he did speak out and he did so I believe because he was being eviscerated by the president and his surrogates and so when he spoke out he wanted Trump to know that he was really really really ridiculously sorry for the things attributed to him especially after this tweet from the president saying Michael Wolff is a total loser who made up stories in order to sell this really boring and untruthful book again he's saying it's boring because he's read it he used sloppy Steve Bannon who cried when he got fired and begged for his job now sloppy steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone too bad he says too bad but he would've fired him yeah is it too bad and also why the dog hate he always says like the dog right yeah it isn't like dogs she's dumping dogs I don't know but anyway Bannon did put out a statement and here are some sections of it I regret that my delay in responding to the inaccurate reporting regarding Don junior has diverted attention from the president's historical accomplishments in the first year of his presidency so he said there it's inaccurate reporting regarding Don junior so hold that in your mind as you read this Donald Trump jr. is both a patriot and a good man he's been relentless in his advocacy for his father in the agenda that has helped turn our country around so that's fine remember in accurate reporting he goes on to say this my comments were aimed at Paul Manafort a seasoned campaign professional with experience and knowledge of how the Russians operate he should have known their duplicity cunning and not our friends to reiterate those comments were not aimed at Don junior so were they comments that were aimed at someone else or were they inaccurately reported because it sounds like he said that about the meeting which if you've read the book you know was Don juniors idea so it's difficult to take a group of the highest up officials in the Trump campaign who go to this meeting and say one of them is treasonous and bad but the guy who set it up not treasonous because he's apparently in the words of in the implied words of Steve been and so naive or so stupid so to not know that Russian agents might attempt to pull one over on it is that what we're supposed to say from this yeah I have so many thoughts first of all I don't believe anything that Bannon is saying especially now considering his entire career is on the line there's a you know significant likelihood that he won't even be employed by Breitbart anymore because Rebecca Mercer yeah is pulling funding well not pulling funding from Breitbart but made it very clear that she is not supportive of Steve Bannon but I want to just very quickly go back to Trump's tweet and and again his tweet in my opinion just reinforces the main thesis of that book right like he tells himself all these little lies to feel good about himself the fact that he thinks the book is boring if the book is boring then it wouldn't have dominated the news cycle for what how many days now it's all anyone's really talking about and so no it's not a boring book I know that makes you feel better about yourself but that's not the case and and secondly look Bannon is so pathetic so I I didn't expect this to be honest because he presents himself as this like strong-willed you know stubborn guy who who won't kowtow to anyone and to see him tuck tail and kiss up to Trump's unlike this calling him a real American patriot it's funny and it's pathetic and it's embarrassing for Bannon and I'm enjoying every minute of it reminds me of Goodfellas reminds me of the Mafia and their names are DOM so it's like on top of that it's even better but you know you have the guy who crossed the the you know the Don the Godfather and now he comes back a sorry sorry I didn't mean to say what I was saying no no great man great man this guy's a great man you know it's the same feeling I get when and going back to Trump of course not crying any tears although there are some bad parts of this in terms of American policy that could be affected by ban him being out of the White House do if I else the idea that he was crying for his job I don't believe that he was crying for his job he just his eyes are puffy dude he's not actually crying that's a facade oh he looks but also it does seem a little bit odd I never seen Steve Boehner was very highly placed in all that he was a adviser to the president but he's being taken down for the things that he allegedly said but that book is full of every person around Donald Trump right calling him an idiot and a mole and not just that but you know attacking each other attacking his son-in-law attacking his daughter all of that it's odd that Bannon apparently is the only one who has a political price to pay for it which implies to me that it's not primarily about the book that this is just the latest reminder of the feud between Trump and Bannon I want to quickly mention this because it was evident in Steven Millers interview with Jake Tapper there was a lot of emphasis about Oh Trump accomplished all these things without Bannon without Bannon Bannon you know he wanted to take all the credit remember Trump is a very egotistical person and early on in his presidency Bannon would get a lot of credit for being the mastermind behind Trump's policy in his brain exactly and look what Ron did not like that he does not like someone else taking the credit and remember Bannon was the one that was accused of constantly leaking to the press which he very well might have done but we know that this White House has had an issue with leakers in general in including right now with Bannon gone yeah yeah and I mean look from early on there were a lot of leaks coming out if you believe what's in the book it was all of them and primarily the information about the the meeting in Trump Tower it looks like Bannon probably was one of the ones doing a lot of the leaking there and so you might wonder what so why is this important is this just I mean he's not even at the White House anymore does this really matter is it just fallout from the book but I think that it does matter because while I would love for Steve Bannon to be someone that you never needed to know the name of at least in the last couple of years he has come to represent a very loud very dark section of America his position not just with the president but with that section of America is very important for our politics going forward and if the big backers of his site go with Trump instead of him if if the alt-right decides that they prefer Trump to Bannon who used to be one of their intellectual leaders that is extremely significant so this is not for nothing that this is going on whether Trump accepts him back into the fold again so Willie it doesn't look like it from insiders it did nothing this apology to quell Trump's rage at his former chief strategist or the anger of Bennett's former West Wing colleagues who said the vibe in the president circle was that people were unmoved by the statement by the way that was just a small section it got really obsequious asked whether there's anything Bannon can do at this point to get back in the president's good graces one White House official said curtly unlikely which certainly doesn't mean impossible Trump is a person who his view of you is entirely dependent on like his last interaction with you if you say something nice about him generally he will like you and the inverse is true as well it might not have worked right now but you know this isn't the last interaction they'll have and so perhaps at some point they could make amends if you liked this video bless your heart we got a lot more where that came from we do a full show every
