BE WITH YOU TODAY.
I WILL DISCUSS RECENT ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENTS, THE OUTLOOK, AND
THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR MONETARY
POLICY.
MY MESSAGE WILL BE LARGELY
FAVORABLE, ALTHOUGH RECENT
DEVELOPMENTS HAVE BEEN MIXED.
MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE ECONOMY
HAS REGISTERED CONSIDERABLE
PROGRESS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL
YEARS TOWARDS THE FEDERAL
RESERVE'S GOALS OF MAXIMUM
EMPLOYMENT AND PRICE STABILITY.
AS I WILL EXPLAIN, THERE ARE
GOOD REASONS TO EXPECT THAT WE
WILL EXPAND FURTHER TOWARDS
THOSE GOALS.
THE NEWS FROM THE LABOR MARKET
OVER THE PAST YEAR HAS BEEN
GENERALLY GOOD.
WITH SIGNIFICANT JOB GAINS, THE
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE TO KLEIN HE
BELOW 5%, RISING HOUSEHOLD
INCOMES, AND TENTATIVE SIGNS OF
FASTER WAGE GROWTH.
AT THE SAME TIME, RECENT SIGNS
OF A SLOWDOWN IN JOB CREATION
BEAR CLOSE WATCHING.
INFLATION HAS BEEN LOWER THAN
THE OBJECTIVE OF 2%, THAT I
EXPECTED TO MOVE UP OVER TIME
FOR REASONS I WILL DESCRIBE.
IF INCOMING DATA ARE CONSISTENT
WITH LABOR MARKET CONDITIONS
STRENGTHENING, AND INFLATION
MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS THE 2%
OBJECTIVE, AS I EXPECT, FURTHER
GRADUAL INCREASES IN THE FEDERAL
FUNDS RATE ARE LIKELY TO BE
APPROPRIATE, AND MOST CONDUCIVE
TO MEETING AND MAINTAINING THOSE
OBJECTIVES.
HOWEVER, I WAS EMPHASIZED THAT
MONETARY POLICY IS NOT ON A
PRESET COURSE, AND SIGNIFICANT
SHIFTS IN THE OUTLOOK OF THE
ECONOMY WOULD NECESSITATE
CORRESPONDING SHIFTS IN THE
APPROPRIATE PATHS OF POLICY.
IN PARTICULAR, AN IMPORTANT
THEME OF MY REMARKS TODAY WILL
BE THE INEVITABLE UNCERTAINTY
SURROUNDING THE OUTLOOK FOR THE
ECONOMY.
UNFORTUNATELY, ALL ECONOMIC
PROJECTIONS ARE CERTAIN TO TURN
OUT TO BE IN BE IN ACCURATE -- 
INACCURATE IN SOME RESPECTS, AND
POSSIBLY, SIGNIFICANTLY SO.
WILL THE ECONOMIC SITUATION IN
EUROPE OR CHINA TAKE A TURN FOR
THE WORST OR EXCEED
EXPECTATIONS?
WILL U.S. PRODUCTIVITY
GROWTH PICK UP AND ALLOW A
STRONGER GROWTH OF GROSS TO MR.
PRODUCT AND INCOMES, OR WILL IT
CONTINUE TO STAGNATE?
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE PRICE OF
OIL?
THE UNCERTAINTIES ARE SIZABLE.
PROGRESS TOWARDS OUR GOALS, AND
BY LOCATION, THE APPROPRIATE
STANCE OF MONETARY POLICY, WILL
DEPEND ON HOW THESE
UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED.
INDEED, THE POLICY PATH THAT MY
COLLEAGUES AND I JUDGE AS MOST
LIKELY TO ACHIEVE A MAXIMUM
EMPLOYMENT AND PRICE STABILITY
HAS EVOLVED AND WILL CONTINUE TO
EVOLVE IN RESPONSE TO
DEVELOPMENTS THAT ALTER OUR
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND THE
ASSOCIATED RISKS.
THE ECONOMIC EXPANSION FOLLOWING
THE GREAT RECESSION HAS BEEN
UNDERWAY FOR SEVEN YEARS.
THE RECOVERY HAS NOT ALWAYS
BEEN SMOOTH, BUT OVERALL, THE
GAINS HAVE AN IMPRESSIVE, IN
PARTICULAR, THE JOB MARKET HAS
STRENGTHENED SUBSTANTIALLY.
I BELIEVE WE ARE NOW CLOSE TO
ELIMINATING THE SLACK THAT HAS
WEIGHED ON THE LABOR MARKET
SINCE THE RECESSION.
I WILL TURN TO THIS PAST FRIDAY
Y'S LABOR MARKET REPORT IN A
MOMENT.
FIRST, SOME BACKGROUND.
THE ECONOMY ADDED AN AVERAGE OF
 230,000 JOBS PER MONTH.
DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF
THIS YEAR, PAYROLLS WERE GROWING
ONLY MIRED SHIRLEY -- MODERATELY
SLOWER.
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAD FALLEN
TO A VOTE OF 5% -- BELOW 5%.
IN ADDITION, THE MEASURE OF THE
JOB OPENING RATE WAS AT A RECORD
HIGH IN MARCH, AND THE SHARE OF
EMPLOYEES VOLUNTARILY LEAVING
THEIR JOBS HAS MOVED UP.
IN MARCH, IT STOOD CLOSE TO ITS
PRE-RECESSION LEVELS.
THE INCREASE IN THE QUIT RATE
MEANS THAT WORKERS ARE FEELING
MORE CONFIDENT ABOUT THE JOB
MARKET AND LIKELY RECEIVING MORE
JOB OFFERS.
THE OVERALL SITUATION HAS BEEN
QUITE POSITIVE.
IN THAT CONTEXT, THIS PAST
FRIDAY IS LABOR MARKET REPORT
WAS DISAPPOINTING.
PAYROLL GAINS WERE REPORTED TO
BE MUCH SMALLER IN APRIL AND A
BEEN EARLIER IN THE YEAR -- THEN
EARLIER IN THE YEAR.
WHILE THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WAS
REPORTED TO HAVE FALLEN
FURTHER IN MAY, THE DECLINE OF
 OCCURRED NOT BECAUSE MORE
PEOPLE HAD JOBS, BUT FEWER
PEOPLE REPORTED THAT THEY WERE
ACTIVELY SEEKING WORK.
A BROADER MEASURE OF LABOR
MARKET SLACK THAT INCLUDES
WORKERS MARGINALLY ATTACHED TO
THE WORKFORCE AND THOSE WHO ARE
WORKING PART-TIME THAT WOULD
PREFER A FULL-TIME REMAINED
UNCHANGED.
HOWEVER, AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS
FOR ALL EMPLOYEES IN THE
NON-FOREIGN PRIVATE SECTOR
INCREASED 2.5% IN THE LAST 12
MONTHS, A BIT FASTER IN RECENT
YEARS AND A WELCOME INDICATION
THAT WAGE GROWTH MAY FINALLY BE
PICKING UP.
ALTHOUGH THE RECENT LABOR MARKET
REPORT WAS UNBALANCED, LET ME
EMPHASIZE THAT ONE SHOULD NEVER
ATTACH TOO MUCH SIGNIFICANCE TO
ANY SINGLE MONTHLY REPORT.
OTHER TIMELY INDICATORS FROM
THE LABOR MARKET HAVE BEEN MORE
POSITIVE.
FOR EXAMPLE, THE NUMBER OF
PEOPLE FILING NEW CLAIMS FOR
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE, WHICH
CAN BE GOOD EARLY INDICATOR OF
CHANGES IN LABOR MARKET
CONDITIONS REMAINS QUITE LOW.
THE PUBLIC'S PERCEPTIONS OF THE
HEALTH OF THE LABOR MARKET, AS
REPORTED IN VARIOUS CONSUMER
SURVEYS, REMAINS POSITIVE.
THAT SAID, THE MONTHLY
LABOR MARKET REPORT IS AN
IMPORTANT ECONOMIC INDICATOR.
WE WILL NEED TO WATCH LABOR
MARKET DEVELOPMENTS CAREFULLY.
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HERE IN THE
PHILADELPHIA METROPOLITAN AREA
HAVE IMPROVED BROADLY IN LINE
WITH NATIONAL TRENDS.
DURING THE DOWNTURN, THE
PHILADELPHIA AREA AND THE CITY
ITSELF SAW UNEMPLOYMENT RISE
LESS THAN IT DID FOR THE NATION
AS A WHOLE.
BUT, UNEMPLOYMENT TOOK LONGER TO
RECOVER THEREAFTER.
IN THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA IN
PARTICULAR, UNEMPLOYMENT WAS
STILL RUNNING ABOVE 10% AS
RECENTLY AS 2013.
BUT, UNEMPLOYMENT HERE HAVE
FALLEN SINCE THEN HELPED BY A
REVIVAL OF CONSTRUCTION, AS
EVIDENCED AROUND THE CITY.
WHILE THE GENERAL PICTURE OF THE
LABOR MARKET IS LARGELY
POSITIVE, SOME PEOPLE ARE STILL
STRUGGLING.
UNEMPLOYMENT RATES RAISED MORE
-- ROSE MORE DURING THE
RECESSION FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS
AND HISPANICS THAN FOR THE
NATION OVERALL.
EVEN THOSE THOSE RATES HAVE ALSO
COME DOWN BY MORE DURING THE
ECONOMIC EXPANSION, UNEMPLOYMENT
REMAINS HIGHER FOR THESE GROUPS.
UNFORTUNATELY, THOSE GAPS HAVE
NOT NARROWED NOTICEABLY
RELATIVE TO WHERE THEY WERE
BEFORE THE RECESSION.
UNEMPLOYMENT RATES FOR YOUNG
AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND HISPANIC
MEN WITHOUT A COLLEGE DEGREE
REMAIN ESPECIALLY HIGH.
ONE IMPORTANT AND IF IT FROM
FURTHER IMPROVEMENT IN THE LABOR
MARKET WOULD BE INCREASED JOB
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THESE MEN AND
OTHER GROUPS THAT CURRENTLY
STILL EXPERIENCE HIGH
UNEMPLOYMENT.
TO BE SURE, MANY OF THE FACTORS
THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE LABOR
MARKET OUTCOMES OF MINORITY
GROUPS ARE NOT AMENABLE TO MY
TERRY POLICY, AND MEASURES BE ON
THE SCOPE OF MONETARY POLICY
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED TO
ALLEVIATE THE ECONOMIC
CHALLENGES THAT THESE AND OTHER
AMERICANS FACE.
EDUCATION AND TRAINING ARE OF
COURSE VITAL.
LATER TODAY, I WILL VISIT ONE
PROGRAM THAT HELPS WORKERS IN
PHILADELPHIA LEARN NEW SKILLS
AND THEN CONNECT THEM WITH
POTENTIAL EMPLOYERS.
AN INITIATIVE IN WHICH
GOVERNMENT, BUSINESSES, AND
LOCAL INSTITUTIONS ARE WORKING
TOGETHER SUCCESSFULLY.
WHILE THE ECONOMY HAS MADE GREAT
STRIDES TOWARDS THE OBJECTIVE OF
MAXIMUM EMPLOYMENT, SOMEWHAT
LESS PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE
TOWARDS THE INFLATION OBJECTIVE.
INFLATION HAS RUN CONSISTENTLY
BELOW THE GOAL OF 2% OVER THE
PAST SEVERAL YEARS, EVEN AS THE
LABOR MARKET STRENGTH AND
SIGNIFICANTLY.
OVER THE 12 MONTH THROUGH APRIL,
THE PRICE INDEX FOR PERSONAL
CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURES ROSE
ONLY ABOUT 1%.
I REMAIN OPTIMISTIC BECAUSE TWO
FACTORS THAT HAVE BEEN HOLDING
FOUND INFLATION WILL LIKELY
PROVE ONLY TEMPORARY.
FIRST, THE SHARP DROP IN CRUDE
OIL PRICES SINCE THE MIDDLE OF
2014 HAS LOWERED PRICES OF
GASOLINE AND OTHER ENERGY
PRODUCTS, SIGNIFICANTLY
STRAINING OVERALL INFLATION.
AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME, THE
FOREIGN EXCHANGE VALUE OF THE
DOLLAR STRENGTHENED, HOLDING
DOWN PRICES OF IMPORTED GOODS.
OIL PRICES HAVE STOPPED
DECLINING.
INDEED, THEY HAVE RISEN FROM THE
LOW POINT EARLIER THIS YEAR.
AND THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR,
THE DOLLAR HAS BEEN ROUGHLY
UNCHANGED AGAINST A BROAD WRATH
OF CURRENCIES -- BATH OF
CURRENCIES.
AS THE LABOR MARKET STRENGTHENS
FURTHER, I EXPECT INFLATION TO
MOVE BACK TO 2%.
LET ME NOW TURN TO THE OUTLOOK
FOR THE ECONOMY.
GDP GROWTH WAS REPORTED TO HAVE
BEEN RELATIVELY WEAK THIS YEAR.
THIS MEASURE OF GROWTH AND
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY CAN VARY
SIGNIFICANTLY FROM QUARTER TO
QUARTER.
INDEED, WHILE SPENDING DATA FOR
THE SECOND QUARTER ARE LIMITED
AT PRESENT, RECENT DATA ON
RETAIL SALES AND MOTOR VEHICLE
SALES .2 A SIGNIFICANT STEP UP
IN CONSUMER SPENDING AND GDP
GROWTH THIS QUARTER.
STEPPING BACK FROM NEAR TERM
INDICATORS, I WOULD LIKE TO
FOCUS MORE BROADLY ON THE
FACTORS LIKELY TO AFFECT
ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OVER THE
COMING YEARS.
NEXT WEEK, CONCURRENT WITH OUR
POLICY MEETING, PARTICIPANTS
WILL RELEASE A NEW SET OF
ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS.
THOSE COULD OF COURSE DIFFER
FROM THE PREVIOUS SET OF SAID
PROJECTIONS IN MARCH, BUT,
SPEAKING FOR MYSELF, ALTHOUGH
THE ECONOMY HAS RECENTLY BEEN
AFFECTED BY A MIX OF
COUNTERVAILING FORCES, ICY GOOD
REASONS TO EXPECT THAT A
POSITIVE FORCE IS SUPPORTING
GROWTH AND HIGHER INFLATION BOOK
CONTINUE TO OUTWEIGH THE
NEGATIVE ONES.
AS A RESULT, I EXPECT ECONOMIC
EXPANSION TO CONTINUE WITH THE
LABOR MARKET GROWING FURTHER AND
GDP GROWING MODERATELY.
I EXPECT TO SEE GDP -- INFLATION
MOVING TO 2% OVER THE COMING
YEARS.
LET ME START WITH THE POSITIVE.
THE INCREASE IN EMPLOYMENT OVER
THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS HAS
CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER HOUSEHOLD
INCOMES AND STRENGTHENING
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE.
IT'S IN MAY LABOR REPORT WAS AN
ABERRATION, OR REFLECTS A
TEMPORARY SLOWDOWN RESULTING
FROM THE WEAKNESS IN ECONOMIC
ACTIVITY AT THE START OF THE
YEAR, THEN JOB GROWTH SHOULD
PICK UP AND SUPPORT FURTHER
GROWTH IN INCOME.
IN ADDITION, RISING EQUITY AND
HOUSE PRICES HAS RESTORED
HOUSEHOLD WEALTH.
THE FOLLOWING -- FALL IN OIL
PRICES HAS SUPPORTED PURCHASING
POWER AS WELL.
AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD HAS GAINED
SOME $1300 IN PURCHASING POWER
SINCE MAY 2014 FROM THE FALL IN
GAS PRICES.
WITH CONTINUING GAINS AND
DISPOSABLE INCOME IN WEALTH, I
EXPECT CONSUMER SPENDING TO GROW
AT A SOLID RATE.
I ALSO EXPECT THE HOUSING SECTOR
TO MAKE FURTHER PROGRESS.
BOTH HOME SALES AND CONSTRUCTION
HAVE BEEN GRADUALLY IMPROVING
AND RESIDENTIAL INVESTMENT MADE
A NOTABLE CONTRIBUTION TO GDP
GROWTH OVER THE PAST YEAR.
HOUSING HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY
LOW MORTGAGE RATES AND ALL
MORTGAGE CREDIT IS STILL
DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN FOR
HOUSEHOLDS WITH LOW CREDIT
SCORES WERE HARD TO DOCUMENT
INCOME, THOSE WITH GOOD CREDIT
HISTORIES ARE GENERALLY ABLE TO
BORROW AT VERY FAVORABLE TERMS.
AND,  FISCAL POLICY AT
COMBINED LOCAL, STATE, AND
NATIONAL LEVELS HA -- IS NOW A
SMALL POSITIVE.
ECONOMISTS OFTEN SAY, WELL
KEEPING WITH THAT TRADITION, I
WILL NOW -- ECONOMISTS OFTEN
SAY, ON THE ONE HAND.
WELL KEEPING WITH THAT
TRADITION, I WILL NOW SAY, ON
THE OTHER HAND.
CONCERNS ABOUT SLOWING GROWTH
IN CHINA AND FALLING COMMODITY
PRICES WHICH AFFLICTED FINANCIAL
MARKETS EARLY THIS YEAR AND
LIKELY WEIGHED ON DEMANDS APPEAR
TO HAVE EASED SOMEWHAT.
INDICATORS SUGGEST THAT FOREIGN
ECONOMIES ARE GROWING, IT'S
STILL HAD ONLY A MODERATE PACE.
FOREIGN FINANCIAL MARKETS HAVE
RECOVERED AND STABILIZE.
THAT SAID, AND THAT EXPORTS -- 
NET EXPORTS HAVE BEEN A DRAG
ON GDP OVER THE LAST YEAR.
THIS DRAG, IN PART, REFLECTS THE
PROLONGED EFFECTS OF THE
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE
FOREIGN EXCHANGE VALUE OF THE
DOLLAR SINCE THE MIDDLE OF 2014.
THE DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN
PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING FOR
U.S. MANUFACTURERS AND OTHER
FIRMS COMPETING WITH FOREIGN
PRODUCERS.
WHILE LOWER OIL PRICES HAVE
LIKELY BEEN A POSITIVE INFLUENCE
ON THE U.S. ECONOMY OVER ALL,
THEY ALSO HAVE HAD A NEGATIVE
SIDE, GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE U.S.
ENERGY INDUSTRY.
NEW DRILLING AND ENERGY TO
EMPLOYMENT HAVE PLUNGED, AND THE
EFFECTS HAVE SPILLED OVER TO
BUSINESSES SERVING THE ENERGY
SECTOR.
THE LARGEST DECLINES IN DRILLING
ACTIVITY ARE LIKELY NOW BEHIND
US.
WITH OIL PRICES HAVING RECOVERED
SOMEWHAT, I EXPECT OIL PRICES
WILL BECOME LESS OF A FACTOR.
THIS HAS BEEN WEAK IN THE
PAST SIX MONTHS OR SO.
INVESTMENT IN CAPITAL EQUIPMENT
IS REPORTED TO HAVE DECLINED IN
THE LAST QUARTER OF 2015 AND THE
FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR.
I SUSPECT THERE IS A TRANSITORY
ELEMENT TO THIS WEAK
INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE, AND I
EXPECT IT TO REBOUND.
THE LATEST MARKET DATA RAISES
THE LIST FAVORABLE POSSIBILITY
THAT FIRMS MAY EXPAND SLOWLY.
I INTEND TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION
TO DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS AREA.
AS I SAID, THE POSITIVE ECONOMIC
FORCES HAVE OUTWEIGHED THE
NEGATIVE, AND DESPITE THE
CHALLENGES THAT THE ECONOMY
CONTINUES TO FACE, I CONTINUED
TO EXPECT FURTHER PROGRESS
TOWARDS OUR EMPLOYMENT AND
INFLATION OBJECTIVES.
TO BE SURE, THERE IS
CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT
THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK THAT I HAVE
BEEN DISCUSSING.
AS I HAVE ALREADY NOTED, WE
SHOULD EXPECT TO BE SURPRISED IN
THE FUTURE, JUST AS WE HAVE BEEN
SURPRISED IN THE PAST.
FOR AREAS OF -- FOUR AREAS OF
UNCERTAINTY SEEM PARTICULARLY
SALIENT AT THE PRESENT.
THE FIRST INVOLVES THE TRUST AND
RESILIENCE OF DOMESTIC DEMAND.
THE U.S. ECONOMY HAS PERFORMED
BETTER THAN MANY OTHERS AROUND
THE GLOBE.
THAT PERFORMANCE HAS RELIED IF
THE ON THE RESILIENCE OF
DOMESTIC SOURCES OF DEMAND,
CONSUMER SPENDING IN PARTICULAR.
AN IMPORTANT QUESTION IS WHETHER
THE U.S. ECONOMY COULD CONTINUE
TO MAKE PROGRESS AMID FAIRLY
CONSIDERABLE GLOBAL BUMPING
THIS.
I CONTINUE TO INC. THAT THE
ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS YES,
BUT THE WEAK INVESTMENT
PERFORMANCE IN RECENT MONTHS IS
CONCERNING AND FRIDAY'S
EMPLOYMENT REPORT IS A REMINDER
THAT THE QUESTION IS STILL
RELEVANT.
THE SECOND UNCERTAINTY PERTAINS
TO THE ECONOMIC SITUATION
ABROAD.
EVEN THOUGH THE FINANCIAL
STRESSES EMANATED FROM ABROAD AT
THE START OF THIS YEAR HAS
EASED, GLOBAL RISKS REQUIRE
CONTINUED ATTENTION DURING MUCH
OF THE TURMOIL EARLY THIS YEAR A
P TO THE ASSOCIATED WITH THE
OUTLOOK OVER CHINESE GROWTH,
WHICH IN TURN, HAS BROUGHT IN
LOCATIONS -- BROAD IMPLICATIONS
FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH.
RECENTLY, IT HAS MOVED IN A MORE
PARTICULAR FASHION AND FLOWS
HAVE ABATED.
HOWEVER, IT IS WHY THEY
KNOWLEDGE THAT CHINA FACES
CONSIDERABLE CHALLENGES AS IT
CONTINUES TO REBALANCE THE
ECONOMY TOWARDS DOMESTIC DEMAND
AND CONSUMPTION.
MORE GENERALLY, IN THE CURRENT
ENVIRONMENT OF SLUGGISH GROWTH,
THOUGH INFLATION, AND ALREADY
VERY ACCOMMODATIVE MONETARY
POLICIES IN MANY ADVANCED
ECONOMIES, INVESTOR PERCEPTIONS
OF AN APPETITE FOR RISK CAN
CHANGE ABRUPTLY.
ONE DEVELOPMENT THAT COULD SHIFT
INVESTOR SENTIMENT IS THE
UPCOMING REFERENDUM IN THE
UNITED KINGDOM.
A U.K. VOTE TO EXIT THE EUROPEAN
UNION COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT
ECONOMIC REPERCUSSIONS.
THE THIRD KEY UNCERTAINTY FOR
THE U.S. ECONOMY IS THE OUTLOOK
FOR PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH.
THAT IS INCREASES IN THE AMOUNT
OF OUTPUT PRODUCED PER HOUR
WORKED.
WHILE THE JOB MARKET HAS
STRENGTHENED SIGNIFICANTLY, GDP
INCREASES HAVE BEEN LESS
IMPRESSIVE.
THE COMBINATION OF SOLID LABOR
MARKET GAINS AND WATER GDP
GROWTH REFLECTS THE FACT THAT
LABOR PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH HAS
BEEN UNUSUALLY WEAK IN RECENT
YEARS, AVERAGING LESS THAN .5%
PER YEAR SINCE 2010.
OVER TIME, PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH
IS THE KEY DETERMINANT OF
IMPROVEMENTS IN LIVING
STANDARDS.
SUPPORTING HIGHER PAY FOR
WORKERS WITHOUT INCREASED COST
FOR WORKERS.
RECENT WEAK PRODUCTIVITY
GROWTH ACCOUNTS FOR WAGE GAINS
IN THE ECONOMIC EXPANSION.
THEREFORE, UNDERSTANDING WEATHER
AND BY HOW MUCH IS A CRUCIAL
PART OF THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK.
THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT
QUESTION AND ECONOMISTS ARE
DIVIDED.
SOME ARE RELATIVELY OPTIMISTIC,
POINTING TO THE ONGOING CASE
THAT PROMISE NEW TECHNOLOGIES
FROM MEDICAL THERAPIES TO SELF
DRIVING CARS.
OTHERS BELIEVE THAT THE LOW
HANGING FRUIT OF INNOVATION
LARGELY HAS BEEN PICKED AND
THERE IS  SIMPLY LESS SCOPE
FOR FURTHER GAINS.
MY POSITION HAS BEEN CAUTIOUSLY
OPTIMISTIC.
THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT THE
DEEPER SESSION HAD A
LONG-LASTING EFFECT IN
DEPRESSING INVESTMENT, RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING, AND
THE STARTUP OF NEW FIRMS.
THESE FACTORS HAVE IN TURN
LOWERED PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH RATE
WITH TIME, I EXPECT THIS EFFECT
TO EASE IN A STRONGER ECONOMY.
I ALSO SEE NO SLOW DOWN
IN THE CASE WITH THE POTENTIAL
BENEFITS OF INNOVATION IN
AMERICA, WHICH LIKEWISE MAY BEAR
MORE TRUE IN A STRONGER
ECONOMY.
IN THE MEANTIME, IT WOULD BE
HELPFUL TO ADOPT PUBLIC POLICIES
TO BOOST PRODUCTIVITY.
STRENGTHENING EDUCATION AND
PROMOTING INVESTMENT -- PUBLIC
AND PRIVATE -- WILL SUPPORT
LONGER-TERM GROWTH IN
PRODUCTIVITY AND GREATER
GAINS IN LIVING STANDARDS.
A FOURTH IMPORTANT UNCERTAINTY
FOR ECONOMIC OUTLOOK INVOLVES
HOW QUICKLY INFLATION WILL MOVE
BACK TO 2%.
AS LONG AS OIL PRICES DO NOT
RESUME THE EARLIER
DECLINES AND THE DOLLAR DOES NOT
RISE SUBSTANTIALLY FURTHER, MIKE
EXPECTATION IS THAT INFLATION
WILL MOVE UP TO 2% OVER THE NEXT
1-2 YEARS.
BUT, OIL PRICES AND THE DOLLAR
CAN MOVE UP ADDICTIVELY -- MOVE
 UNPREDICTABLY.
ESTIMATES ARE INHERENTLY
IMPRECISE AND THE EFFECT ON
INFLATION COULD TURN OUT TO BE
SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT, EITHER
UPWARD OR DOWNWARD OF WHAT I
EXPECT.
CONSIDERING THE OUTLOOK ON
INFLATION ALSO CONSIDERS IN PART
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE
EXPECTATIONS THAT ARE RELATIVE
TO PRICE SETTING.
FOR TWO DECADES, INFLATION HAS
BEEN RELATIVELY UNSTABLE,
REACTING LESS PERSISTENTLY THAN
BEFORE TEMPORARY FACTORS LIKE
RECESSION OR A SWING IN OIL
PRICES.
THE MOST CONVINCING EXPLANATION
FOR THIS, IN MY VIEW, IS THAT
LONGER-TERM EXPECTATIONS HAVE
REMAINED QUITE STABLE.
PROXIES FOR THE EXPECTATIONS
INFERRED FROM FINANCIAL MARKET
INSTRUMENTS LIKE INFLATION
PROTECTED SECURITIES HAVE MOVED
DOWN MORE NOTICEABLY.
IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THESE
INDICATORS POINT TO A TRUE
DECLINE IN THE EXPECTATIONS THAT
ARE RELATIVE FOR PRICE SETTING.
FOR EXAMPLE, THE MEASURES MAY
REFLECT CHANGING ATTITUDES IN
INFLATION RISKS, MORE THAN
ACTUAL EXPECTATIONS, BUT THE
INDICATORS HAVE MOVED ENOUGH TO
GET MY CLOSE ATTENTION.
IF INFLATION EXPECTATIONS REALLY
ARE MOVING LOWER, THAT COULD
CALL INTO QUESTION WHETHER
INFLATION WILL MOVE BACK TO 2%
AS QUICKLY AS I EXPECT LET ME
NOW TURN TO THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AS WELL AS
THE UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED
WITH THE OUTLOOK FOR MONETARY
POLICY.
MY OVERALL ASSESSMENT IS THAT
THE CURRENT STANCE OF MONETARY
POLICY IS GENERALLY APPROPRIATE
IN THAT IT IS PROVIDING SUPPORT
FOR THE ECONOMY BY ENCOURAGING
FURTHER LABOR MARKET IMPROVEMENT
THAT WILL HELP RETURN INFLATION
TO 2%.
AT THE SAME TIME, I CONTINUE TO
THINK THAT THE FEDERAL FUNDS
RATE PROBABLY WILL NEED TO RISE
GRADUALLY OVER TIME TO ENSURE
STABILITY AND MAXIMUM
SUSTAINABLE EMPLOYMENT IN THE
LONG RUN.
SEVERAL CONSIDERATIONS NEED ME
TO THIS -- LEAD ME TO THIS
CONCLUSION.
FIRST, THE CURRENT STANCE ON
MONETARY POLICY IS IN MILITANT
 EMULATIVE.
DEFINED AS THE LEVEL OF THE
FEDERAL FUNDS RATE THAT WOULD HE
 BE NEITHER
EXPANSIONARY ORD REACTIONARY.
THIS NEUTRAL RATE CHANGES OVER
TIME.
AT ANY GIVEN DATE, IT RELIES ON
A CONSTELLATION OF UNDERLYING
FORCES AFFECTING THE ECONOMY.
AT PRESENT, MANY ESTIMATES
SHOWED THE RATE TO BE QUITE LOW
BY.
INDEED, CLOSE TO ZERO WHEN
MEASURED IN REAL OR INFLATION
-ADJUSTED TERMS.
THE CURRENT ACTUAL VALUE OF THE
FEDERAL FUNDS RATE ALSO MEASURED
IN REAL TERMS IS EVEN LOWER.
SOMEWHERE AROUND -1%.
WITH THE ACTUAL REAL FEDERAL
FUNDS RATE MODESTLY BELOW THE
RELATIVELY LOW NEUTRAL RATE, THE
STANCE OF MONETARY POLICY AT
PRESENT SHOULD BE VIEWED AS
MODESTLY ACCOMMODATIVE.
WHILE THE ECONOMY IS NOW FAIRLY
CLOSE TO THE FOMC'S GOAL OF
MAXIMUM EMPLOYMENT, A VIEW OF
MODEST ACCOMMODATIVE POLICY IS
APPROPRIATE FOR SEVERAL REASONS.
FIRST, WITH INFLATION CONTINUING
TO RUN BELOW OUR OBJECTIVE, A
MILD UNDERSHOOTING OF THE
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE CONSIDERED TO
BE NORMAL IN THE LONGER RUN
COULD HELP INFLATION, COULD HELP
MOVE INFLATION BACK TO 2% MORE
QUICKLY.
SECOND, A STRONGER JOB MARKET
COULD ALSO SUPPORT LABOR MARKET
IMPROVEMENT ALONG OTHER
DIMENSIONS, INCLUDING GREATER
LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION.
THE THIRD REASON RELATES TO THE
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE
CONSTRAINT ON CONVENTIONAL
MONETARY POLICY WHEN THE FEDERAL
FUNDS RATE IS NEAR ZERO.
IF INFLATION WERE TO MOVE
PERSISTENTLY ABOVE 2%, OR THE
ECONOMY WERE TO BECOME
NOTICEABLY OVERHEATED, THE
COMMITTEE COULD READILY INCREASE
THE TARGET RANGE FOR THE FEDERAL
FUNDS RATE.
HOWEVER, IF INFLATION WORK TO
REMAIN PERSISTENTLY LOW OR IF
THE EXPANSION WERE TO FALTER,
THE FOMC WOULD BE ABLE TO
PROVIDE ONLY A LIMITED AMOUNT OF
ADDITIONAL STIMULUS THROUGH
CONVENTIONAL MEANS.
THESE MOTIVATIONS
NOTWITHSTANDING, I CONTINUE TO
BELIEVE IT WILL BE APPROPRIATE
TO GRADUALLY REDUCE THE DEGREE
OF MONETARY POLICY ACCOMMODATION
, PROVIDED LABOR MARKET
CONDITIONS STRENGTHEN FURTHER,
AND INFLATION CONTINUES TO MAKE
PROGRESS TOWARD OUR 2% OBJECTIVE
.
BECAUSE MONETARY POLICY AFFECTS
THE ECONOMY WITH A LAG, STEPS TO
WITHDRAW THIS MONETARY
ACCOMMODATION OUGHT TO BE
INITIATED BEFORE THE FOMC'S
GOALS ARE FULLY REACHED.
AND IF THE HEADWINDS THAT HAVE
LINGERED AS THE CRISIS SLOWLY
ABATE, AS I ANTICIPATE, THIS
WOULD MEAN THAT THE NEUTRAL RATE
OF INTEREST ITSELF WOULD MOVE UP
, PROVIDING FURTHER IMPETUS TO
GRADUAL INCREASES IN THE FEDERAL
ONES RIGHT -- FUNDS RATE.
BUT I STRESS THE ECONOMIC
OUTLOOK, INCLUDING THE PACE AT
WHICH THE NEUTRAL RATE MAY SHIFT
OVER TIME IS UNCERTAIN, SO
MONETARY POLICY CANNOT PROCEED
ON ANY PRESET PATH.
THIS POINT IS WELL ILLUSTRATED
BY EVENTS SO FAR THIS YEAR.
FOR A TIME IN JANUARY AND EARLY
FEBRUARY, FINANCIAL MARKETS HERE
AND ABROAD BECAME TURBULENT, AND
FINANCIAL CONDITIONS TIGHTENED,
REFLECTING AND REINFORCING
CONCERNS ABOUT DOWNSIDE RISKS TO
THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.
IN ADDITION, DATA RECEIVED
DURING THE WINTER SUGGESTED U.S.
GROWTH HAD WEAKENED, EVEN AS
PROGRESS IN THE LABOR MARKET
REMAINS SOLID.
BECAUSE THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THESE DEVELOPMENTS FOR THE
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK WERE UNCLEAR,
THE FOMC DECIDED AT ITS IN
JANUARY, MARCH, AND APRIL
MEETINGS, THAT IT WOULD BE
PRUDENT TO MAINTAIN DATE
EXISTING TARGET RANGE FOR THE
FEDERAL FUNDS RATE.
OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS,
FINANCIAL CONDITIONS HAVE
RECOVERED SIGNIFICANTLY AND MANY
OF THE RISKS FROM ABROAD HAVE
DIMINISHED, ALTHOUGH SOME RISKS
REMAIN.
IN ADDITION, CONSUMER SPENDING
APPEARS TO HAVE REBOUNDED,
PROVIDING SOME REASSURANCE THAT
OVERALL GROWTH HAS, INDEED,
PICKED UP AS EXPECTED.
UNFORTUNATELY, AS I NOTED
EARLIER, NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THE
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK HAVE BEEN
RAISED BY THE RECENTLY FOR
MARKET DATA.
IS THE MARKEDLY REDUCED PACE OF
HIRING IN APRIL AND MAY A
HARBINGER OF A PERSISTENT
SLOWDOWN IN THE BROADER ECONOMY?
OR WILL MONTHLY PAYROLL GAINS
MOVE UP TO THE SOLID PACE THEY
MAINTAINED EARLIER THIS YEAR AND
IN EARLY 2015?
DOES THE LATEST READING ON THE
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE INDICATE WE
ARE ESSENTIALLY BACK TO FULL
EMPLOYMENT?
OR DOES RELATIVELY SUBDUED WAGE
GROWTH SIGNAL MORE SLACK
REMAINS?
MY COLLEAGUES AND I WILL BE
WRESTLING WITH THESE AND OTHER
RELATED QUESTIONS GOING FORWARD.
TO SUMMARIZE, I HAVE EXPLAINED
WHY I EXPECT THE U.S. ECONOMY
WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE AND WHY
I EXPECT FURTHER GRADUAL
INCREASES IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS
RATE WILL PROBABLY BE
APPROPRIATE TO BEST PROMOTE THE
FOMC'S GOALS MAXIMUM EMPLOYMENT
AND PRICE STABILITY.
I HAVE ALSO LAID OUT THE
CONSIDERABLE AND UNAFFORDABLE
UNCERTAIN THESE THAT APPLY TO
BOTH THIS OUTLOOK FOR THE
ECONOMY, AND TO THE APPROPRIATE
PATH OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE.
MY COLLEAGUES AND I WILL MAKE
OUR POLICY DECISIONS BASED ON
WHAT INCOMING INFORMATION
IMPLIES FOR THE OUTLOOK, AND THE
RISK TO THAT OUTLOOK.
WHAT IS CERTAIN IS THAT MONETARY
POLICY IS NOT ON A PRESET COURSE
AND THAT THE COMMITTEE WILL
RESPOND TO NEW DATA AND REASSESS
RISK SO AS THE BEST TO ACHIEVE
OUR GOALS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
SCARLET: OF COURSE, THAT IS
VENTURE JANET YELLEN WRAPPING UP
HER SPEECH IN PHILADELPHIA.
LET'S GET SOME ANALYSIS FROM
MIKE MCKEE.
WHAT WAS YOUR BIG TAKE AWAY?
MIKE: JANET YELLEN WAS AS
SURPRISED BY ANYBODY ELSE AT THE
ECONOMIC WEAKNESS IN MAY.
AT THIS POINT, SHE IS TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHERE WE GO FROM HERE
WITHOUT BEING TOO PESSIMISTIC.
NOW SHE WILL TAKE SOME
QUESTIONS, I GUESS.
>> WHETHER TO KEEP SHORT-TERM
INTEREST RATES LOW, IS YOUR
PRIMARY CONCERN GDP GROWTH AND
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OVER THE
NEXT FEW YEARS, OR DO YOU ALSO
CONSIDER THE NEGATIVE FOLLOW-ON
EFFECTS THAT OCCUR MUCH LATER,
DUE TO LOW INTEREST RATES, SUCH
AS -- AS YOU HAVE HEARD BEFORE
-- CONSUMERS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF
THE LOW INTEREST RATES, DEFINED
PENSION BENEFIT PLANS HAVING TO
INVEST MORE MONEY, MEANING LESS
SPENDING NOW, OR ALTERNATIVELY,
UNDERFUNDED NOW AND DEFAULT
LATER.
DO YOU TAKE THAT INTO
CONSIDERATION?
TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU BALANCE
ONE VERSUS THE OTHER?
CHAIR YELLEN: THANK YOU FOR THE
QUESTION.
THE FEDERAL RESERVE TAKES ITS
MANDATE AND APPROPRIATE
OBJECTIVES FROM CONGRESS.
CONGRESS HAS ASSIGNED TO US TWO
MAIN GOALS, MAINLY FULL
EMPLOYMENT, AND PRICE STABILITY.
THAT IS OUR FOCUS.
THAT IS WHAT WE KEEP OUR EYES ON
.
YOU ASKED IF OUR FOCUS IS JUST
THE NEXT COUPLE OF QUARTERS, AND
THE ANSWER TO THAT IS ABSOLUTELY
NO.
WE ARE TRYING TO TAKE A MEDIUM
AND LONG-TERM PERSPECTIVE IN
SETTING MONETARY POLICY.
WE RESPOND, AND OUR VIEWS ON
POLICY, RESPOND TO INCOMING DATA
SUCH AS THE SURPRISE LIKE THE
LABOR MARKET REPORT LAST FRIDAY,
ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT WE
DETERMINE, OR COME TO THE VIEW,
THAT THE DATA IS MEANINGFUL IN
TERMS OF CHANGING OUR VIEW OF
THE MEDIUM AND LONGER-TERM
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK.
SO WE ARE FOCUSED ON A MEDIUM
AND LONGER-TERM.
YOU MENTIONED VARIOUS NEGATIVE
IMPACTS OF LOW INTEREST RATES,
WHICH WE WILL RECOGNIZE -- WELL
RECOGNIZE.
YOU MENTIONED THE IMPACT ON
INSURANCE COMPANIES, PENSION
FUNDS, THE FACT THAT LOW
INTEREST RATES CAN REACH
ENTITIES LIKE NOSE, BUT ALSO
ORDINARY INVESTORS TO REACH FOR
YIELD TO TAKE ON RISK THAT COULD
ULTIMATELY HAVE SERIOUS NEGATIVE
CONSEQUENCES.
OF COURSE, AS WE SAW, MOST
IMPORTANTLY AND DRAMATICALLY IN
THE CASE OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS
, SUCH RISK-TAKING BEHAVIOR,
WHEN IT BECOMES REALLY EXCESSIVE
, HAS IN THE MEDIUM AND
LONGER-TERM, VERY SERIOUS
AFFECTS FOR THE ECONOMY, AND THE
ATTAINMENT OF EMPLOYMENT AND
PRICE STABILITY GOALS THAT
CONGRESS ASSIGNED TO US.
SO WE LOOK VERY CAREFULLY AT
FINANCIAL STABILITY RISKS.
WE TRY TO ASSESS THOSE.
ON OCCASIONS, I THINK, WHILE
MOST OF MY COLLEAGUES AND I
BELIEVE THERE ARE OTHER TOOLS
THAT CAN BE USED TO ADDRESS
EMERGING FINANCIAL STABILITY
RISK, SO-CALLED SUPERVISORY
TOOLS, I WOULD NEVER RULE OUT
THE POSSIBILITY THAT IF WE
THOUGHT A STANCE OF LOW INTEREST
RATES WAS GIVING RISE TO SERIOUS
FINANCIAL STABILITY RISKS, THAT
THAT COULD BE A FACTOR AFFECTING
POLICY.
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
TODAY.
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK ABOUT THE
DYNAMICS ON THE COMMITTEE AND
YOUR ROLE AS CHAIR.
I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF
IMPRESSION IN THE FINANCIAL
METEOR AMONG MARKET PARTICIPANTS
THAT ESSENTIALLY YOUR VOTE IS
THE ONE THAT MATTERS.
CLEARLY, YOU ARE THE CHAIR, BUT
THERE ARE ALSO THE OTHER PEOPLE
IN THE ROOM.
I WONDER HOW YOU VIEW YOUR ROLE,
COMING INTO THE MEETING WITH AN
OUTCOME YOU ARE EXPECTING,
VERSUS JUDGING WHERE THE
COMMITTEE IS.
I WONDER IF YOU FACED THIS
SITUATION IT DURING YOUR TERM AS
CHAIR, WHERE YOU WERE EXPECTING
ONE OUTCOME AND WERE SWAYED BY
THE COMMITTEE.
CHAIR YELLEN: THANK YOU.
THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM WAS
INTENTIONALLY DESIGNED TO BE ONE
WHERE MANY INDEPENDENT VOICES
AND FINGERS -- THINKERS WOULD
COME TOGETHER AND WORK TOGETHER,
BUT TO BRING TOGETHER IN THE
POINT IT -- INDEPENDENT POINTS
OF VIEW FORMED IN PART BY THE
CONTEXT BY THE RESERVE BANK
PRESIDENTS AND WE IN WASHINGTON
ALSO HAVE CONTACTS WITH OUR
LOCAL COMMUNITIES, BUSINESSES,
HOUSEHOLDS, CONSUMERS IN OUR
COMMUNITIES, ASSESSING AND
BRINGING TO BEAR INFORMATION
ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND THE
OUTLOOK.
I HAVE ASSEMBLED AROUND THE
TABLE AT THE MOMENT -- WE ARE
TWO SHORT.
WE ARE 17 INTELLIGENT,
THOUGHTFUL INDIVIDUALS WHO COME
WITH THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT
THOUGHTS.
I FEEL MY JOB IS TO, FIRST OF
ALL, ADD MY OWN THOUGHTS.
I AM ALSO THINKING ABOUT ALL OF
THIS DATA AND WHAT IS THE RIGHT
POLICY.
WE SHARE OUR THOUGHTS WITH ONE
ANOTHER.
NOT ONLY AT THE MEETING BUT ALSO
IN THE RUN-UP TO THE MEETING AND
IN OTHER OCCASIONS WE TALKED TO
ONE ANOTHER.
I LOOK TO ACHIEVE A CONSENSUS IN
THE COMMITTEE.
SOMETIMES PEOPLE TO SEND --
DISSENT.
I BELIEVE I HAVE SEEN AS MANY AS
THREE DISSENTS ON ONE
OCCASION.
CERTAINLY, SOME DISSENT IS TO BE
EXPECTED IN AN ECONOMY AS
COMPLEX AS OURS, SOMETIMES
CHANGES BASED ON INTERPRETATIONS
OF WHAT IS HAPPENING.
I AM LOOKING TO FIND A CONSENSUS
TO TRY TO HELP FORM THAT
CONSENSUS.
I THINK MY COLLEAGUES LOOKED TO
ME TO EXPLAIN WHAT THAT
CONSENSUS IS.
I WILL SAY, I HAVE NEVER FOUND
IT A DIFFICULTY TO BE IN THAT
CONSENSUS MYSELF, SO I CANNOT
THINK OF ANY OCCASION WHERE THE
OUTCOME, OR DECISION AT A
MEETING, IS ONE THAT I HAVE NOT
BEEN PERSONALLY COMFORTABLE
WITH.
I THINK WE HAVE COME TOGETHER AS
A COMMITTEE, AND WHILE THERE ARE
A RANGE OF VIEWS, THE WORLD
HEARS THEM EXPRESSED, I THINK WE
HAVE CONSIDERABLE CONSENSUS AND
RESPECT FOR ONE ANOTHER.
>> MY QUESTION REGARDS
COMMUNICATION AND THE ABILITY TO
PROVIDE ANY INSIGHT OR FORWARD
GUIDANCE TO THE FINANCIAL
MARKETS, WHICH ARE NO DONE
WATCHING ALL OF THIS VERY JUST
DELETE.
YOU REFER TO THE DESIRE TO
GRADUALLY NORMALIZE RATES TO A
REAL NORMAL LEVEL, WHICH IS
ABOVE THE RATE WE SEE TODAY.
AND YET, WITH THE DEGREE OF DATA
AND UNCERTAINTY AROUND WHETHER
THE RECENT DATA IS A TREND OR
ANOMALY, I WONDER IF YOU COULD
COMMENT ON THE ABILITY TO
PROVIDE GUIDANCE THAT IS ANY
MORE FORWARD-LOOKING THAN TWO OR
THREE WEEKS BASED ON THE DATA
COMING TO THE COMMITTEE?
CHAIR YELLEN: LET ME START BY
SAYING THE COMMITTEE FREQUENTLY
REFERS TO THIS PROCESS OF
NORMALIZING RATES.
I THINK MAYBE IT IS USEFUL TO
MAKE CLEAR THAT THAT IS NOT SOME
INDEPENDENT GOAL OF MONETARY
POLICY THAT WE HAVE FULL
EMPLOYMENT, PRICE STABILITY, AND
NORMALIZATION OF RATES.
MOST OF MY COLLEAGUES AND I
BELIEVE, IN A PRETTY NORMAL
ECONOMY, IT IS LIKELY TO BE
APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A HIGHER
LEVEL OF INTEREST RATES, PERHAPS
NOT THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE, BUT
SOMETHING HIGHER THAN WHAT WE
HAVE HAD IN RECENT YEARS.
EVEN THAT -- WHAT IS A NORMAL
LEVEL OF INTEREST RATES IN A
NORMAL ECONOMY?
I TRIED TO EMPHASIZE, LET ME SAY
AGAIN -- IT IS SOMETHING OVER
WHICH WE HAVE TO BE UNCERTAIN.
THERE HAVE BEEN SHIPS IN THE
ECONOMY.
I THINK THE CURRENT LEVEL OF
NEUTRAL OR NORMAL RATES IS
PRETTY LOW.
NOW, I DO BELIEVE THAT WILL TEND
TO RISE OVER TIME, WHICH IF IT
DOES, MEANS INTEREST RATES WOULD
APPROPRIATELY FOR THE ECONOMY
MOVE FURTHER UP, BUT I HAVE TO
SAY, THAT IS SOMETHING WE ARE
UNCERTAIN ABOUT AND HAVE TO FIND
OUT OVER TIME.
WITH RESPECT TO FORWARD GUIDANCE
, I KNOW MARKET PARTICIPANTS
REALLY WANT TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
IS GOING TO HAPPEN.
IT IS ONLY ON RARE OCCASIONS
WHERE WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE
THAT KIND OF GUIDANCE.
THERE IS, AS I SAID, ABOUT 18
TIMES, NO PRESET PLAN.
WE LOOK AT DATA AND WE HAVE TO
RETHINK THE OUTLOOK CONSTANTLY.
IN LIGHT OF THE CHANGED OUTLOOK,
REEVALUATE.
I REALLY THINK THE BEST WAY WE
CAN LEGITIMATELY DO IS EXPLAIN
WHAT FACTORS ARE GUIDING OUR
THINKING.
WE DO PROVIDE DETAILED
INFORMATION EVERY THREE MONTHS.
EACH PARTICIPANT -- AND THIS IS
NOT A COMMITTEE VIEW -- BUT ALL
17 PARTICIPANTS WRITE DOWN THEIR
ASSESSMENTS FOR THE LIKELY PATH
OF GDP GROWTH, INFLATION,
UNEMPLOYMENT, AND THE PATH OF
POLICY OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS
THAT THEY THINK GOES ALONG WITH
THAT AND IS APPROPRIATE.
I THINK THAT IS A LOT OF
INFORMATION.
THERE IS SOME DISAGREEMENT, BUT
LOOKING AT THE CENTRAL TENDENCY,
THAT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF VIEWS.
BUT AGAIN, THOSE VIEWS CHANGE,
THEY ARE NOT FIXED.
WE WILL NEVER SAY LOOK AT THE
PATH WE RUN DOWN IN MARCH.
THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.
WE CONSTANTLY HAVE TO BE
REACTING TO NEW DATA AND
RETHINKING AND QUESTIONING
THINGS WE THOUGHT PREVIOUSLY.
I THINK, DURING THE DEPTH OF THE
CRISIS, WE DID PROVIDE SOME MORE
CONCRETE FORWARD GUIDANCE.
WE THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO
DO THAT.
FOR EXAMPLE, WE GAVE VARIOUS
DATES AND SAID IT WOULD BE
UNLIKELY WE PROBABLY DID THIS IN
2011, 2012.
THAT WE WOULD BE RAISING THE
FUNDS RATE BEFORE MID-2013,
2015, OR BEFORE THE UNEMPLOYMENT
RATE DECLINED BELOW 6.5%.
WE HAD THE VIEW THAT THIS WAS A
VERY UNUSUAL DOWNTURN, THAT IT
WOULD BE LONG-LASTING, AND THAT
WE WOULD NEED TO HOLD INTEREST
RATES AT VERY LOW LEVELS FOR AN
UNUSUALLY LONG PERIOD OF TIME,
AND WITHOUT MAKING A PROMISE,
WERE TRYING TO COMMUNICATE THAT
VIEW TO MARKETS.
IT HELPED BECAUSE IT BROUGHT
DOWN LONGER-TERM INTEREST RATES,
WHICH HELPED THE ECONOMY, BUT
THAT WAS A VERY UNUSUAL PERIOD.
>> ONE LAST QUESTION OVER HERE.
>> THANK YOU FOR COMING.
BEING RETIRED, BEING AN EXTREME
LEHMAN INTO MY ECONOMICS, AND
LISTENING TO ALL OF THE MORNING
SHOWS ON SUNDAYS, AND ALL THE
CABLE SHOWS, NOT HAVING ANY
PARTICULAR INTEREST OF THE
CANDIDATES, EXCEPT IN ECONOMICS
AND MY RETIREMENT, THEY HAVE
MENTIONED, IF THE REPUBLICAN
CANDIDATE BECOMES PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES, THAT THERE IS
A POSSIBILITY OF AN ECONOMIC
CRASH ALL OVER THE WORLD BECAUSE
OF THE WORLD VIEWING DONALD
TRUMP, HOW THEY VIEW DONALD
TRUMP.
IS THIS A POSSIBILITY?
CHAIR YELLEN: I'M SORRY.
I HAVE NOTHING FOR YOU ON THAT.
WE ARE VERY FOCUSED ON DOING OUR
JOBS.
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
>> THANK YOU.
SCARLET: THIS CONCLUDES IN JANET
YELLEN'S Q&A SESSION IN
PHILADELPHIA.
GREAT LAST QUESTION.
MIKE: DONALD TRUMP HAS ALSO SAID
THAT HE WOULD REPLACE HER, SO
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHE COULD
TAKE PERSONALLY BUT DID NOT.
SHE JUST DODGED THE QUESTION.
ALIX: OVERALL, WE JUST GOT THE
TEXT OF HER STATEMENT.
YOUR RESPONSE WAS THIS WAS
TOWING THE PARTY LINE MORE THAN
ANTICIPATED.
DO YOU SEE THAT ONCE SHE GOT
INTO TALKING?
MIKE: BASICALLY, A REPEAT OF
WHAT SHE SAID IN HARVARD,
WITHOUT THE DATES.
NOW WE HAVE THIS WILD CARD OF A
WEAKER LABOR MARKET, AND DOES
THAT CONTINUE?
SO WE WANT TO SPREAD OUT WHAT
OUR POSSIBILITIES ARE.
IT DOES MEAN JUNE IS OFF THE
TABLE, WHICH SHE WOULD NEED IT
TO HAVE ENDORSE, IN ORDER TO
HAVE THEM BE A REALISTIC
POSSIBILITY.
JULY COULD BE ON THE TABLE
DEPENDING ON THE DATA.
SEPTEMBER, CERTAINLY THEY WILL
WATCH.
SHE IS THINKING THE ECONOMY IS
GETTING BETTER.
HER FRAME OF REFERENCE IS
PROBABLY AN ECONOMY THAT
DESERVES HIGHER RATES.
THE QUESTION IS, DOES THE DATA
SUPPORT THAT?
ALIX: INVESTORS SEEM PESSIMISTIC
.
TAKE A LOOK AT THE BLOOMBERG.
AS WE SAW JANET YELLEN SPEAK,
YOU SAW THE ODDS EVERY JULY RATE
HIKE MOVE LOWER, 29%.
IN JUNE, FORGET ABOUT IT.
THERE IS NO 50% OR MORE
EXPECTATION OF A RATE HIKE UNTIL
DECEMBER.
MIKE: WHAT WAS INTERESTING, SHE
SORT OF REFERENCED IN THAT WHEN
SHE SAID PEOPLE IN THE MARKETS
WANT TO KNOW THE EXACT TIME AND
DATE THAT WE WILL CONTINUALLY
DISAPPOINT THEM.
I DON'T HAVE AN ARGUMENT WITH
THE 2% FOR JUNE.
PROBABLY OFF THE TABLE, BUT YOU
WATCH THE JULY AND SEPTEMBER
FIGURES.
THEY WILL MOVE AROUND AS THE
DATA COMES IN.
AND DON'T FORGET, SHE HAS A
PRESS CONFERENCE AND THEN SHE
TESTIFIES TO CONGRESS.
CONGRESS WANT TO GET OUT OF TOWN
SO THEY CAN CAMPAIGN.
SO WE WILL BE SEEING A LOT OF
JANET YELLEN IN THE NEXT COUPLE
OF WEEKS.
THOSE NUMBERS COULD MOVE AROUND
A LOT.
SCARLET: ON OUR BLOOMBERG
FUNCTION, ONE OF THE COMMENTS
THAT WE HAVE COMPILED,  A HUGE
CONTRAST BETWEEN THE WAY JANET
YELLEN SPEAKS, HER TONE, AND
THAT OF ONE OF HER PREDECESSORS,
ALAN GREENSPAN.
JANET YELLEN'S OVERALL STANCE IS
WE DON'T KNOW.
GREENSPAN WAS, WE KNOW.
DIFFERENT ECONOMIC PERIOD, BUT
IT IS INTERESTING THAT THE
MARKETS ARE STRUGGLING WITH THIS
IDEA OF WAIT AND SEE.
MIKE: THE FED HAS CHANGED ITS
POLICY FROM BEING PROACTIVE TO
PREACTIVE.
THEY ARE FOLLOWING DATA NOW MORE
THAN GETTING AHEAD OF IT.
YOU ALSO HAVE A CHANGE IN THE
PERSONALITY OF THE CHAIR.
JANET YELLEN WAS ASKED, HOW
IMPORTANT ARE YOU IN THE GRAND
SCHEME OF THINGS?
WITH ALAN GREENSPAN, EVERYBODY
KNEW WHAT HE WANTED.
SHE SAID SHE HAS NEVER HAD THREE
DISSENTS SINCE SHE WAS CHAIR.
YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TIME TO 2011
THE LAST TIME THERE WERE THREE.
ALIX: TAKE A LOOK AT WITH THE
MARKETS ARE DOING, ESPECIALLY IN
THE YIELD MARKET.
JULIE HYMAN HAS A CHECK ON SOME
OF THE MOVERS.
JULIE: WHEN WE WERE FIRST
TALKING AT THE BEGINNING, WHEN
THEY GOT THE HEADLINES, BEFORE
SHE SPOKE, WE SAW A LITTLE BIT
OF A SPIKE IN THE YIELD OF THE
TWO-YEAR.
THEN IT CAME DOWN TO WHERE IT
WAS BEFORE THE SPEECH.
STILL AN INCREASE IN YIELD BUT
NOT A FURTHER INCREASE.
0.8%.
TAKE A LOOK AT THE U.S. DOLLAR.
THE BLOOMBERG DOLLAR INDEX.
WE SAW IN SLIDE AS SHE WAS
TALKING.
IT HAD BEEN HIGHER BUT NOT BY
MUCH.
NOW LOWER ON THE DAY VERSUS A
BASKET OF CURRENCIES.
ALSO, I HAVE BEEN WATCHING WIRP,
WATCHING THE CURVE OF
POSSIBILITIES FOR WHAT MAY
HAPPEN LATER IN THE YEAR.
2% IS NOW THE AUNT FOR THE JUNE
MEETING.
25.5% FOR JULY.
THEN ALL THE WAY OUT TO DECEMBER
BEFORE YOU GET 61% FOR THAT
MEETING.
QUICK CHECK ON GOLD.
A LOT OF VOLATILITY WHILE SHE
WAS SPEAKING.
STILL UP BY A THIRD OF 1%.
SCARLET: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF
THE EQUITIES MARKET?
JULIE: NOT SEEING A LOT OF
CHANGE.
ALL THREE MAJOR AVERAGES ARE UP
ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT AS THEY
WERE BEFORE SHE BEGAN TALKING.
PARTICULARLY, THE DOW IS UP
EXACTLY THE SAME.
OVER THE COURSE OF THE DAY, YOU
HAVE A BETTER PICTURE OF WHAT WE
HAVE SEEN.
A DECLINE GOING INTO HER
COMMENTS AND THEN COMING BACK
AGAIN.
JUST A STEADY MESSAGE IS WHAT
THE MARKET SEEMS TO BE
EXPRESSING.
ALSO, GROUPS ON THE MOVE
REMAINING RELATIVELY STABLE.
COMMODITY-L HE.
ENERGY, MATERIAL, FINANCIALS ALL
IN THE TOP SPOT.
UTILITIES ARE NOW DECLINING.
THEY TEND TO GO DOWN WHEN WE SEE
YIELD GO UP.
THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY A
SURPRISE MOVE.
IT REALLY FEELS LIKE A STEADY AS
SHE GOES SITUATION.
SCARLET: WHICH WAS THE KIND OF
MESSAGE SHE WAS TRYING TO
IMPART.
THANK YOU, JULIE HYMAN, AND
MICHAEL MCKEE.
ALIX: STILL AHEAD, GE HAS BEEN
MAKING BIG MOVES TO EXPAND ITS
SALES OF POWERGENERATING
EQUIPMENT.
WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT WITH THE
CEO OF THE GE POWER DIVISION,
WHO HAS BEEN MENTIONED AS A
POSSIBLE SUCCESSOR TO JEFFREY
IMMELT.
