so you can draw a straight line from all of this directly to robert muller now the new york times has new reporting on these special counsels interest in president Trump's business records and the big question what's the Russia connection joining us now investigative reporter for The New York Times TV Tour Steve Trump tweeted late last January I have nothing to do with Russia your piece defies that just a tiny tiny bit tell us about all the different connections with Russia that they could be looking into yeah sure well you know I think that when you look back over three decades there's you know all types of attempts to do business and in Russia considerations are doing business in Russia you know the president's side says look nothing that really ever happened but what's left on the table are a number of deals there was the Miss Universe pageant in 2013 there is you know a deal involving a hotel in 2015 and a number of is these things are left on the table it's unclear exactly what the special counsel is going to be looking at what their interest is but there are some things that you know could because curiosity so I'm curious Steve there's also the question of there's there's the the history of Trump trying to do business in Russia and then there's the history of Trump actually doing business all over the world with Russians so if you think about the totality of Trump's contact with with with Russia there's an awful lot there and and I do think the question is where do you see from what we know and obviously the Muller inquiry is kind of a black box we don't know but nobody's on the inside of that but on the basis of what we hear or what we've seen in the public knowledge of people who've spoken to Muller well what do where do you think the focus of what Muller is looking at is I you know but it is a mystery and that's part of the part of the you know the question for all of us and makes for a good debate to wonder where might he go what might be the thing that is of interest but there's a number of things I mean that you could look at here there's you know of course the Palm Beach mansion is another one of them there's the bank where Trump has done a lot of business over the years there's some options here in terms of places to look so Steve in the course in any investigation I assume in the course of your work as an investigative reporter for The Times on this story you're not gonna lot of doors some doors open and reveal things other doors remain closed how easy is it though behind one of these doors for someone in Russia close to Putin an oligarch a billionaire to buy houses condominiums in Florida in Atlantic City in New York City Trump Organization properties in other words money laundering how easy is that to occur well I mean it's certainly something that can occur that that you know could occur I think that's somewhat a question of the investigators if they're interested in this we'll have to look at some of that and decide whether there's any clear lines between those kinds of things and you know in relevance to their investigation what other things do you think that they would be prone to look at in addition to the money laundering aspect well I think you could look at some of some of the contacts you know there's the in the Miss Universe a pageant you know for example that's come up that you know later there was connections to the meeting at Trump Tower so there's and there's other types of things that are that are here you know beyond the money-laundering question Steve this is David Ignatius in Washington President Trump every time he mentions the Russia investigation repeats the same phrase there's no collusion and in your reporting do you feel as if you already have enough to make the counter-argument yes there is collusion or are you still still struggling to find the evidence for that yeah I think I think it's a good question from the reporting standpoint and we're looking you know more for some of this at the business side and looking at business dealings over the years and trying to kind of understand the Trump history in Russia and around Russia and with Russians the collusion question is a somewhat of a separate question to some extent what what's your instinct though having been on this story and knowing a lot about it certainly more than we do would you think that the the Muellers team is closer to a case on collusion or a case on tax fraud gosh you know I mean it's a good question and I think that it's something that you know we're probably gonna find out and you know in in due time wait a one way or another where this all leads but it's it's a bit of a black box strike trying to guess some of that at this point but you know I think that we know there's various things that are you know possibly part of that of the examination all right the new york times steve eater thank you very much benjamin with us put into perspective and you've been tweeting and writing a lot about this the firing of Andrew McCabe there there are certain things we don't know about it you don't want to jump to conclusions having said that there's an overall impact that it has in terms of his reputation right so look I would say it is too early to evaluate Andrew McCabe's conduct you know he served in my judgment with enormous dignity and an honor in the period lead leading up to and following the firing of Comey I think the country owes him a great debt that said the inspector general apparently found fault both with his conduct in the period before that and with his candor about it and there are some good career people who were involved in that and I will wait to see the inspector general's report and Andy's response to it before evaluating that it is not too early to evaluate the president's conduct which has he has been praying for this guy's blood in public for months and and it is not too early to say that the speed and timing of this thing smells awfully bad and that the you know what the military would call in in different contacts command influence you know you can't look at this situation without worrying whether jeff Sessions was executing what he thought to be the president's will in delivering a scalp that this that the president and demanded and so I'd say there are aspects of it that I want to reserve judgment on there are aspects of it that I think are you know naked ly in front of our eyes absolutely and Neal since you have taken on the Trump administration what do you think the biggest question out of all the news that happened over the weekend including the president's erotic behavior or unhinged how would you characterize it answer that as well but what do you think the biggest question is left hanging open right now in the Muller probe given everything that's happened well over the weekend the biggest thing I think is as Ben says Trump's conduct calling for the firing of this person I mean you know every president is tempted of course to say something about an individual case you know I saw it on Obama I saw it in Clinton and so on but of course presidents don't do that because it's crossing a red line it imagined the unfairness if you're a lone individual the President of the United States is attacking you and really sending a signal to his you know Attorney General Sessions who's kind of clinging on for this dear life to try and you know keep this job the unfairness is dramatic I mean this is the stuff of television episodes you know this is not the stuff that we should be seeing playing out in American politics today Neal Katyal Benjamin with us thank you very much and Heidi if you could stay with us that would be great still ahead on Morning Joe we know Donald Trump used
