1
00:00:00,406 --> 00:00:00,705
DEAL.

2
00:00:00,706 --> 00:00:04,209
HOW EXACTLY ARE YOU GOING TO

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:04,676
NEGOTIATE THAT.

4
00:00:04,677 --> 00:00:07,112
JESSE: JOBS HAVE BEEN COMING

5
00:00:07,113 --> 00:00:10,115
BACK IN A HUGE WAY.

6
00:00:10,116 --> 00:00:13,018
DONALD TRUMP DOUBLED THE

7
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,420
MANUFACTURING JOBS OBAMA HAD

8
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:18,523
SINCE TAKING OFFICE ON A MONTHLY

9
00:00:18,524 --> 00:00:21,293
BASIS.

10
00:00:21,294 --> 00:00:26,164
THE SON OF PRESIDENT TRUMP, ERIC

11
00:00:26,165 --> 00:00:26,465
TRUMP.

12
00:00:26,466 --> 00:00:30,268
I THINK HE SAID IT ON TWITTER

13
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:35,574
THE OTHER DAY, JOBS VERSUS

14
00:00:35,575 --> 00:00:36,208
MOB'S.

15
00:00:36,209 --> 00:00:39,111
>> YOU KNOW WHY HE GOT JOBS BACK

16
00:00:39,112 --> 00:00:41,046
AND OBAMA COULDN'T?

17
00:00:41,047 --> 00:00:43,782
BECAUSE HE IS A BUSINESSMAN.

18
00:00:43,783 --> 00:00:47,452
WE HAVE THE BEST ECONOMY

19
00:00:47,453 --> 00:00:49,321
PRACTICALLY WE HAVE EVER SEEN.

20
00:00:49,322 --> 00:00:53,358
WE HAVE MARKETS AT RECORD HIGHS.

21
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,094
GO COUNT LIST.

22
00:00:56,095 --> 00:00:57,863
401Ks ARE GOING CRAZY.

23
00:00:57,864 --> 00:01:01,833
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DON'T

24
00:01:01,834 --> 00:01:03,635
NECESSARILY LIKE HIM SAY AMERICA

25
00:01:03,636 --> 00:01:06,638
IS THE STRONGEST ECONOMY IN THE

26
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:07,639
WORLD.

27
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,510
JESSE: LOOK AT SOME OF THESE

28
00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:11,843
NUMBERS.

29
00:01:11,844 --> 00:01:14,579
STEEL WORKERS GETTING A 14%

30
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:14,913
RAISE.

31
00:01:14,914 --> 00:01:16,948
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THIS BEST

32
00:01:16,949 --> 00:01:21,019
CITY FOR JOBS RIGHT NOW, WE ARE

33
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,122
TALKING PITTSBURGH, ST. LOUIS,

34
00:01:24,123 --> 00:01:26,625
INDIANAPOLIS, CINCINNATI,

35
00:01:26,626 --> 00:01:28,994
HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT.

36
00:01:28,995 --> 00:01:31,363
LOOK AT THESE TOWNS ACROSS

37
00:01:31,364 --> 00:01:32,264
AMERICA.

38
00:01:32,265 --> 00:01:35,600
THIS IS A WIDE SWATH OF SUCCESS

39
00:01:35,601 --> 00:01:40,672
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT BLUE COLLAR,

40
00:01:40,673 --> 00:01:43,575
MIDDLE CLASS JOBS.

41
00:01:43,576 --> 00:01:45,010
>> DEMOCRATS FORGOT ABOUT THE

42
00:01:45,011 --> 00:01:46,244
RUST BELT AND THEY DID

43
00:01:46,245 --> 00:01:47,879
EVERYTHING THEY COULD TO

44
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,948
UNDERMINE THE RUST BELT.

45
00:01:49,949 --> 00:01:53,084
THEY TOOK ON THE TEAL WORKERS

46
00:01:53,085 --> 00:01:56,087
AND COAL WORKERS.

47
00:01:56,088 --> 00:01:58,290
THE COMPANIES THAT WERE

48
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,291
SHUTTERED AND CLOSED.

49
00:01:59,292 --> 00:02:01,893
THEY ALL WENT OVERSEAS.

50
00:02:01,894 --> 00:02:05,096
THEY WENT TO MEXICO AND CHINA.

51
00:02:05,097 --> 00:02:08,366
WE REBUILT THOSE COUNTRIES AT

52
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:10,234
BEHEST OF THE AMERICAN WORKER.

53
00:02:10,235 --> 00:02:14,472
YOU HAVE 3.7% UNEMPLOYMENT.

54
00:02:14,473 --> 00:02:16,141
MORE AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND

55
00:02:16,142 --> 00:02:21,479
HISPANICS AND FEMALES HE REPLIED

56
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,115
THAN ANY TIME IN HISTORY.

57
00:02:24,116 --> 00:02:25,784
THEY HAVE BENEFITS AND THE

58
00:02:25,785 --> 00:02:28,486
COUNTRY IS DOING AMAZINGLY WELL.

59
00:02:28,487 --> 00:02:30,989
WE ARE THE ENVY OF THE REST OF

60
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,324
THE WORLD.

61
00:02:32,325 --> 00:02:34,526
AND HERE YOU HAVE OBAMA SAYING A

62
00:02:34,527 --> 00:02:37,162
FEW YEARS AGO, WHO IS TRUMP

63
00:02:37,163 --> 00:02:41,499
GOING TO MAGICALLY -- WE NEED

64
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,936
MORE BUSINESS PEOPLE IN

65
00:02:44,937 --> 00:02:45,337
WASHINGTON.

66
00:02:45,338 --> 00:02:49,174
JESSE: TRUMP IS LIKE HE KILLA,

67
00:02:49,175 --> 00:02:52,811
HE ALWAYS WINS.

68
00:02:52,812 --> 00:02:57,482
-- IS LIKE TEQUILLA, HE ALWAYS

69
00:02:57,483 --> 00:02:59,851
WINS.

70
00:02:59,852 --> 00:03:04,856
YOUR FATHER SAYS POKE

71
00:03:04,857 --> 00:03:04,889
YOUR FATHER SAYS POCE

72
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,024
YOUR FATHER SAYS POCAHONTAS.

73
00:03:06,025 --> 00:03:10,228
SHE IS 1/1000 POSSIBLY NATIVE

74
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,595
AMERICAN.

75
00:03:10,596 --> 00:03:12,330
THIS IS WHAT YOUR FATHER HAD TO

76
00:03:12,331 --> 00:03:14,399
SAY ABOUT HER.

77
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,769
LET'S ROLL IT.

78
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:22,807
>> SHE OWES THE COUNTRY AN

79
00:03:22,808 --> 00:03:23,141
APOLOGY.

80
00:03:23,142 --> 00:03:27,579
WHAT'S THE PERCENTAGE?

81
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:27,912
1/1000?

82
00:03:27,913 --> 00:03:31,783
>> I DON'T HAVE THE PERCENTAGE.

83
00:03:31,784 --> 00:03:35,820
PRESIDENT TRUMP: IF SHE GETS THE

84
00:03:35,821 --> 00:03:37,322
NOMINATION, I WILL ONLY DO IT IF

85
00:03:37,323 --> 00:03:39,157
I CAN TEST HER PERSONALLY.

86
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:40,825
THAT WILL NOT BE SOMETHING I

87
00:03:40,826 --> 00:03:46,264
ENJOY DOING, EITHER.

88
00:03:46,265 --> 00:03:50,468
>> IT'S SUBSTANTIALLY WORSE THAN

89
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:51,169
THAT.

90
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:55,974
SHE IS WRITING POWWOW CHOW

91
00:03:55,975 --> 00:03:57,108
COOKBOOKS.

92
00:03:57,109 --> 00:03:59,778
JESSE: SHE HAS A COOKBOOK,

93
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:00,845
POWWOW CHOW.

94
00:04:00,846 --> 00:04:04,549
AND SHE CALLS HERSELF A CHEROKEE

95
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,551
INDIAN IN THE COOKBOOK.

96
00:04:06,552 --> 00:04:08,053
ACCORDING TO THE WASHINGTON POST

97
00:04:08,054 --> 00:04:11,056
A LOT OF THESE SO-CALLED RECIPES

98
00:04:11,057 --> 00:04:14,426
LOOKS LIKE THEY WERE LIFTED FROM

99
00:04:14,427 --> 00:04:17,162
OTHER RECIPE BOOKS.

100
00:04:17,163 --> 00:04:21,466
>> SHE PLAGIARIZED THE BOOK AND

101
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:24,669
BLANK RISED HERB OWN DNA.

102
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,271
GIVE ME A BREAK.

103
00:04:26,272 --> 00:04:29,741
YOU ARE 1/1000.

104
00:04:29,742 --> 00:04:32,677
YOU ARE LESS NATIVE AMERICAN

105
00:04:32,678 --> 00:04:36,815
THAN I AM.

106
00:04:36,816 --> 00:04:41,052
JESSE: I WAS .1% BLACK.

107
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:44,122
IMAGINE IF I WENT AROUND TELLING

108
00:04:44,123 --> 00:04:46,591
EVERYBODY I WAS BLACK?

109
00:04:46,592 --> 00:04:54,299
>> EVEN THE CHEROKEE INDIANS SAY

110
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,500
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

111
00:04:55,501 --> 00:04:58,236
SHE WAS USING IT AS A WAY TO

112
00:04:58,237 --> 00:05:00,772
ADVANCE HER CAREER AND GET A

113
00:05:00,773 --> 00:05:02,240
BETTER JOB.

114
00:05:02,241 --> 00:05:04,709
JESSE: ALL THE LEFT-WING PRESS,

115
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,178
ARTICLE AFTER ARTICLE, SHE SHOT

116
00:05:07,179 --> 00:05:09,481
HERSELF IN THE FOOT, SHE IS NOT

117
00:05:09,482 --> 00:05:11,383
A SERIOUS CANDIDATE ANYMORE.

118
00:05:11,384 --> 00:05:13,551
IT'S WIDELY ACCEPTED SHE IS NOT

119
00:05:13,552 --> 00:05:16,688
GOING TO GET THE DEMOCRATIC

120
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:17,088
NOMINATION.

121
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:18,390
IT'S TOO BAD BECAUSE SHE WOULD

122
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:21,226
HAVE MADE A GREAT OPPONENT FOR

123
00:05:21,227 --> 00:05:22,293
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

124
00:05:22,294 --> 00:05:24,529
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CARAVAN.

125
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,899
THE AP IS REPORTING THE CARAVAN

126
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,968
HEADING NORTH TOWARDS OUR

127
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:31,936
SOUTHERN BORDER HAS ALLEGEDLY

128
00:05:31,937 --> 00:05:32,937
BEEN TURNED AROUND.

129
00:05:32,938 --> 00:05:34,873
I KNOW YOUR FATHER SAID HE WAS

130
00:05:34,874 --> 00:05:37,475
GOING TO CUT OFF AID AND SEND

131
00:05:37,476 --> 00:05:38,777
THE MILITARY.

132
00:05:38,778 --> 00:05:40,545
THIS IS A BIG WIN.

133
00:05:40,546 --> 00:05:42,814
>> IT IS.

134
00:05:42,815 --> 00:05:44,883
HE TOLD THE COUNTRY WHERE PEOPLE

135
00:05:44,884 --> 00:05:46,317
ARE COMING FROM.

136
00:05:46,318 --> 00:05:48,386
WE GIVE YOU A LOT OF FINANCIAL

137
00:05:48,387 --> 00:05:48,653
AID.

138
00:05:48,654 --> 00:05:49,521
AND GUESS WHAT?

139
00:05:49,522 --> 00:05:50,989
WE ARE NOT GIVING YOU THAT AID

140
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,558
IF YOU DON'T FAKE CARE OF THIS

141
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:54,125
PROBLEM.

142
00:05:54,126 --> 00:05:56,761
WE DON'T WANT TO INHERIT YOUR

143
00:05:56,762 --> 00:05:58,430
PROBLEM WHILE WE GIVE YOU AID.

144
00:05:58,431 --> 00:06:02,233
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE

145
00:06:02,234 --> 00:06:04,302
HAD A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH

146
00:06:04,303 --> 00:06:06,037
MEXICO IN A LONG TIME.

147
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:11,376
THEY ALWAYS THROW OUT TRUMP IS

148
00:06:11,377 --> 00:06:11,810
ANTI-HISPANIC.

149
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:13,478
TRUMP HAS AN UNBELIEVABLE

150
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:14,679
RELATIONSHIP WITH MEXICO.

151
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,917
JESSE: YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN

152
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:22,086
EUROPE WHEN THEY HAD ALL THE

153
00:06:22,087 --> 00:06:23,455
MIGRANTS FLOOD IN.

154
00:06:23,456 --> 00:06:25,223
IT'S SOMETHING MERKEL SAID SHE

155
00:06:25,224 --> 00:06:26,858
REGRETS.

156
00:06:26,859 --> 00:06:28,960
YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE THE SAME

157
00:06:28,961 --> 00:06:31,029
MISTAKE PRICE.

158
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,031
ROSIE O'DONNELL IS BACK.

159
00:06:33,032 --> 00:06:35,600
>> WHEN HE WAS ELECTED I WROTE

160
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:38,837
ON TWITTER WE SHOULD IMPOSE

161
00:06:38,838 --> 00:06:41,339
MARTIAL LAW UNTIL WE ARE SURE

162
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,175
THE RUSSIANS WEREN'T INVOLVED IN

163
00:06:44,176 --> 00:06:44,776
THE VOTE.

164
00:06:44,777 --> 00:06:47,545
>> HE WANTS TO SEND THE MILITARY

165
00:06:47,546 --> 00:06:48,646
TO THE BORDER.

166
00:06:48,647 --> 00:06:50,248
>> I WANT TO SEND THE MILITARY

167
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:52,917
TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

168
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:54,986
JESSE: COULD YOU IMAGINE IF YOU

169
00:06:54,987 --> 00:06:56,421
HAD SAID ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP

170
00:06:56,422 --> 00:06:58,323
WE SHOULD SEND THE MILITARY TO

171
00:06:58,324 --> 00:07:00,525
THE WHITE HOUSE AND TAKE HIM

172
00:07:00,526 --> 00:07:00,792
OUT?

173
00:07:00,793 --> 00:07:01,626
>> GAME OVER.

174
00:07:01,627 --> 00:07:06,431
>> SHE APPEARS EVERY TWO MONTHS

175
00:07:06,432 --> 00:07:08,132
AND EMBARRASSES HERSELF.

176
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:12,937
THEN SHE REAPPEARS AND EMBARRASS

177
00:07:12,938 --> 00:07:13,271
HERSELF.

178
00:07:13,272 --> 00:07:17,242
IT'S LIKE A GAME OF

179
00:07:17,243 --> 00:07:21,212
WHACK-A-MOLE.

180
00:07:21,213 --> 00:07:23,081
THIS COUNTRY DESPITE THE

181
00:07:23,082 --> 00:07:26,351
NONSENSE AND NOISE AND RHETORIC,

182
00:07:26,352 --> 00:07:29,020
THIS COUNTRY IS DOING SO WELL.

183
00:07:29,021 --> 00:07:30,989
AMERICA HAS NEVER DONE BETTER.

184
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,024
BY EVERY METRIC, WE ARE

185
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:33,424
CRUSHING.

186
00:07:33,425 --> 00:07:35,193
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF THESE PEOPLE

187
00:07:35,194 --> 00:07:36,494
GOT ON BOARD?

188
00:07:36,495 --> 00:07:39,397
WE MIGHT DIFFER ON THIS THING.

189
00:07:39,398 --> 00:07:40,565
BUT LET'S PUSH FORWARD.

190
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:42,767

195
00:07:51,644 --> 00:07:55,213
BECAUSE THERE IS SUCH

196
00:07:55,214 --> 00:07:57,115

PEOPLE AREN'T INTO THIS STUFF.
