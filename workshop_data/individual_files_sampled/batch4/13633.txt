one of the great fantasies of the left is that if the older generation simply dies off all their policy goals will be achieved in 2013 oprah winfrey mused after two elections of president obama that it might require older white americans to die for america to achieve racial progress she said there are still generations of people older people who are born and bred and marinated in that prejudice and racism and they just have to die now bill nye bill nye the purported science guy is thinking along the same track he told the LA Times on Wednesday quote climate change deniers by way of example are older it's generational we're going to have to wait out for these people to age out if they say age out is a euphemism for die but it'll happen I guarantee you that'll happen that's true death does happen so these musings are not only pathetically immoral they are anti-democratic the notion behind a representative Republic is that people can be convinced on the issues if na hasn't convinced people that global warming is a catastrophic threat requiring massively burdensome government interference that would be his fault perhaps he's too busy producing songs about my sex junk or cartoons with polysexual ice cream scoops but the fantasy of the left is that the demographics of the country will move in their direction if they can just get rid of undesirable populations and that has a pretty dark undertone hoping your political opponents croak so that you can win legislative battles without having to win the argument and its massive nastiness while conservatives sometimes joke about leftist having fewer babies and then losing the argument through demographics we're not actually rooting for that to happen nor do we think that lack of kids from left this would be a necessity for political victory but on the left the hatred for those old white Americans is pretty real and it's one of the driving factors behind that constituencies hard turn toward candidates like President Trump I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show all righty so we are going to get to everything that is happening over at UC Berkeley I'll give you the update on that I'm going to give you the

design apt to do and I get a notice from young America's Foundation that UC Berkeley is now attempting to quash my appearance on September 14 so they have gotten back to ya and they are now saying that they are not going to allow me to speak there on September 14th have the facilities this was their excuse they always have to come up with an excuse they can't just say he's conservative we're not going to have him instead what they do is they make an excuse so according to you app in an email to the the Berkeley College Republicans Dean of Students Joseph green well and student organization coordinator Millicent Morris Cheney denied the student's request for a venue for September 14 2017 despite what Morris training called extensive efforts Berkeley has explained earlier that I was welcome on their campus and they were committed to supporting my right to free speech the administrator said that Brooklyn can only host make quote when events are held at a time and location that allow for the provision of any required security measures that's pretty open-ended they did not provide alternative dates nor do they provide alternative venues when UF asked for excuses meaning like can you give us all of the people who are speaking in the venues that have over 500 seats that night Berkeley apparently didn't even provide that so right now what it looks like is Berkeley making an excuse for not hosting me on September 14th and offering no alternative date now Berkeley says they're going to accommodate they say that they are going to offer alternative dates or they're going to allow us maybe to rent a different room but they're going to have to do that otherwise they're going to be hit with another lawsuit because the fact is that the Bruin College Republicans yeah I we all have a right to speak on the campus they're a duly a duly appointed student group they went through all the usual measures there is nothing wrong with me speaking at UC Berkeley in fact the proof is in the pudding I spoke there in April 2016 at no problem we had a packed room about 300 students no protesters nothing so if Berkeley doesn't actually get out of the way here or provide the security necessary to quash their identified insane people then they would be in violation of the First Amendment this is one of the excuses the left is fond of using now they don't openly say that they won't have conservative speakers instead what they do is they use the hecklers veto so they say okay well if there's going to be a bunch of violent people who show up and make trouble then we have to ensure safety and so we have to cancel the event outright which gives the veto to the worst people on earth that gives the veto to those Antipa thugs the what it really incentivizes is a bunch of people on the right to do the same thing the left-wing speaker's right go out there and threaten violence the left-wing speakers get canceled it's horrible precedent it's really bad now I thought something was really funny there's somebody who tweeted me yesterday and they said well now that Berkeley's trying to quash you to upset with yourself that you didn't support the people who stormed the stage and Shakespeare in the Park I said no I'm happy I did not support those people since they have the exact same rights that I do I mean it's a very very easy one if I have the right to speak in a public place like Berkeley then they have the right to perform at a stage that they have the new ability to perform it but I think these principles have to be held consistently again I'm hopeful that Berkeley will work it out I'm hopeful that Berkeley will hear the hue and cry that has arisen from the masses and that they will back down off of this and they will not allow themselves to be intimidated by the Antipa people but there are measures available in case Berkeley does not do what Berkeley is supposed to do and if they want to read that as a legal threat they certainly should because there will be legal action if they do not do what they are necessitated to do under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution also Governor Brown Governor Jerry Brown of this used to be great state of California I would appreciate if you would get control of your own campuses University of California is under the auspices of the California state government when the when Berkeley was filled with riots in the 1960s Ronald Reagan sent in the National Guard if Jerry Brown allows Berkeley to continue being a place where free speech is shut down he is just demonstrating that he is wildly incompetent to his job and or helping out the worst form of anti speech fascism in America that is happening on today's college campuses so I'll continue to bring you updates as all this develops I mean honestly perfectly so stupid for doing this I'm supposed to testify in front of Congress next week next week about government shutdowns of free speech on college campuses so I guess thanks to Berkeley for providing me material so welcome there guys but we will bring you updates as those arises okay in other news from President Trump yesterday had an interview with the New York Times and President Trump should not do these interviews of the New York Times it's really funny because for all the talk about Trump destroys the media no one gives the media more fodder than President Trump right he goes and he does these interviews Maggie Haberman of the New York Times I think Maggie Haberman is quite a good reporter but Trump obviously desires the love of Maggie Haberman in the New York Times because he does interviews with her regularly routinely he does interviews with with the New York Times because he reads the New York Times because he grew up in New York and he subscribed I'm sure it's in the New York Times and so he's interested in what they have to say he dropped bunch of bombshells in the middle of this interview that are just not helpful it's it's really bad that Trump is is you know I don't know that he's a stupid man but I will say that he is a guy who really does not listen to what he says he has you know if the Trump family sort of the Bluth family in interested development then I have I mean he's played all of the different blues parts at one point or another you know he's played the right and the Democrats think that he is George senior right I may have committed a little light treason that's what the Democrats think of it you know sometimes he plays the the Trump jr. kind of Joe Bluth part I've made a horrible mistake right now he's playing I think that he's actually playing Tobias Tobias team K and the reason that I say that is because Tobias his whole problem throughout the entire series that he says ridiculous things that he can't hear himself rightly good and then if he's confronted with tape he still can't hear it so he'll say things that are complete gay sexual connotations and everyone around him here is it but he doesn't hear it because he's incapable of hearing so I feel like that's what Trump does sometimes because if you were a Democrat and he said you know the awesome was would be a trump said X within 48 hours Trump will be out there saying that thing and he won't even like understand that he's saying it's really it's really a mix it you know Trump says things that are honest and some things that are true and he says whatever comes to his mind first and so you know that's not a good thing today actually is a perfect day for good Trump bathroom so we have access to good Trump bad Trump all righty so we'll get to good Trump in a little bit but we'll start with a drum so Trump does this interview with the New York Times and he starts off by saying that he would never have picked Jeff Sessions for attorney general if he had known that sections was going to recuse himself the reason that this is intensely stupid is because if you want to suggest to people that you are trying to cover up some sort of crime with Russia what you don't do is say I really wish I had an attorney general who hadn't recused himself so he could protect me from the investigation into Russia this would be the thing that you wouldn't say so naturally Trump being tobias funke just says it and doesn't even really understand what he's saying so here he is - Don Olsen's analyst therapist gets the job right after he gets the job he reduces was that a mistake well section should have never accused himself and if he what if he was going to recuse himself he should have told me before he took the job and I want to pick somebody else zero so Jeff Sessions takes the job gets into the job refuses themselves I didn't have which which frankly I think it's very unfair to the president how do you take a job and then reduce yourself if he would have recused himself before the job I would have said thanks Jeff but I can't you know another thing it's extremely unfair and that's a mile board to the president so he refuses okay so clearly Trump is very upset about him refusing himself over to the Russia thing so to be fair to Trump the fact is the Barack Obama used Eric Holder as his shield and sword the entirety of his administration he called Barack Holder called Barack Obama his wing man they said they're like best buddies these two hang out and obviously anytime Holder needed to protect be protected when he was in contempt of Congress Obama stepped in asserted executive privilege to protect him so it's not unwarranted the Trump thinks the AG is supposed to be sort of his protector but it's not good right you're now suggesting that he that there's something that is really terrible that's going to happen because AG sessions recused himself on Russia and by the way AG sessions a very active Attorney General is there really ratcheted up prosecutions on immigration he's done some things that are not so good either like yesterday he came out and he really ratcheted up the idea of asset forfeiture asset forfeiture is this unconstitutional notion that if you arrest somebody and you don't even charge them then you can just seize their property which is really quite awful but his sessions a very active AG his job is not entirely the Russian investigation if Trump is saying that the sole qualifiers here was going to be that the AG was not able to investigate the Russia thing and that he would have left sessions at McCole if you had known that what it's going to suggest to people is that you wish that sessions were there to protect you right now I don't know if that's what Trump wishes but that's certainly the connotation of what he is suggesting okay then he goes further with this he says you know I really would prefer if Robert Muller who is the special prosecutor he shouldn't look into my family's finances okay this is again remember Robert Muller was only appointed not because AG sessions recused himself but sessions recused himself and then Trump fired Comey in order to fire Comey if you remember the former FBI director in order to fire economy he requested a letter from rod Rosenstein who is the Deputy Attorney General Sessions couldn't write the letter supposedly because he was recused on the Russia stuff she had rod Rosenstein write the letter now rod Rosenstein is involved in the firing of coaming and so now when Comey comes back at Trump and he says you fired me is basically part of a cover-up on the Russia stuff now Rosenstein has to recuse himself and that's how you get the special prosecutor Robert Muller who Rosenstein appointed Trump is now angry at Rosenstein because he says Rosenstein is a Democrat he's angry at sessions and he's very angry at Muller because he thinks special prosecutor is going to exceed his mandate which by the way he's not wrong about Muller is going to exceed his mandate I'll discuss that in a second but what Trump says here is so not smart it's just not smart again it's Tobias fume k it's somebody saying something that he doesn't hear and not good always looking at your finances your family's fine unrelated to Russia is that a red line but that'd be a breach of what is actual I was hurrying yeah I would say is by the way I would say I don't I don't I mean it's possible to condo or something so you know sell a lot of kind of units and somebody somebody from Russia by Spandau knows I don't make money from Russia in fact I put out a letter saying that I don't know from one of the most highly respected law firms accounting firms I don't have buildings in Russia they said I owned buildings and in Russia I don't they said I made money from Russia it's not my thing I don't I don't do that over the years I've looked at maybe doing the deal in Russia but a net he did okay so he continued by saying that it was it was a violation of redline and then he said at the very end he said they said would you fire Muller if he crosses that red line he said I can't I can't answer that question because I don't think that it's going to happen okay so first of all here's the thing you shouldn't say you can investigate everything but whatever you do don't look in that safe right this is not the way that you're supposed to if you want to avoid an investigation and this is unless you're Lex Luthor and you actually hit the Kryptonite inside the lead in Koston coat in encased box and you're actually trying to get Superman to open the box you don't actually want to say this right this is like the police the police come in your apartment they say can we search your apartments they absolutely can search my apartment just don't search under the floorboards in my closet like what do you think is the first place that are going to search obviously what do you think is the very first place they're going to search this is the place they're going to search obviously so it's really not particularly smart for Trump to say don't look at my sign-out yeah look everywhere but whatever you do don't look at the finances just don't do it I'd be mad if you do it again where do you think Muller is going to look now and naturally this morning there's a report out if Bob Muller where is he looking oh yes at Trump's finances quote do you have special counsel investigating possible ties between Donald Trump campaign in Russia in last year's election is examining a broad range of transactions involving Trump's business as well as those of his associates according to a person familiar with the probe FBI investigators and others are looking at Russian purchases of apartments and Trump buildings Trump's involvement in a Contra personal SOHO development with Russian associates the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow and Trump sale of a Florida mansion to a Russian oligarch in 2008 the person said so I want to discuss what Trump is right about here and what he's wrong about cuz he's not entirely wrong I think that this is going to end with Trump firing Muller I think this is going to get to the point where Trump gets so annoyed that he just fires Muller and it will be really fascinating to see what happens next but I think that it will be but I don't mean that he's entirely wrong be suspicious of what Molitor is doing I'll explain that in just a second but before I do that I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at my Patriot supply so the fact is that in any situation natural disaster or terrorist attack economic collapse any bad situation people tend to panic and when people panic they go to the grocery store they buy off the shelves and there's no food and there's disaster preparedness in other words it's something that you and your family deserve here in California earthquakes they recommend that you're supposed to have food on hand water on hand your flashlights your ray-ray all these things are supposed to have most people don't have them this is true across the country you should certainly be prepared in case there's some sort of disaster that necessitates you have some emergency food storage so right now if you go over my friends and my Patriots apply and get their new survival food supply for just $99 it includes a hundred and two servings of breakfast lunch lunches and dinner for less than a dollar per serving order now 888 803 1413 888 803 1413 or online and prepare with been calm again it's 99 bucks for one hundred and two servings so it's a great price prepare with Ben calm you by sticking your quasi forget about it until you need it but then you're the only one who's prepared prepare with Ben calm and that way you know that if there's something bad that happens you're always going to be confident you can handle at 888 803 1413 or prepare with Ben comm 102 servings I mean that means that you're going to be able to feed your family for weeks so that's that's a fantastic deal again it's something that every family should have and people at the office here of Trident they say that it tastes like home cooking so it's actually good it doesn't taste like garbage tastes really good apparently so go over to prepare with Ben comm 888 803 14:13 and get your emergency food supply just in case something bad should happen 99 bucks is not a is not a high price for peace of mind okay so here is where Trump is right about robert muller and the entire left is suggesting how dare trump how dare he even suggest all these things ok so annie mccarthy has a really good piece today over at the journal of american greatness which is basically the trump defense journal but Annie McCarthy is an honest thinker so this is not just a knee-jerk Trump defense piece and he says that the problem with the special counsel he's been saying this all along is that the investigation that Muller is now engaging in is too broad ranging to actually pick up on the original mandate you remember the original mandate was to investigate whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians in cyber hacking the DNC and then releasing emails that was the original mandate it is now expanded to include trumps finances Trump's associates you could see a case certainly where Muller investigates and he goes into Trump's finances and you find something totally unrelated to Russia that's criminal or a problem and that ends up being the scandal that takes down Trump once you have a special counsel these sorts of things happen is exactly what happened with Kenneth Starr remember Monica Lewinsky never claimed sexual harassment Monica Lewinsky never claimed sexual assault Monica Lewinsky was a consensual affair but that was uncovered by Kenneth Starr in the process of investigating the Paula Jones allegations and that in turn necessitated that Bill Clinton when he committed perjury was going to be impeached so this is the problem with special counsels and this is something that Andy McCarthy points out he suggests that in criminal law our sites are trained on conspiracy which makes things easy a conspiracies and agreement to commit a violation of law to speak in terms of collusion rather than conspiracy only confuses matters contrary to what you may have heard from strategists and analysts collusion is not a crime nor a term that has a legally consequential meaning so that's where we are with respect to the Trump Tower meeting but if there's an ordinary federal criminal case which is what Mulder would theoretically be investigating if there's no felony there's no cause to investigate but still we're investigating why because once you get into a Special Counsel investigation it broadens and broadens now I was in favor of appointing the special counsel originally simply because I felt the Trump had no choice at a certain point because so many people in his administration had been dirty by the Russia allegations sessions and then Rosenstein in the firing of Comey and it felt like his administration was losing enough faith that at certain point of special counsel was going to be appointed whether he liked it or not that's what's happened but now Trump is legitimately scared that something will be dug up on any grounds and if I were him I'd be scared too even if I were completely open and honest about the rush of stuff because once people start digging they did until they hit bedrock they're going to dig until they find something anything at all and and so that is probably why Trump is so is so upset about the Special Counsel stuff and probably why in the end he didn't end up firing the Special Counsel which could precipitate it's not a constitutional crisis his authority to do it but it could precipitate a major political scandal whereby Trump didn't even do anything and ends up in the crosshairs of the Democrats for impeachment through not really doing anything well want to explain more about this plus Trump does something on Russia again I'm going to I'm going to say that this is more to buy a

Trump again I think he says things without thinking about them that can be read in two ways one is that's completely innocent tobias fume k is not in fact an anal rapist he's an analyst therapist right and then there it could be read in like the most awful a possible way so Trump last night he's asked about this second Putin meeting so the media's been making a big deal out of the fact that at this big dinner there was this big dinner with all of the g20 leaders and their spouses and from halfway through the dinner his wife is sitting apparently next to Melania is sitting next to Putin he is sitting next to the first lady of Japan and he gets bored and he walks over and he sits down next to Melania and Putin and proceeds to engage with them he said it was a brief meeting everybody there says it was like an hour and nobody from the US government was there so we don't know what was said we only know what Trump says was that I think by the way the funniest thing about this this is Italy funny is that apparently the first lady of Japan when sitting next to trump in his interview with the New York Times you said yeah I was sitting there next to her and she didn't really speak English people didn't speak it turns out she's fluent in English so she was legitimately apparently pretending not to speak English and she would not have to talk to Trump which is it that's money again sorry as it's really funny because he sits down next to Melania Putin and people are saying what are you talking about for an hour and Trump uses legitimately the worst excuse available he says I talked about Russian adoption with Vladimir Putin that's what we talked about for an hour or dessert I went that just to say hello to Melania and while I was near said a little food really pleasantries more than anything else was that a long conversation but it's no could be 15 minutes just talk about things we actually is very interesting we talked about production he did Russian touch yeah I always found that interesting because you know he ended that years ago and I actually talked about Russian adoption with them which is interesting because that was a part of the conversation that Don had with us meaning that I think as I said most people you know when they call they say by the way we have information on your opponent I think most politicians just with a lot of people they said you taking a meeting like common well no no you don't do that okay so here's why you don't do that Donald Trump's original excuse about the meeting with the Russians that it was about Russian adoption and turned out that was bull now Trump is being asked what was your meeting about he uses the exact same excuse his son used that turned out to be bull can't you make up anything else say the weather our kids jiu-jitsu riding horses bareback fighting bears bathing an antler blood which apparently Putin does do any of those things right you can do any of those things but instead you go directly to the excuse that your son used that turned out to be false within 48 hours why why God waffling president Trump please for the love of God please just no just there are things called teleprompters okay I understand you don't like using them but you're so much better when you use the teleprompter he's given some great speeches on teleprompter he spoke in front of a joint session of Congress terrific on teleprompter he spoke in Saudi Arabia not my favorite speech not a bad speech on teleprompter right spoke in Poland terrific speech on teleprompter he does not have a teleprompter for these interviews his lawyers must just be thinking oh god oh god he's going to talk to the New York Times again no no no don't do it please don't do it okay and then Trump follows this up by saying Jim Comey tried to blackmail me okay so he his suggestion is that Jim Comey basically was trying to was trying to coerce him into doing something but isn't it clear what it is that Comey wanted to hear his Trump he also had some really fascinating choice word for a former FBI director Comey he sure did and as we know he has said any number of choice words James Comey for some time but he was very specific that he you know believed that Comey was trying to essentially get leverage over him with that dossier making all sorts of wild allegations about President Trump and his appearance in Russia in 2013 you know he as we know he was not happy with Comey for quite some time long before he actually fired him there had been some belief that he might even fire him immediately upon taking office he believes Comey did that in order to get leverage over him to keep his job essentially the company wanted to keep his job and that that was the point in showing it to him you know again the the president feels sort of indicated as I think you have seen him say publicly that Comey had to acknowledge under oath that he had told the president three times that he was under investigation he said he would not say that publicly because it might change the president just doesn't accept that as an answer no soon Comey is political actor no question but when he says that Comey was trying to blackmail him with the dossier we have to go back in history originally what Comey said is I presented this dossier you remember BuzzFeed released the dossier which is full of false information about Russian P tapes and stuff about trumping P down by processes and all that sort of nonsense and Comey said I presented that to the president because it was going around Capitol Hill I wanted him to be aware of it I wanted him to be aware that it was being investigated and that we had no proof that any of it was true and now Trump is saying that that was supposed to be leverage like that was going to be released by Comey he doesn't have any proof of that and what it more looks like is again that he's in some sort of poop fight with Comey than that he's actually rightfully trying to defend himself there's two things that are happening here Trump can be completely innocent in all of this but he has to stop saying things that make him sound guilty and make him sound like he is he is getting involved in things he shouldn't be involved in so okay this is all under the heading bad Trump it is not useful it is harmful you should not speak off the cuff like this it is really not worthwhile okay now it's time for some good Trump at long last it's time for some good Trump so I criticize president Trump yesterday and the day before and I have for weeks that he has been completely hands-off on this health care thing he's been very hands-off on health care policy and it makes sense fitting hands-off on the health care policy because the truth is he doesn't know what he's talking about when it comes to health insurance policy if you asked him what's in the health insurance bill there is no one in America who thinks the Donald Trump is an expert on what is in Trump care part 1 part 2 part 3 what's in Obamacare what all these things do in fact there's a poll out today that shows that nearly two-thirds of Americans 62% now think that the federal government's job is to ensure that all Americans have health care coverage if they all agree with Bernie Sanders two percent that would include President Trump back in January said quote we're going to have insurance for everybody there was a philosophy in some circles that if you can't pay for it you don't get it that's not going to happen with us I mean that's what Trump actually said so he buys into that as well and that confusion as I have said has led to the inability of a lot of Republicans to come to a conclusion on what exactly Trump even wants them to do and so that's been a problem Trump is now attempting a little too late he's trying to apply leverage to some of the senators to vote for something I am glad that he is attempting to apply leverage the big problem is that if you apply leverage without knowing what you're trying to leverage people into it makes it sort of difficult so here is what Trump is doing that is right he's trying to apply leverage yesterday he had a bunch of senators to the White House and he started getting rough with them on camera and here's what it looked like we can repeal but we should repeal and replace and we shouldn't leave town until this is complete until this bill is on my desk and until we all go over to the Oval Office I'll sign it and we can celebrate for the American people thank you very much thank you thank you okay so he then continued along these lines by openly threatening senator Heller senator Dean Heller from the state of Nevada is a moderate he does not believe in full repeal basically or at least he's made noises along those lines and from actively warned Heller if you don't do what I want then you might not be a senator for very long I think I have to get him back that's right I color City Nick what I want to stay you didn't go out there this was the one we were worried about you are there but you're going to be you're going to do it look he wants to remain a senator doesn't he okay and I think the people of your state which I know very well I think they're going to appreciate what you hopefully will do it looks like I just want to crawl in a hole and die but here's here's okay so it's good that Trump's applying pressure well it'd be better is a trump applying pressure toward a particular actual standard so the problem is this let's say that you are a congress person your senator and you're presented with a bill and the bill contains some good stuff and it contains some bad stuff what do you do do you vote for it or do you vote against it now Trump might like the bill but he also might not so you might say okay you vote for it because Trump is going to use his leverage as I have been suggesting he should do he's going to use his leverage to harm me if I don't do what he wants right that would be the idea except that a bunch of Republicans voted in the house in favor of Trump care part-1 and Trump had a big celebratory meeting at the White House and then three days later he came out and said that the bill was mene mene mene why would you put yourself on the line with your own constituents to vote for an unpopular bill that has 20 percent approval rating under the auspices the president's going to pressure you if you know that he's going to stab you in the back a minute everything goes out so the president in order for threat to work if I threatened if I were to threaten mathis virus a Malthus if you do something if you do X I'm going to fire you I have to define what X is right so that Malthus knows not to do it if I were to save Malthus you have to make me look good on the show or I'm going to fire you then it's Amathus his job to make me look good on the show there's only so much he can do but he does the best that he can if I were to say to if I were to say to Malthus however Malthus do some stuff but I'm going to fire you some stuff and it's going to get done or you may not have a job tomorrow Malthus may not sleep particularly well but Malthus is not going to know what the hell to do right does he is he supposed to use the camera in a particular way he's supposed to cut to a particular question she's supposed to make sure that all the clips are cut to their specified length what is he supposed to do he doesn't know in order for a threat to work you have to have a natural a natural action and then a consequence to that action right if you do X I will do Y what's the X here some sense repeal in our place that's super vague because they're not going to pass a pure repeal it appears it appears that they don't the votes for this Lamar Alexander the senator from Tennessee he says we don't have 40 votes to just repeal Obamacare I'll explain why this is the case in a second but here with Lamar Alexander from Tennessee saying exactly this better than the time but it's obvious to me number one with the president papers their deal in the place of course we can't repeal at all we're repealing parts of the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with parts we think will improve it and I said that sucks that's the main thing III favors you want to forget to you any favor that I favor that you I don't think there forty votes to repeal and say to the American people well trust us to come up with something in the next couple of years I don't think that's a very very clearly what do you think the Republicans are not going to just repeal so the plan from McConnell was we're going to repeal Obamacare and then we'll figure out something to do is that the problem is twofold one the actual repeal bill from 2015 doesn't repeal all of Obamacare even plain repeal I think they should vote on it because I think that they need pressure put on them to actually come up with a full repeal but the what the actual repeal bill did in remember they can only do what's called reconciliations and backtrack reconciliation process means that you need 51 votes in order to pass something reconciliation means that you can only pass a law that has an impact on the budget that's just these arcane Senate rules okay if you don't need 60 votes to invoke cloture you only need 51 in order to pass a bill the bill has to impact the budget the problem is the regular bamaca regulations don't actually impact the budget directly so it's kind of hard to use reconciliation in order to get rid of all of Obamacare you end up keeping a lot of the regulations but getting rid of the subsidies and the taxes that inevitably will kill the Obamacare exchanges but these insurance companies are still required to cover pre-existing conditions which is going to drive premiums up that's what Republicans are afraid of that's why a lot of them don't want to vote for pure repeal the case in favor of voting for pure repeal like this is that once you do that then you're going to be forced into a position where either you pass a bunch of regulatory reform and do away with a lot of these regulations or all the prices go up it applies a certain amount of pressure but it's a gamble it's a gamble and a lot of people don't want to take that gamble because the premiums go up and people are tossed off of Medicaid then the number of uninsured go up and people who are still trying to get insurance might be in a fair bit of trouble so that's why there's a case against plain repeal in the 2015 census that could actually try to repeal Obamacare wholesale and then try to leverage the Senate Rules Committee the Senate rules there's actually a person who's like the rules expert who rules on this stuff try to pressure her to actually allow that to go through that would be the best available move but the Republicans are now stuck between a bit of a rock and a hard but when they say repeal and replace that's not clear what they mean it's like when people say immigration reform it's a buzzword it doesn't mean anything is immigration reform strengthening our immigration system or is it weakening our immigration system what does it mean to repeal and replace does it mean we're going to get rid of Obamacare or does it mean we're going to replace Obamacare with Obamacare part two and so this is why Trump even Trump is unclear on this the Republican caucus is unclear on this nobody knows what they want to do so when Trump tries to apply pressure to a caucus that doesn't know what it wants to do and he doesn't know what he wants to do you end up with this sort of wild confusion and you do end up with a fair bit of posturing so Mitch McConnell knowing that he's not going to be able to pass a plan repeal he said yesterday we're going to vote to wipe the slate clean of Obama care we will have a vote on this even if it doesn't pass as I announced last evening after consulting with both the White House and our members we've decided to hold the vote to open debate on Obamacare repeal to early next week the Obamacare repeal legislation will ensure a stable two-year transition period which will allow us to wipe the slate clean and start over with real patient center health care reform okay so we will see if that actually happens is that vote actually takes place if it does then it's at least in part an attempt by Mitch McConnell to simply get the Republican caucus off his back saying okay we tried to pass it and then we weren't actually able to pass it so that is what it is again this is because the Republican Party does not agree on what to do it doesn't agree on the means that it has available to do it and it can't even make the argument again this entire thing could have been avoided in two ways one if you're going to leave Obamacare in place you should have called the Democrats in from day one and said we want to fix all of this won't you help us and then the Democrats would say no need see we want to fix it they wouldn't help us right that was the first way to do this the second way to do this was to say we want to repeal the entire thing wholesale and we are going to work continuously to do that and then say okay we don't have the votes to do it give us more votes repet to do this sort of repeal and replace routine where it's all bollixed up and you don't know what your goals are you'll end up in a bad position and instead what you're going to end up with is democrats claiming that you are the scourge of the world which is what democrats like Cory Booker are doing the senator from New Jersey says it's all sinister and evil it's just terrible terrible terrible I mean that's not just cynical it's actually sinister here is a guy that promised can consistently that he was hey only I can fix this that I'm taking on the guy that I'm going to make health care for everybody I'm going to get affordable oh it's going to be I think the word he used was terrific well he completely abdicated that responsibility that completely broken that promise he outsource this health care process to people like Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan and didn't even try to reach out to one Democrat in the Senate no call didn't call one Democrat didn't call us up to the White House to try to work with us a great deal maker failed to make a deal yeah and so now he's just saying that I'm going to imperil 30 million Americans if Obamacare fails it's not just people going to say hey policy doesn't just fail that means Americans will get hurt badly and you'll see very devastating things happen so that's not just a cynical way that's violating his promises that sinister it is in and it's evil Tuukka plot against Americans like that okay so this is a case that Democrats are going to make and Republican incompetent it's gonna be a little bit of a hard case but we will see you know how it works Daniel Horowitz has a piece today in which he talks about how to defang Obamacare even without full repeal and it's it's pretty good you should check it out over a conservative review he talked about cost-sharing associations and and and forcing people to post their prices on particular on particular cost so we can actually have some open competition all these are good idea there are lots of good ideas that can be brought to bear but Republicans have to decide what they want to do and Trump has to decide what he wants to push okay time for some things I like things I ate and then we'll do the big idea so so before we do that actually I first want to say thank you to our sponsors over at

sent you okay time for some things I like some things I hate and then the big idea so things I like so John McCain was diagnosed really tragically with brain cancer and a lot of scummy disgusting human beings are today tweeting out things like they're happy that he got brain cancer because they disagree with him politically okay first of all let it be said John McCain is not a terrorist supporter John McCain is not an evil person he's not somebody that you would shoot he's not somebody that it would be appropriate it was a douchey he's not evil man and you're not at war with him so stop with the crap about how you want John McCain to die okay what you would really prefer is for John McCain not to be elected right you'd prefer for John McCain not to be elected but that does not mean that you should be wishing death on a guy you disagree with and I disagree with John McCain on a lot of things a lot of things I thought campaign finance reform was terrible I think the Thomas foreign policy is not great but the the scummy people who are suggesting that John McCain ought to die just scum of the earth so today in honor of John McCain things I like faith of my father's is John McCain's autobiography and memoir all about his family and his time in Vietnam it's actually a really good book with with Mark Salter and it's shockingly good it's a shockingly good memoir which is which is me he wrote this back in I think 2000 so it's not from his presidential run in 2008 and he tells it really really well all the way through and from from his grandfather to his father to himself his being shot down over North Vietnam spending years in POWs counselor he was beaten nearly death tortured nearly allowed to die they offered him the out to come home because he was an admiral son if he would just help them with a propaganda he said no and it ends actually with McCain being released by the EDS appeal W it doesn't have anything after that so it's really more about his military career in his family's military career it's actually a really good book faith of my fathers John McCain an honorable man okay for all of the talk about his politics an honorable man who did amazing service for the United States it was you know he deserves our respect and our prayers okay speaking of POWs there's a movie if you don't want to watch the if you don't want to read the book there there's a they did make a movie version on A&E I think but I've never actually seen it so I can't recommend it but you want to watch a great movie about what it was like to be a Vietnam piw like an actual Vietnam POWs were a hertog made a very good film called rescue dawn with Christian Bale one of Christian Bale's Western own parts didn't do great business at the box office but is a very hard-nosed good film about what exactly happened and about an escape from Vietnam POWs camp came out in 2006 member seeing in theatres and being pretty struck by it here's a little bit the trailer tomorrow morning zero 500 hours we have to cross over into Laos now this is white with Chinese danglers first mission this is classified no one can know Oh why are you in this war against I never wanted to go to war I wanted to fly - I love America America gave me wings I will not sign it absolutely not here longer than people know two and a half year ago now two and a half years ago keep your head down your mouth shut your best chance of surviving you can run in here if you like but I'm gonna scram make that a camp without water doors five point in two days out there kachunk oldest to prison and they took quite a good film it's a little over long but it's really well shot and it's really well acted and and it's it's based on a true story I mean this is not a false story this is a true story and the other people in the a me can see from the traveling people were there for four years on end there was a lot of talk about whether POWs were still there after the end of the Vietnam War and and whether they were left there to dive and it's really a tragic story okay so time for some things that I hate okay so the as you know I'm a big Game of Thrones fan I think Game of Thrones is the best show on TV I don't think that it's particularly close and the only other competitor is probably man in the high castle which is really terrific from Amazon but David Benioff and DB Weiss we're the showrunners they have a new plan for a new series they want a helm for HBO it's an alternative history series titled Confederacy which it takes place in modern-day America with the south is separate from the north so it's basically man in the high castle alternative history where America is divided not by the Germans and the Japanese by the north and the south which is an interesting premise except for it's going to be really really annoying I'll bet it's pretty troubled and it can be very very annoying to read all the hot takes from the left about how the south in this show is really like the south of today how all the whites other of today a really Neil Confederates who wants his enslaved black folks okay polls show I've talked about this on the show before polls show that white folks across the country have a basically about the same level of racism regardless of party regardless of location there's no evidence to suggest that southerners are more hostile to black folks than northerners are at this point in time the history has moved beyond this and so I'm already preemptively hitting the hot takes less than the show itself I'm more preemptively hitting the hot takes themselves because that's going to be really irritating they're going to do exactly what they did with The Handmaid's Tale they're going to suggest that this is really about modern-day America it's not really about what would have happened it's about us we are secretly just like these people I mean is a compelling question what would have happened if the South had won the Civil War and it is my belief that within 20 to 25 years the South would have moved beyond slavery anyway because that's the direction the entire Western world was moving and by the 1880s slavery was outlawed in the vast majority of the Western world would have moves probably a South African apartheid system more than likely which is basically they had anyway under Jim Crow but you know thank God for the Civil War in the freeing of the slaves the great tragedy in the aftermath of the Civil War was not the Civil War itself it was that in 1876 the Federals pulled out and allowed the south to reimpose all these Jim Crow sanctions on black folks that that's a real tragedy that is yet to be told historically well that would be fascinating things about the loss of the Civil War after the winning of the Civil War in a particular way but I'm already just warning you about the hot cakes that are sure to come and that will be super annoying when you have a bunch of leftists who living who live in Beverly Hills and see a black person only if they cast a black person talking about how everybody down south is racist by the way the south is actually significantly more integrated than cities like Boston in the north okay one more thing I hate it we'll have to get big idea today because we just ran out of time but one more thing that I hate so as you know I am NOT a big fan of history I do not like citizen C I'm not a fan of it Chris Kobach is the the Secretary of he's a Kansas secretary of state and he works closely with the White House and he was asked about he's leading up Trump's voter fraud panel and here is what he had to say he was asked did Trump actually lose the popular vote and here was his Neela's answer easily celery Clinton won the popular vote by three to five million votes you know we may never know the answer that we will probably never know the answer to that question because even if you could prove that a certain number of votes were cast by ineligible voters for example that's why you wouldn't know is that 1:11 exists because the President believes that you would have won the popular vote I'm glad you asked that question because actually that's that is not the reason the Commission exists it's not to justify to validate or invalidate what the president said in December or damaged the Commission doesn't exist to evaluate or invalidate what the president says why don't you just say what everybody knows is true Trump lost the popular vote who cares he's the president stop it okay if you're going to do this routine where you don't know who voted for what then maybe Trump lost right if you were going to say that there was voter fraud you don't know who voted for what Trump's margin of victory in the three states that he won Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania right his margin of victory there was a hundred thousand votes it's a lot easier to make the claim that voter fraud is 100 thousand votes and that's one three million votes but again if all in favor of voter fraud Commission that looks into registration of people who are dead and people who are registered in more than one state I think that is a worthwhile thing to do what I do not think is a worthwhile thing to do is to place that on the tentative grounds and when I hit enter I mean baseless grounds the Trump actually won the popular vote that's just silly and there's no reason to do it okay we'll reactor tomorrow tomorrow we will have the mailbag and we will do that it should be awesome Mughal fulfill all of your life longings at that time i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show
