1
00:00:00,728 --> 00:00:03,664
CONGRESSMAN DUNCAN HUNTER,

2
00:00:03,665 --> 00:00:07,100
ATTORNEY GENERAL PAM BONDI AND

3
00:00:07,101 --> 00:00:07,401
MORE.

4
00:00:07,402 --> 00:00:09,303
BUT FIRST MY OPENING STATEMENT.

5
00:00:09,304 --> 00:00:11,705
THE RISE OF SOCIALISM HAS NEVER

6
00:00:11,706 --> 00:00:12,806
BEEN MORE CLEAR.

7
00:00:12,807 --> 00:00:15,142
RIGHT NOW IN AMERICA THERE ARE

8
00:00:15,143 --> 00:00:16,810
FORCES DUG IN, ORGANIZED AND

9
00:00:16,811 --> 00:00:19,313
WELL FUNDED, DOING WHATEVER IS

10
00:00:22,817 --> 00:00:24,751
TODAY'S DEMONSTRATIONS ARE PART

11
00:00:30,358 --> 00:00:31,491
ITS VERY CORE.

12
00:00:31,492 --> 00:00:34,294
THEY DEMAND THE ABOLITION OF

13
00:00:34,295 --> 00:00:36,797
I.C.E., IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS

14
00:00:36,798 --> 00:00:42,936
ENFORCEMENT, AND THE ZERO

15
00:00:42,937 --> 00:00:44,271
TOLERANCE POLICY OF THE TRUMP

16
00:00:44,272 --> 00:00:44,871
ADMINISTRATION.

17
00:00:44,872 --> 00:00:48,642
>> WE NEED TO ABOLISH I.C.E.

18
00:00:48,643 --> 00:00:50,444
THEY HAVE STRAYED FROM THE

19
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:51,878
INTEREST OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

20
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:53,814
AND HUMANITY.

21
00:00:53,815 --> 00:00:55,615
JUDGE JEANINE: ARE YOU STUPID?

22
00:00:55,616 --> 00:00:57,584
I KNOW AS AN ACTRESS YOU ARE

23
00:00:57,585 --> 00:00:59,686
USED TO SAYING WHAT IS ON THE

24
00:00:59,687 --> 00:01:00,887
SCRIPT AND THIS GOVERNMENT THING

25
00:01:00,888 --> 00:01:02,889
IS NEW TO YOU.

26
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:03,790
BUT STRAYED SO FAR FROM THE

27
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:04,958
INTERESTS OF THE AMERICAN

28
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:05,292
PEOPLE?

29
00:01:05,293 --> 00:01:07,461
THE WHOLE POINT OF I.C.E. IS TO

30
00:01:07,462 --> 00:01:09,563
PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FROM

31
00:01:09,564 --> 00:01:12,232
ILLEGALS WHO WOULD DO US HARM

32
00:01:12,233 --> 00:01:13,433
PHYSICALLY AND FINANCIALLY.

33
00:01:13,434 --> 00:01:14,868
LISTEN TO THIS ONE.

34
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:17,537
>> I.C.E. ISN'T DOING WAY IT'S

35
00:01:17,538 --> 00:01:18,739
CREATED TO DO.

36
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,508
IT'S BEING USED AS HIS OWN

37
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:33,186
DOING WHAT IT WAS CREATED TO DO?

38
00:01:33,187 --> 00:01:34,955
I.C.E. IS DOING EXACTLY WHAT IT

39
00:01:43,464 --> 00:01:44,164
POLICE FORCE?

40
00:01:44,165 --> 00:01:46,466
AND YOU THINK I.C.E. IS MAKING

41
00:01:46,467 --> 00:01:47,768
US LESS SAFE?

42
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:52,406
I HAVE GOT TWO WORD FOR YOU.

43
00:01:55,977 --> 00:01:58,745
FOR ALL YOU GENIUSES OUT THERE.

44
00:01:58,746 --> 00:02:00,847
I.C.E. DOES NOT SEPARATE PARENTS

45
00:02:00,848 --> 00:02:02,883
AND CHILDREN AT THE BORDER.

46
00:02:02,884 --> 00:02:03,884
BORDER PATROL DOES THAT.

47
00:02:14,395 --> 00:02:16,730
NARCOTICS AND 90% OF THE HEROIN.

48
00:02:16,731 --> 00:02:19,166
PRAY TELL, WHO DEPORTS THE

49
00:02:23,471 --> 00:02:27,140
SHOULD WE JUST LET BY GONES BE

50
00:02:33,581 --> 00:02:36,616
AND GIVE HIS HIS FOOD STAMPS AND

51
00:02:36,617 --> 00:02:38,151
CALL IT A DAY?

52
00:02:38,152 --> 00:02:40,821
YOU DON'T WANT THEM DEPORTED.

53
00:02:40,822 --> 00:02:42,122
NEIGHBOR THEY SHOULD COME LIVE

54
00:02:42,123 --> 00:02:43,890
WITH YOU.

55
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:45,258
KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND WHO HAS

56
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:47,561
AMBITIONS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT

57
00:02:47,562 --> 00:02:49,529
IN 2020 SAYS --

58
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,265
>> WE SHOULD PROTECT FAMILIES

59
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,837
TODAY.

60
00:02:56,838 --> 00:02:58,705
WE SHOULD GET RID OF IT, START

61
00:02:58,706 --> 00:03:01,341
OVER AND REIMAGINE IT WITH

62
00:03:01,342 --> 00:03:03,910
SOMETHING THAT WORKS.

63
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:05,345
JUDGE JEANINE: WHENEVER A

64
00:03:05,346 --> 00:03:06,780
DEMOCRAT DOESN'T WANT TO FOLLOW

65
00:03:06,781 --> 00:03:11,885
THE LAW, THEY SAY IT'S BROKEN.

66
00:03:11,886 --> 00:03:14,321
I SAY THE TAX SYSTEM IS BROKEN

67
00:03:14,322 --> 00:03:16,756
AND WE DON'T HAVE TO PAY OUR

68
00:03:16,757 --> 00:03:19,493
TAXES AND WE CAN SUCK ANOTHER

69
00:03:19,494 --> 00:03:20,160
COUNTRY DRY.

70
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:22,796
THAT WAY NONE OF US HAVE TO PAY

71
00:03:22,797 --> 00:03:23,763
TAXES.

72
00:03:23,764 --> 00:03:28,568
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT THE

73
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:33,273
IMMIGRATION LAWS EVEN FORCED.

74
00:03:33,274 --> 00:03:36,576
THE MORE WHO COME IN, THE MORE

75
00:03:36,577 --> 00:03:44,651
TAXES WE PAY FOR EDUCATION, AND

76
00:03:44,652 --> 00:03:46,419
SOCIAL SERVICES.

77
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,321
NONE OF THIS IS FAIR TO THOSE

78
00:03:48,322 --> 00:03:49,890
IMMIGRANTS WHO PLAYED BY THE

79
00:03:49,891 --> 00:03:50,323
RULES.

80
00:03:50,324 --> 00:03:52,692
THE NARRATIVE OF TODAY'S PROTEST

81
00:03:52,693 --> 00:03:53,560
IS BACKWARDS.

82
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:56,863
THOSE MARCHING OBJECT TO ADULTS

83
00:03:56,864 --> 00:03:58,165
WHO CROSS THE BORDER BEING

84
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:01,501
SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILDREN.

85
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:04,337
IT HAPPENED EVEN BEFORE TRUMP

86
00:04:04,338 --> 00:04:05,772
WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT.

87
00:04:05,773 --> 00:04:10,544
NO ONE CARED OR PROTESTED.

88
00:04:10,545 --> 00:04:12,546
TRUMP ENDED THE FAMILY

89
00:04:12,547 --> 00:04:13,547
SEPARATION, YET THEY STILL

90
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:18,652
THE OVERARCHING MESSAGE IS

91
00:04:18,653 --> 00:04:20,120
ILLEGALS, PEOPLE WHO DO NOT

92
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,756
RESPECT OUR LAWS ARE ENTITLED TO

93
00:04:22,757 --> 00:04:24,324
EVERYTHING WE AMERICANS ARE.

94
00:04:28,296 --> 00:04:31,264
WEALTH, OUR CAPITALISTIC SUCCESS

95
00:04:31,265 --> 00:04:33,333
AND WAY OF LIFE WITH THEM.

96
00:04:33,334 --> 00:04:35,669
THIS, MY FRIENDS, IS SOCIALISM.

97
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:39,306
LIKE THE WOMEN'S MARCH, THESE

98
00:04:39,307 --> 00:04:41,174
ANTI-TRUMP PROTESTERS ARE

99
00:04:41,175 --> 00:04:42,175
EXTREMELY WELL ORGANIZED.

100
00:04:42,176 --> 00:04:44,477
THEY ARE MORE THAN POLITICAL.

101
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:45,812
THEY ARE IDEOLOGICAL.

102
00:04:45,813 --> 00:04:48,148
WE ARE WITNESSING THE EVOLUTION

103
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:52,852
OF A SOCIALIST COUP.

104
00:04:52,853 --> 00:04:55,789
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE WHAT I AM

105
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,757
SAYING LISTEN TO IT FROM THEIR

106
00:04:57,758 --> 00:05:06,733
OWN MOUTHS.

107
00:05:18,179 --> 00:05:19,579
28-YEAR-OLD CONGRESSIONAL

108
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,851
CANDIDATE WHO TOOK DOWN A

109
00:05:24,852 --> 00:05:27,487
LONG-TERM CONGRESSMAN.

110
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,892
FOR WORKING HARD, SHE WON THE

111
00:05:32,893 --> 00:05:35,295
ASSISTANCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC

112
00:05:35,296 --> 00:05:36,963
SOCIALISTS OF AMERICA.

113
00:05:36,964 --> 00:05:39,899
A LITTLE KNOWN SOCIALIST FROM

114
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,867
VERMONT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE

115
00:05:40,868 --> 00:05:45,839
CANDIDATE IN 2016 BUT FOR THE

116
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,341
CORRUPTION OF THE DEMOCRATIC

117
00:05:48,342 --> 00:05:49,909
NATIONAL COMMITTEE.

118
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,811
SOCIALISTS ARE BEGINNING TO WIN

119
00:05:51,812 --> 00:05:53,546
ELECTIONS AT THE STATE AND

120
00:05:53,547 --> 00:05:56,750
NATIONAL LEVEL, DEFEATING EVEN

121
00:05:56,751 --> 00:05:57,951
LONG-TERM INCUMBENTS.

122
00:05:57,952 --> 00:06:01,521
EXPECT MORE HARD LEFT CANDIDATES

123
00:06:01,522 --> 00:06:03,757
TO RUN.

124
00:06:03,758 --> 00:06:07,294
EVEN OBAMA'S "LIFE OF JULIA"

125
00:06:07,295 --> 00:06:10,897
SUGGESTS AN ANTI-CAPITALIST

126
00:06:10,898 --> 00:06:11,264
FRAMEWORK.

127
00:06:11,265 --> 00:06:16,603
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO NEED

128
00:06:16,604 --> 00:06:17,737
REMINDING, SOCIAL I. DOESN'T

129
00:06:17,738 --> 00:06:18,505
WORK.

130
00:06:18,506 --> 00:06:20,473
ACCORDING TO THE "WALL STREET

131
00:06:20,474 --> 00:06:23,810
JOURNAL," PEOPLE GO THROUGH

132
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:25,612
GARBAGE BAGS TO TAKE WHATEVER

133
00:06:25,613 --> 00:06:28,715
THEY CAN THEN TRY TO SELL THE

134
00:06:28,716 --> 00:06:32,519
EMPTY BAGS IN VENEZUELA.

135
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,620
INCOME IS SUBJECT TO STATE

136
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:35,822
CONTROL AND IT HASN'T WORKED OUT

137
00:06:35,823 --> 00:06:38,825
WELL IN SWEDEN EITHER.

138
00:06:38,826 --> 00:06:40,994
PREGNANT MOTHERS ARE TURNED AWAY

139
00:06:40,995 --> 00:06:45,332
FROM MA TURNITY WARDS BECAUSE OF

140
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:48,301
OVER -- MATERNITY WARDS, CAUSING

141
00:06:48,302 --> 00:06:49,969
PREGNANT WOMEN TO GIVE BIRTH ON

142
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,738
THE STREETS.

143
00:06:55,142 --> 00:06:58,244
PAY PAY TAXES, BELIEVE IN

144
00:06:58,245 --> 00:00:00,000
CAPITALISM AND HAVE NO PLANS TO
