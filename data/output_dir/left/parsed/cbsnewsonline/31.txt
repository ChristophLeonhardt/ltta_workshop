>>> WE HAVE REPUBLICAN SENATORS 
ON THE FBI INVESTIGATION 
LOOKING INTO THE SUPREME COURT 
NOMINEE, BRETT KAVANAUGH AND 
HIS RECORD. 
LET'S LISTEN IN.  
>>  THE SECOND THING WE KNOW 
FOR SURE IS THAT THERE IS NO 
WAY THAT ANYTHING WE DID WOULD 
SATISFY THE DEMOCRATS. 
THEY ALWAYS HAVE A REASON WHY 
THE GOALPOST NEEDS TO BE MOVED 
FURTHER DOWN THE FIELD. NOTHING 
WE COULD DO WOULD SATISFY THEM. 
YOU HAVE SEEN IT FROM THE 
BEGINNING AND WITH THAT, I WANT 
TO TURN IT OVER TO MEMBERS OF 
THE COMMITTEE WHO I THINK HAVE 
DONE AN OUTSTANDING JOB. 
>>  BEFORE I SAY A FEW WORDS, 
SO THAT I WILL HAVE TO DOES NOT 
ANNOUNCE EACH PERSON, PLEASE 
JUST COME -- JUST SO THAT I DO 
NOT ANNOUNCE EACH PERSON, JUST 
COME TO THE PODIUM AND WE WILL 
TAKE QUESTIONS. 
THIS IS THE 87 DAY. THAT IS 
THREE WEEKS LONGER THAN THE 
AVERAGE OF THE LAST THREE OR 
FOUR NOMINEES TO THE SUPREME 
COURT. 
DO NOT TELL ME THAT WE HAVE NOT 
SPENT ENOUGH TIME. 
ALSO, I FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT 
WHERE THIS NOMINATION IS RIGHT 
NOW. 
I DO NOT SAY THAT FROM THE 
STANDPOINT OF COUNTING VOTES. 
I SAY THAT FROM THE STANDPOINT 
OF THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THIS 
CANDIDATE AND THE FACT THAT 
THOSE QUALIFICATIONS TO BE A 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE BASED 
UPON HIS 12 YEARS ON THE D.C. 
CIRCUIT WITHOUT ANYBODY FINDING 
ANY FAULT WITH HIS 
QUALIFICATIONS TO SERVE BUT 
THAT HAS NOT BEEN TALKED ABOUT 
MUCH. 
EVERYTHING ELSE. 
THIS PERSON IS VERY WELL-
QUALIFIED. A PERSON THAT 
BELIEVES IN THE VEGETABLES OF 
DUE PROCESS AND THE PRESUMPTION 
OF INNOCENCE AND READINESS TO 
SERVE. SO, JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
SHOULD BE CONFIRMED ON SATURDAY 
. NOW, THIS STARTED DOWNHILL 
VERY QUICKLY ON JULY 10 WHEN 
CHUCK SCHUMER SAID THAT WE WILL 
DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO STOP 
THIS NOMINATION. 
YOU CAN LOOK BACK 87 DAYS AND 
YOU CAN SEE THAT EVERYTHING BUT 
WHETHER HE IS QUALIFIED TO 
SERVE HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP. 
I HAVE TRIED TO COMMIT AND I 
THINK I HAVE CARRIED OUT WHAT I 
PROMISED IMMEDIATELY. 
THAT WE WILL HAVE A FAIR AND 
THOROUGH PROCESS. 
WE HAVE HAD A FAIR AND THOROUGH 
PROCESS AND I THINK THAT IS 
BEST DEMONSTRATED BY THE FACT 
THAT THE MINUTE I READ ABOUT 
WHO THE PERSON WAS IN THE 
FEINSTEIN LETTER WITH DOCTOR 
FORD. 
I READ ABOUT HER NAME IN THE 
PAPER AND WE GOT ON IT RIGHT 
AWAY TO PROVIDE WHAT SHE WANTED 
AND IN TURN, WE PROVIDED THE 
SAME FOR HIM FOR KAVANAUGH  -- 
FORUM FOR KAVANAUGH . WHAT I 
HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH IS THE 
DOWNHILL SLOPE THAT CHUCK 
SCHUMER HAS PUT US ON AND IT'S 
REALLY DEALING WITH THE 
DEMOLITION DERBY. 
THEY JUST ABOUT DESTROYED A 
GOOD PERSON TO BE ON THE 
SUPREME COURT. HOPEFULLY, WE 
ARE 48 HOURS AWAY FROM HAVING A 
NEW PERSON ON THE SUPREME COURT.
>> I CERTAINLY ENDORSE 
EVERYTHING THAT THE CHAIRMAN OF 
THE COMMITTEE HAS SAID.  
I AM DISAPPOINTED IN MY 
DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES FOR WHAT 
THEY ARE DOING. 
THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR IT BUT 
THEY ARE DOING IT. 
I AM GRATEFUL TO THE FBI FOR 
THEIR EFFORT IN DOING A THOROUGH
AND IMPORTANT INVESTIGATION. 
MANY OF US HAVE SAID THAT IF 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH DID WHAT HE WAS 
ACCUSED OF DOING  BY SOME OF 
THE DEMOCRATS AND OUTSIDE PEOPLE
, HE SHOULD BE DISQUALIFIED. 
AFTER INVESTIGATIONS FROM BOTH 
OF THE COMMITTEE AND THE FBI, 
WE HAVE FOUND ABSOLUTELY 
NOTHING TO CORROBORATE  
ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HIM. 
WE NEED TO CONFIRM HIM RIGHT 
AWAY. 
THIS CONFIRMATION WILL BE A 
VICTORY FOR THE SENATE AS AN 
INSTITUTION AND A REMINDER THAT 
THE POLITICS ARE BASELESS AND 
PERSONAL DESTRUCTION HAS NO 
PLACE HERE. 
I THINK HE IS ONE OF THE BEST 
NOMINEES THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN 
IN MY 42 YEARS IN THE U. S. 
SENATE. I APOLOGIZE TO HIM FOR 
THE WAY HE HAS BEEN TREATED. 
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POSITION 
AND DEMOCRATS DO HAVE A RIGHT 
TO FEEL WORRIED AND UPSET ABOUT 
A REPUBLICAN GETTING THE SEAT 
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD 
WON THE ELECTION BUT THAT IS 
NOT THE CASE AND OUR SIDE HAS 
HANDLED THIS WITH DISCRETION, 
HANDLING EVERY PROBLEM THAT HAS 
COME UP AND FRANKLY, I HOPE WE 
CAN MOVE FORWARD AND GET THIS 
DONE. 
IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS A GREAT 
JUDGE  AND HE WILL MAKE A GREAT 
JUSTICE ON THE SUPREME COURT 
AND I INTEND TO DO EVERYTHING I 
CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT HE GETS 
THERE AS QUICKLY AS HE CAN. 
>> OUR FRIEND , THE SENIOR 
SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA SAID 
ABOUT THIS CONFIRMATION PROCESS 
-- SHE SAID THIS IS NOT NORMAL 
AND I AGREE WITH HER. 
IF THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL, 
WHILE TO THE SENATE AND ANY 
NOMINEE THAT WOULD BE SUBJECTED 
TO THE UNACCEPTABLE CHARACTER 
ASSASSINATION THAT WE HAVE SEEN 
DIRECTED AT THIS NOMINEE WITH 
THIS CASE. 
IF THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL, I DO 
NOT KNOW WHO WOULD WANT TO 
SERVE AND I THINK PEOPLE WOULD 
BE JUSTIFIED IN LIVING ANY 
RESPECT FOR THE SENATE AND THE 
WAY IT CONDUCTS ITS SELF IN THE 
CONFIRMATION PROCESS. 
MORE IS AT STAKE THAN JUST THIS 
NOMINATION. 
THE SENATE ITSELF IS ON TRIAL 
HERE. 
A VOTE AGAINST JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
TOMORROW WOULD BE AN 
ENDORSEMENT  WITH THE 
MISHANDLING OF THIS 
CONFIRMATION PROCESS BECAUSE OF 
HIDING RELEVANT INFORMATION 
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN EXAMINED 
ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS IN A WAY 
THAT RESPECTED DOCTOR FORD TO 
REQUEST FOR PRIVACY -- DOCTOR 
FORD'S REQUEST FOR PRIVACY. 
A VOTE AGAINST JUDGE KAVANAUGH  
WOULD BE A VOTE FOR ABUSING THE 
CONFIRMATION PROCESS AND A GOOD 
PERSON AND IT WILL BE A VOTE 
FOR THE SHAMEFUL INTIMIDATION 
TACTICS THAT HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED 
AS PART OF AN ORCHESTRATED 
SMEAR CAMPAIGN. 
I AGREE THAT THE FBI 
INVESTIGATION, THEY HAVE TALKED 
TO 150 DIFFERENT PEOPLE THROUGH 
THE SEVEN BACKGROUND 
INVESTIGATIONS THAT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN THROUGH 
SINCE 1993 . NO COOPERATION -- 
CORROBORATION. 
UNFORTUNATELY, THIS COULD HAVE 
BEEN AVOIDED WITH MOST OF THE 
EMBARRASSMENT TO DOCTOR FORD 
AND THE PUBLIC CIRCUS -LIKE 
ATMOSPHERE IS THE RANKING 
NUMBER HAD JUST MADE THE 
ALLEGATIONS KNOWN IN THE 
REGULAR PROCESS IN A WAY THAT 
WOULD HAVE PROTECTED HER AND 
HER CONFIDENTIALITY. 
I HAVE SAID BEFORE AND I WILL 
SAY AGAIN THAT I BELIEVE THAT 
WE SHOULD AND WE DID TREAT 
DOCTOR FORD IN THE SAME MANNER 
THAT I WOULD WANT MY DAUGHTERS 
TREATED OR MY WIFE BUT WE HAVE 
TO REMEMBER THAT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH  IS ENTITLED TO A 
FAIR PROCESS AS WELL AND HE HAS 
NOT BEEN SUBJECTED TO A FAIR 
PROCESS. 
ANYTHING BUT. 
NOW IS THE TIME TO QUIT ALL OF 
THE ANTICS AND HIJINKS AND THE 
SURFACE -- THE CIRCUS LIKE 
ATMOSPHERE. 
WE WILL DO THAT TOMORROW AND 
SATURDAY WHEN WE FINALLY VOTE 
TO CONFIRM THIS FINE MAN IN 
THIS IMPORTANT POSITION. 
>> THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THE 
FBI REPORTS  THAT WE HAVE 
RECEIVED THIS MORNING HAS BEEN 
EXHAUSTIVE. IT HAS BEEN A 
COLLABORATIVE PROCESS WITH MY 
COLLEAGUES AND IT OCCURRED IN A 
CLASSIFIED ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE 
THESE WERE DOCUMENTS THAT WERE 
NOT ALLOWED TO BE DISCLOSED TO 
THE PUBLIC. 
BECAUSE WE CAN REVIEW THEM IN 
ONLY ONE PLACE, WE REVIEWED 
THEM TOGETHER AND WE STOPPED 
AND TALKED ABOUT EACH POINT 
MADE TO MADE SURE -- TO MAKE 
SURE THAT WE UNDERSTOOD EACH 
INTERVIEW AND EACH REPORT. 
ALTHOUGH THAT PART OF IT BY 
OPERATION OF LAW IS NOT ALLOWED 
TO BE PUBLIC, I WANT TO GIVE 
YOU THE ASSURANCE THAT WE 
TREATED THESE DOCUMENTS JUST AS 
WE HAVE TREATED EACH AND EVERY 
ALLEGATION WITH UTMOST 
SERIOUSNESS AND A DESIRE TO DO 
NOTHING MORE THAN SEARCH FOR 
THE TRUTH. 
AS WE HAVE SPENT HOURS UPON 
HOURS WITH HEARING TESTIMONY IN 
THE OPEN HEARINGS BEFORE THE 
PUBLIC, WE HAVE ALSO HAD HOURS 
UPON HOURS REVIEWING THE 
DOCUMENTS IN A CLASSIFIED 
ENVIRONMENT. 
ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT
ARE SERIOUS AND SEXUAL ASSAULT, 
THEY ARE OF THE MOST SERIOUS 
NATURE AND HAVE TO BE TREATED 
WITH UTMOST SERIOUSNESS. 
THEY HAVE BEEN IN THIS CASE. 
AGAIN, THIS IS SOMEONE WHO HAS 
BEEN THROUGH SEVEN BACKGROUND 
INVESTIGATIONS IN THE COURSE OF 
THE LAST THREE DECADES. 
WITH OVER 150 PEOPLE 
INTERVIEWED WITH REGARD TO HIM. 
THIS IS A MAN OF OUTSTANDING 
CHARACTER WHO HAS LIVED AN 
EXEMPLARY LIFE. 
HE HAD HIS FAMILY -- HE AND HIS 
FAMILY HAVEN'T OBJECTED TO A 
LOT OF HUMILIATION AND 
QUESTIONING IN THE RECENT WEEKS.
THAT HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT PART 
OF THIS PROCESS FOR HIM BUT IN 
THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT, HE 
HAS PROVEN HIS CHARACTER AND 
WILLINGNESS TO BE CANDID WITH 
THE PUBLIC AND EVEN SHARING 
FACTS THAT ARE AT TIMES 
UNCOMFORTABLE. 
I AM CONVINCED OF THIS MAN'S 
CHARACTER AND HISTORY SLOWNESS 
AND QUALIFICATIONS TO SERVE ON 
THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED 
STATES AND I WHOLEHEARTEDLY 
SUPPORT HIS CONFIRMATION AND 
LOOK FORWARD TO VOTING FOR HIM 
IN THE COMING HOURS. 
>> I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING MY 
COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID . I ALSO 
WANT TO SAY THAT DOCTOR FORD, I 
FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT SHE DID 
EXPERIENCE A TRAUMATIC EVENT IN 
HER LIFE BUT I ALSO BELIEVE 
THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT 
WE HAVE SEEN TO THE FBI 
BACKGROUND CHECKS AND THE TIME 
THAT WE HAVE SPENT IN THE 
HEARING TO SUBSTANTIATE THAT 
THESE CLAIMS ARE PROPERLY 
ALLEGED AND DIRECTED TOWARDS 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.  
THOUSANDS OF PAGES IN THAT 
BRIEFING ROOM, CENTERED ONLY 
AND I WERE IN THAT ROOM FOR AN 
HOUR AND AT THE DESK IS ALSO 
SOME 1500 PAGES THAT DOCUMENT 
THE FBI INVESTIGATIONS AND 
ANOTHER OF THOSE WAS THERE ANY 
REFERENCE -- KEEP IN MIND THIS 
GOES BACK 23 TO 24 YEARS. 
THIS WOULD ONLY BE SIX OR SEVEN 
YEARS AFTER HE WAS OUT OF 
COLLEGE AND CERTAINLY IF IT WAS 
RECENT MEMORY, YOU WOULD SEE 
SOME SUGGESTION BUT THERE WAS 
NONE. 
THE LAST THING I WILL LEAVE YOU 
WITH IS THAT IT APPEARS THAT 
SINCE MY COLLEAGUES ARE NOT 
ABLE TO SUBSTANTIATE THE 
ALLEGATIONS BUT THEY HAVE MOVED 
TO THIS NARRATIVE OF THE WAY 
THAT HE BEHAVED IN THE HEARING 
LAST WEEK AND IT WAS SOMEHOW 
PUT INTO QUESTION HIS JUDICIAL 
TEMPERAMENT. IN THE 31 HOURS 
THAT HE WAS BEFORE THE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, I SAW 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
HE WAS ACTUALLY PATIENT  WITH 
UNFAIR QUESTIONS AND BEING CUT 
OFF BUT HE MAINTAINED HIS POISE 
THROUGHOUT THE 32 HOURS WITH 
VERY FEW BREAKS. 
LAST WEEK, I SAW BRETT 
KAVANAUGH. 
I WAS NOT JUDGING HIM AS A 
JUDGE  BUT A HUMAN BEING HE WAS 
HAVING HIS LIFE DESTROYED 
BEFORE HIS VERY EYES AND HAVING 
HIS DAUGHTER HEARTBROKEN AND 
HIS WIFE ISSUED DEATH THREATS. 
IF ANYONE IN THIS ROOM HAD GONE 
TO THE SAME EXPERIENCE, YOU 
WOULD HAVE THE SAME EMOTIONS 
AND DID THE COURSE OF THAT 
TESTIMONY, I THINK HE STILL 
COMPOSED HIMSELF AND DID A GOOD 
JOB IN ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS 
AND DEFENDING HIS GOOD NAME. 
>> WE ARE READY FOR QUESTIONS . 
>>  CAN YOU TELL US HOW YOU 
CAME UP WITH THE LIST OF WHO 
SHOULD BE INTERVIEWED BY THE 
FBI? 
>>  I THINK I WILL LET YOU DO 
THAT BECAUSE YOU ARE AT THE 
SAME MEETING I WAS AT. 
>> WE DID NOT COME UP WITH A 
LIST  OF THE PEOPLE THAT THE 
FBI SHOULD INTERVIEW. 
THE FBI WAS JUST TO CONDUCT AN 
INVESTIGATION INTO ANY AND ALL 
CREDIBLE AND CURRENT 
ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL 
MISCONDUCT BY DOES KAVANAUGH  
AND THE FBI MADE THAT DECISION 
AS TO WHO TO INTERVIEW. 
>>   
>>  THEY DID AND I THINK I 
ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION. 
I REQUEST WAS TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE AND THEN THEY MADE THE 
REQUEST OF THE FBI TO CONDUCT 
AN INVESTIGATION WITH CURRENT 
AND CREDIBLE ACCUSATIONS OF 
SEXUAL WAS CONDUCT. 
THEY DID THAT. 
>> JUST TO BE CLEAR, WE DID NOT 
GIVE THEM A LIST OF PEOPLE  
WILL AND ONLY THE PEOPLE THAT 
THEY CAN SPEAK WITH. 
WE HAVE THEM GO BACK TO THOSE 
THAT ISSUED STATEMENTS AND PART 
OF THE PROTOCOL IS IF THERE'S 
ANYONE ELSE TO SPEAK TO. 
THEY IDENTIFIED OTHERS THAT PUT 
FORWARD STATEMENTS BEFORE AND 
WE SAW THAT IN THE RECORD THIS 
MORNING. 
>>   
POTENTIALLY PEOPLE THAT 
COOPERATE -- CORROBORATE THIS  
AND TO TELL THE WHITE HOUSE TO 
DO THIS FBI INVESTIGATION. 
>> THE FBI HAS  GOTTEN ALL OF 
THE PERSON THEY NEED IN ORDER 
TO INTERVIEW WHOEVER THEY THINK 
IS NECESSARY. 
THERE HAS BEEN NO ONE TO 
CORROBORATE'S ALLEGATIONS BY 
DOCTOR FORD OR MISS RAMIREZ AND 
THIS HAS BEEN REPORTED BACK TO 
US. 
THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THIS IS 
THE WAY. 
THIS WAS NOT A SEARCH FOR THE 
TRUTH. 
IT BECAME CLEAR EARLY ON WHEN 
THIS WAS HIDDEN FROM THE 
COMMITTEE AND HANDLED IN SUCH 
THIS WAY AGAINST HER WISHES, 
THIS IS A SEARCH AND DESTROY 
MISSION. 
NOT SEARCH FOR THE TRUTH. 
WE HAVE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN 
TO TREAT BOTH JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
AND DOCTOR FORD  FAIRLY AND TO 
TREAT ALL ALLEGATIONS MADE 
SERIOUSLY AND IT HAS BEEN 
STUDIED BY THE FBI AS WELL IS 
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE STAFF 
AND THERE IS NOT REALLY 
ANYTHING ELSE. 
>>  THE PRESIDENT SAID THERE 
SHOULD NOT EVEN BE A LITTLE 
DOUBT. 
ACCUSERS ARE SUGGESTING THAT 
THEY COULD QUADRATE THEIR 
STORIES -- CORROBORATE THEIR 
STORIES.  
>>  OF PEOPLE HAVE TESTIFY 
CONTRARY TO IT THAT MISS RAMIREZ
AND DOCTOR FORD HAVE ALLEGED. 
THE WITNESSES THEY HAVE 
IDENTIFIED THING THEY WERE 
PRESENT AT THE EVENT HAVE ALL 
REFUTED THEIR ALLEGATIONS SO I 
THINKTHAT OUGHT TO SETTLE IT. 
>> ONE THING THAT WAS 
NOTICEABLE  WAS THAT IT WAS NOT 
CLEAR IF THE COMMITTEE WOULD GO 
TO COUNSEL BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS,
REGARDING THE ALLEGATIONS, 
WHILE THE NEED TAKE ANYTHING 
BACK TO THE ATTORNEYS FOR 
DOCTOR CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD. 
OR WILL YOU REFER THEM TO THE 
AVA? 
>> RIGHT NOW I DO NOT KNOW WHEN 
I DO NOT KNOW IF THERE IS ANY 
REASON TO.  
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO -- THIS 
IS ALMOST ROCK-BOTTOM SO I 
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE FUTURE 
OF MENDING THINGS SO THAT WE 
CAN DO THINGS IN A COLLEGIAL 
WAY THAT THE SENDER OUGHT TO DO 
AND PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES 
TO THE SUPREME COURT NOMINATION.
YOU FOLKS CAN HAVE SOMETHING TO 
DO WITH THIS. 
I WOULD NEVER USE THE WORD FAKE 
NEWS BECAUSE I CONSIDER YOU 
FOLKS POLICEMAN FOR OUR 
DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT 
BUT SOME OF YOU DO HAVE BIAS. 
I HAVE HAD DEMONSTRATORS IN MY 
OFFICE FOR TWO WEEKS BOTH FOR 
KAVANAUGH AND AGAINST KAVANAUGH 
. ONE TIME, THE PEOPLE THAT 
WERE FOR KAVANAUGH  WANTED TO 
BE INTERVIEWED AND THEY SAID WE 
ARE ONLY INTERESTED IN 
INTERVIEWING PEOPLE AGAINST 
KAVANAUGH.  
THAT IS A BIAS. 
>>  THE LEGAL TEAM SENT A 
LETTER AND THEY ARE 
CHARACTERIZING THIS VISITATION 
--  
>> LET THE FBI DO WHAT THEY 
HAVE BEEN HIRED TO DO AND KEY 
POLITICAL INTERFERENCE OUT OF 
IT.  
MY MAKING A CALL TO THE FBI 
THAT YOU OUGHT TO DO SOMETHING, 
I MAY KNOW CALL TO THE FBI 
SINCE THIS WHOLE PROCESS 
STARTED A WEEK AGO AND I AM NOT 
GOING TO. 
I NEVER HAD ANY CONVERSATION 
WITH ANYONE IN THE WHITE HOUSE 
BECAUSE I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN 
THE F VI. 
THEY GO WHERE THE FACTS LEAD. 
>> I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT 
TO CONSIDER THE SOURCE . THIS 
IS A LEGAL TEAM EMILY FORMALLY 
COMMUNICATED ON MORE THAN ONE 
OCCASION THAT WE WOULD COME TO 
CALIFORNIA AND HAVE AN 
INTERVIEW ON HER TERMS. DOCTOR 
FORD WAS NOT AWARE OF THAT AND 
IT MAKES ME WONDER OF THE 
COMPETENCE OF THE FOLKS THAT 
ARE ADVISING HER. 
>> EITHER  THE COMPETENCY OR 
POLITICAL BIAS THAT THEY HAVE. 
>>   
>>  NONE OF THIS HAS THAT 
PERSPECTIVE YET BUT I HOPE WHAT 
HISTORY DOCUMENTS IS WHAT I 
SAID EARLIER. 
ONCE WE LEARNED OF HER IDENTITY 
AND ONCE HER NAME WAS LEE, 
CONTRARY TO HER WISHES AND 
CONSENT TO THE PUBLIC, SHE WAS 
FORCED TO TELL HER STORY NOT IN 
A SAFE SETTING BUT IN A CIRCUS 
LIKE ATMOSPHERE. I HOPE WE DID 
THE BEST THAT WE COULD IN THOSE 
AWFUL SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT 
HE -- TO TREAT HER WITH RESPECT 
AND DIGNITY BUT THAT DOES NOT 
MEAN THAT WE FORGET OUR BASIC 
CONCEPT OF FAIR PLAY WITH DUE 
PROCESS. 
THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TRIED TO 
INTERVIEW EVERY WITNESS THAT 
HAS ANY ALLEGED KNOWLEDGE OF 
THE FACTS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN 
THE PROCESS AND WHAT WE KNOW 
NOW IS THERE IS NO 
CORROBORATION, EVEN WITH THE 
PEOPLE THAT SHE HAS IDENTIFIED 
AS BEING AT THE SCENE. 
I THINK WE HAVE DONE THE BEST 
ESPECIALLY WITH THE MISHANDLING 
WITH THE RANKING NUMBER ON THIS 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO TREAT 
EVERYONE FAIRLY. 
IT'S TIME NOW TO VOTE AND THAT 
IS WHAT WE WILL DO STARTING 
TOMORROW MORNING. 
>> I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING  
BEFORE YOU ASK YOUR QUESTION. 
AS SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY TRIED 
CASES IN THE FEDERAL COURT 
SYSTEM AND IN FRONT OF TWO OF 
THE MOST NOTORIOUS JUDGES FOR 
OUR COUNTRY, I WANT YOU TO KNOW 
THAT I TAKE THIS STUFF VERY 
SERIOUSLY. I DO NOT KNOW THAT I 
HAVE EVER SEEN ANYBODY THAT 
WOULD EXCEED JUDGE KAVANAUGH  
AS A JUDGE IN THE FEDERAL COURT 
SYSTEM. 
I PERSONALLY RESENT WHAT HAS 
BEEN HEAPED UPON HIM. 
IT'S NOT RIGHT OR FAIR AND IT 
SENDS A MESSAGE TO EVERYBODY. 
THIS IS JUST WRONG. 
UNFORTUNATELY, THERE ARE SOME 
PEOPLE WHO DO NOT CARE AND THEY 
KNOW THAT THESE JUDGES ON THE 
SUPREME COURT WILL HANDLE 
DIFFICULT ISSUES AND I AM SURE 
THAT WHEN THE JUDGES THERE ON 
THE SUPREME COURT, HE WILL 
DECIDE ISSUES THAT WILL 
TERRIBLY DISAPPOINT REPUBLICANS 
AND MAYBE TERRIBLY DISAPPOINT 
DEMOCRATS FROM TIME TO TIME BUT 
I KNOW ONE THING, HE IS HONEST 
AND HE WILL DECIDE BASED -- 
DECIDE CASES BASED UPON THE LAW 
AND HE WILL DO A GOOD JOB IN 
DOING IT. 
THAT IS THE REASON WHY WE FELT 
SO DEEPLY ABOUT THIS. 
FRANKLY, I RESENT THIS BUSINESS 
OF TAKING ON ANYBODY IN THE 
REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
FOR A FEDERAL JUDGESHIP. IT'S 
REALLY IRRITATING AND THESE 
PEOPLE HAVE SPENT A LIFETIME 
GETTING AV RATINGS, THE HIGHEST 
RATING YOU CAN GET FROM THE 
SERVICE OF ATTORNEYS IN THIS 
COUNTRY. 
I HAVE THE HIGHEST RATING YOU 
CAN POSSIBLY HAVE SO I KNOW 
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. 
HERE IN UTAH AND BACK IN 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
THESE ARE IMPORTANT THINGS TO 
ME. 
WHEN I GOT UP TO PRACTICE LAW 
IN UTAH, I WAS TOLD THAT 
JUDGE'S WINTER WAS WHEN YOU HAD 
TO WATCH BUT I GOT ALONG WITH 
HIM. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT 
POSITION IN THIS MAN IS 
QUALIFIED AND TO PUT HIM THROUGH
THIS TYPE OF A MESS JUST BECAUSE
THEY ARE UNHAPPY THAT DONALD 
TRUMP HAD THE RIGHT TO APPOINT 
HIM IS JUST PLAIN WRONG. 
I HAVE TO SAY THAT I AM PROUD 
OF MY COLLEAGUES FOR STANDING 
UP ON THIS ISSUE AND WE ALL 
OUGHT TO BE STANDING UP ON 
THESE ISSUES. 
WE WANT COMPETENT FEDERAL JUDGES
WHO WERE NOT BIAS AND WILL 
ABIDE BY THE LAWS THEMSELVES. 
THIS MAN IS ONE OF THOSE. 
>> LAST QUESTION.  
>>  WILL THE PUBLIC EVER GET 
ANY SORT OF A SUMMARY OF THIS? 
>> TELL HER ABOUT THE RULE.  
>> IT WAS VERY CLEAR TO US  IN 
THE MEMORANDUM OF 2009 BETWEEN 
OBAMA AND THE CHAIRMAN THAT 
THERE IS ONE DOCUMENT AND NO 
COPIES MADE AND NOT RELEASED TO 
THE PUBLIC. 
SO, WE CANNOT DO THAT. 
THERE ARE SOME SUGGESTIONS THAT 
THE WHITE HOUSE CAN DO IT BUT 
YOU WILL HAVE TO GO TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE TO GET THAT ANSWER 
TO YOUR QUESTION. 
>> SENATE REPUBLICANS ARE NOT 
HOLDING BACK SAYING THE PROCESS 
IS FAIR  AND THOROUGH WHEN 
INVESTIGATING NEW CLAIMS 
AGAINST THE SUPREME COURT 
NOMINEE. 
I WANT TO BRING IN THE 
POLITICAL REPORTER WHO JOINS ME 
NOW. THE BIG DEVELOPMENT THIS 
AFTERNOON HAS BEEN AT THE 
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLICAN HAS SAID 
SHE WILL VOTE NO. 
SHE IS A RED STATE AND SHE HAS 
DOUBLE DIGITS. 
WHAT YOU MAKE OF THAT? 
>>  SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST 
DEMOCRATS EFFORT RELAXING. 
SHE IS UNDERWATER BY THE DOUBLE 
DIGITS AND THERE ARE A COUPLE 
OF DIFFERENT THINGS TO TAKE 
AWAY. 
ONE, OR BROKEN STRATEGISTS ARE 
PUSHING THAT SHE IS SO FAR GONE 
THAT THE RACE IS OVER AND SHE 
IS TAKING WITH DEMOCRATS IN THE 
FINAL DAYS HERE AND ANOTHER WAY 
TO LOOK AT IT IS THAT SHE IS 
GOING WITH HER GUT AND WHERE 
SHE THINKS SHE SHOULD BE AND 
PERHAPS TRYING TO MOTIVATE 
REPUBLICANS -- SORRY, SOME 
DEMOCRATS THAT MIGHT NOT TURN 
UP IN A PLACE LIKE NORTH DAKOTA.
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS BUT 
WITH HER OUT OF THE GAME, THAT 
PUTS THE SPOTLIGHT RIGHT BACK 
ON JOE MANSION. 
>> I WAS GOING TO ASK ABOUT 
THAT.  
WE DO NOT KNOW IF HE WILL CROSS 
THE AISLE. 
HE HAS A CLOSE RACE.  TALK TO 
ME ABOUT THE MATH? 
>> IT WILL BE INTERESTING 
BECAUSE  MANSION AND JOE 
DONNELLY HAVE CROSSED THE AISLE 
LAST YEAR TO VOTE FOR NEIL SO 
EVERYONE WAS LOOKING AT THEM AS 
A BAROMETER FOR WHERE THE RED 
STATE DEMOCRATS MIGHT BE. 
WE HAVE NOW SEEN DONNELLY AND 
HEITKAMP SAYING NO. 
THEN YOU HAVE MANSION. 
HIS DATE LOVES TRUMP AND THERE 
IS A LOT OF PRESSURE ON HIM. 
HE IS REALLY ON HIS OWN HERE. 
I TALKED TO A REPORT IN 
STRATEGISTS WHO HANGS IS 
MANSION DOES IN FACT VOTE FOR 
KAVANAUGH, HE THINKS HE CAN PUT 
THE RACE AWAY  BUT IF HE VOTES 
AGAINST IT, THERE WILL BE A LOT 
OF PRESSURE POINTS COMING FOR 
HIM. 
ALL EYES ON HIM AND ESPECIALLY 
IF THESE REPUBLICANS VOTE NO ON 
KAVANAUGH, DOES MENTION THAT 
WITH THEM OR CROSSOVER  AND 
MAKE UP THE VOTES OF THEIR 
PELICANS NEED? 
>> I WANT TO ASK ABOUT  LISA 
MURKOWSKI. 
TALK ABOUT THE INTERNAL POLITICS
.  
>> THAT IS A GOOD POINT AND THE 
GOVERNOR HAS COME OUT IN 
OPPOSITION TO KAVANAUGH . THERE 
ARE A LOT OF NATIVE AMERICAN 
RESISTANCE TO KAVANAUGH OVER 
HIS RULINGS  REGARDING TRIBAL 
RIGHTS SO THAT COULD BE AN 
ISSUE THAT IS PLAYING AND SHE 
HAS BEEN GETTING A LOT OF 
PRESSURE BACK HOME ON THE ISSUE 
ALONE AND THEN YOU HAVE TO 
CONSIDER IN THE WAY SHE HAS 
BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALL THIS. 
WE HAVE HEARD OF HER -- OTHER 
CENTERS TALK FAVORABLY BUT FOR 
HER, SHE HAS BEEN A WILDCARD. 
LISA MURKOWSKI HAS ENGAGED  THE 
DEBATE OVER ME TOO AND WHAT 
THIS MEANS IN THE LARGER 
CONTEXT. 
YOU CAN IMAGINE A SITUATION 
WHERE SHE DOES NOT FEEL 
COMPELLED TO VOTE FOR HIM. 
>> IT HAS BEEN ALMOST A WEEK  AS
JEFF FLAKE MADE THE 
ANNOUNCEMENT CALLING FOR THE 
FBI INVESTIGATION. 
WOULD YOU SAY THIS IS REALLY A 
GIFT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY 
WHILE -- FOR CALLING FOR THIS 
INVESTIGATION? 
>> IT COULD UNIFY THEM AND HELP 
TO SUPPORT KAVANAUGH  EVEN 
AFTER THE ALLEGATIONS SURFACED. 
>> YOU COULD LOOK AT IT IN A 
WAY THAT JEFF  FLAKE PROVIDED 
SOME COVER BECAUSE THERE WAS 
SOME ANXIETY ABOUT NOMINATING 
KAVANAUGH  OR CONFIRMING 
KAVANAUGH WITH THESE 
ALLEGATIONS OUT THERE . 
REPUBLICANS AS YOU HEARD SEEMED 
PRETTY EMBOLDENED BY THIS 
REPORT BECAUSE THEY THINK 
ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY LIMITED IN 
SCOPE BY THE WHITE HOUSE AND 
THAT IS SOMETHING BEING 
CONTESTED, REPUBLICANS FEEL 
THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO SAY WE 
DID ANOTHER BACKGROUND 
INVESTIGATION BY THE FBI WHICH 
IS INDEPENDENT HERE AND THEY 
DID NOT FIND THE EVIDENCE 
NEEDED TO CORROBORATE THIS.  
THEY FILL THIS WILL GIVE SOME 
MOMENTUM AND WE HAVE CERTAINLY 
SEEN THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE 
RALLIED AROUND THIS CAUSE. 
THIS IS SIMILAR TO HOW WE SAW 
DONE IN 2016 OVER THE ISSUE OF 
THE SUPREME COURT. 
>>  WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER 
MANSION WILL CROSS THE AISLE OR 
NOT BUT PUTTING DEMOCRATS 
ASIDE, LET'S SAY THEY DON'T 
HAVE ANY AT THIS POINT, HOW 
MANY REPUBLICANS DO THEY NEED? 
>> IT IS SUCH A NARROW MARGIN. 
REMEMBER WHEN JONES  WON THAT 
SEAT? 
LET ME THE MARGIN FOR CONTROL 
RAZOR THIN. 
THEY CAN ONLY LOSE ONE VOTE AND 
THEN MIKE PENCE COULD COME IN 
AND BE A TIEBREAKER. 
YOU CAN IMAGINE A SCENARIO IN 
WHICH MURKOWSKI VOTES NO BUT 
MANSION VOTES YES. 
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE 
CONFERENCE TOGETHER AND WHY 
THERE IS SO MUCH CONCERN. 
>> WHY DO YOU THINK THE 
SENATORS  HAVE THIS BIG 
DRAMATIC ROLLOUT, WHY CAN'T 
THEY TELL US ABOUT THIS? 
>> THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION. 
NO ONE WANTS TO BE A DECIDING 
VOTE ON ANYTHING  AND 
ESPECIALLY SOMETHING THAT IS 
GIVING SUCH A REACTION ON ALL 
SIDES TO THIS NOMINATION. 
IF YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT, YOU DO 
NOT WANT TO BE THE DECIDING 
VOTE FOR OR AGAINST HIM. 
THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE REMOVED 
THAT ELEMENT BUT THE OTHER 
THING IS THAT IT DOES ALLOW 
REPUBLICANS TO SAY WE TOOK A 
WEEK AND NOW WE ARE GOING INTO 
FRIDAY AND WE TOOK SEVERAL DAYS 
TO VET THIS OUT AGAIN AND IT 
DID NOT COME BACK WITH ANYTHING 
SO THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE 
SOMETHING TO STAND ON. 
DEMOCRATS FEEL THAT THIS WILL 
RALLY THE TROOPS AND THERE IS 
THE QUESTION OF HOW MUCH HIGHER 
THAT ENTHUSIASM CAN GO. THEY 
THINK THEY HAVE AN ARGUMENT TO 
MAKE WHICH IS THAT THE WHITE 
HOUSE IS IN CONTROL OF THE BEST 
PATIENT AND THEY ORDERED THE 
FBI TO TALK TO CERTAIN PEOPLE 
AND THEY THINK THEY COULD HAVE 
DONE A BETTER JOB. 
>> THANK YOU FOR BREAK
