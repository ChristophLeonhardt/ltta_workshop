another top story tonight new heat on Donald Trump over border policies now even though he partly backed down a family separation now 18 attorneys general filing the first lawsuit against Trump to permanently stop the policy today they say they're a constitutional due process rights and equal protection violations Trump of course doubling down on a critique that shows the either doesn't know or doesn't care how judges in this system work also the idea of deporting people without due process as well find a system where you don't need thousands of judges sitting at a border other countries look at us and they think we're crazy they say what kind of a thing is that and one of my next guests argues it's a mistake to view the immigration fight and the Muller fight and also this trade war separately because Donald Trump uses all of them to abuse his authority and they're part of a creeping king-like attack on checks and balances consider that when you look at Trump doing something today that would literally be illegal if Congress passed a law to the same effect targeting a company harley-davidson to be taxed like never before because it's responded to his own trade war by moving production overseas so let's get to these guests I'm joined by Mike Murphy and MSNBC political analyst with Republican experienced Jake Holman Dory an analyst with Democratic experience at Christina Greer a fellow at NYU's mix silver Institute welcome to all J you argue that these all run together the Harley Davidson thing is not just Twitter talk right what do you mean well I think that the way the media has covered the Muller investigation and the Trump policies they put them in separate boxes but I think it's more accurate to look at it as one contiguous story the Putin ization of America now when we look at the Russia investigation it's been presented as a direct exchange of goods Putin helps Trump with the election Trump gives Putin a pro Russia foreign policy well a better way to look at it is it's a collaboration between Trump and Putin to make America more like Putin's Russia and you can see this with a harley-davidson case going after harley-davidson and and Amazon as well you know these sorts of companies Crosse Trump's path is exactly what Vladimir Putin has done in Russia to build the crony capitalism that is a hallmark of the Russian state right and the irony being that Donald Trump notoriously struggled to build his business is the traditional way I mean he's not Elon Musk he's not Bill Gates correct uh and then you add to the Year evidence the fact that he openly admires the leaders of North Korea in Russia oh yes absolutely I mean that's something that's very Harmar Computing's foreign policy is the support for dictators around the world I mean that is something about Anna Putin very much does and Donald Trump follows suit rhetorically and also in practice he does run a pro Russia foreign policy by any estimation and Mike Murphy one of the mistakes of perhaps the hyperventilating over reaction of Donald Trump is that there's no proportion and a lot of other people around the country may say well yeah some of this is bad but is it all the worst thing ever when you remove the T word and you just look at how people feel about democracy right now look at this Mike seventy nine percent of Americans which includes obviously conservatives concern about the condition of democracy in America your your view of the other points that a raises well I'm the poll first I think that is very telling we're in a tribal politics now where the slogan on both sides is I'm right you're evil so I can do or say anything about you because I'm fighting evil and that's a very dangerous construct totally cheapens political dialogue because there's no argument just an insult contest of absolute so I think that is a bad thing for democracy and in some ways I'm happy to see people are hip to it because there will be a Reformation I hope in the future I'm not quite there on the unified field theory about Trump and Putin but I do agree that Trump definitely has autocratic tendencies I don't think he ever studied the presidency I don't think he understands the institution he thinks his job is to bark orders and crush dissent to him everything is personal there's no ideology other than the culture around Trump and so you see companies like harley-davidson that are victims here still getting his ire because they've offended his delicate sensibilities and so you take that into account and Christina listen to Donald Trump at a rally last night touting the unbending loyalty that he perceives so this announcer says what can he do and you've heard me say this because this happens a lot what can he do where you won't be with him what can he do when you're gonna drop Donald Trump and one of these women stood out perhaps the leader perhaps not but she came forward and she said there's absolutely nothing he can do can you believe that there is nothing he can do so this is you know I think I disagree with the right versus evil I mean in so many different ways what Democrats are saying is you know there on one side and supporters of Trump are saying we can take thousands of children away from their parents with no receipt I think this Trump sort of consistently going to his rallies which he needs because he's a boy King and he thinks that the presidency is just him marching around demanding things he's never had a board of directors as I brought up before but I think what's really important to remember the words of LBJ where he was very clear when he told his colleagues that if you convince the poorest white man that they're better than the negro you can pick his pocket all day long and I think for many Trump supporters working class and also middle and upper class he's convinced then that immigrants are the the enemy Mexicans explicitly are rapists and terrorists and vermin which he's stated several times and because of that he's convinced them that they are superior in a white supremacist fashion to other citizens and undocumented individuals who are in this country and that allows him to do whatever he quote-unquote needs to do by the long keep in mind lots of news were legal for many times shadow slavery being one of them Jim Crow being another where just because legal on the books does not mean it's correct or the thing that we should be doing is American well to your to your point Christina and with that that ties by the travel ban the fact that it was upheld today as constitutional doesn't resolve the questions of whether Americans think it's a good idea on a lighter note you're calling him a boy king previously on this broadcast you've referred to him as a quote man baby so it seems that he may be growing up before your eyes well for these purposes I think about him and his wife and her anti-bullying campaign clearly is not working hashtag be better Melania because this is a man who goes to Twitter right to talk about not just Yelp reviews of restaurants but to actually you know they not even thinly veil a sitting member of Congress I mean I think we've moved beyond the point where this person doesn't understand or respect the office of the presidency and we know the only way this Constitution is going to work is if we have an equilateral triangle of Congress the courts and the president working together maybe we're seeing the president take the store and let me get responses from Mike and then check well I I'm a trump critic not a trump defender but I think it's wider than that a trump is a grievance candidate and he uses race and that's the shame of them but there are other grievance candidates on both sides Bernie Sanders is a grievance candidate but he doesn't to his credit use race there's a lot of dreams' in our politics now because the great American middle class was stagnant wages for a long time in real buying power is really really mad at the political system and that creates an environment where these characters can run on the I'm right you're evil equation on both sides now Trump is put it on miracle-gro steroids so the biggest shame is on him he's set a new level but this is systemic now in our politics and it's a bad thing let me go to Jay briefly yeah I think it's much deeper than grievance I think what Trump practices is cruelty his part of his brand is cruelty and you get to go back to like the idea of Vladimir Putin that is a big part of the brand of Ivan Putin other dictators you simply have to show the opposition what you're capable of that's exactly why we had the crisis that we have on the border Donald Trump is trying that was on some level he's trying to show people what he is capable of doing that type of cruelty is very important in terms of intimidating people I think it goes much deeper than just agreements and that's why that's why the references to authoritarianism are substantive not just rhetorical hey I'm already Melvin from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our youtube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that
