>>APPARENTLY THE PENTAGON HAD A
FASCINATING ARGENT CALLED
ADVANCED AEROSPACE THREAT
IDENTIFICATION PROGRAM.
IF YOU
ARE THE PENTAGON YOU WANT TO
IDENTIFY THREATS IN THE AIR,
THAT MAKES SENSE.
WERE THEY
TRYING TO IDENTIFY CHINESE OR
RUSSIAN THREATS?
NO.
INDIAN,
PAKISTANI?
NO.
UFOS, ALIEN
THREATS.
AWESOME.
THIS WHOLE
STORY IS MADE OF AWESOME.
AT THE
END I WILL SHOW YOU A VIDEO OF A
UFO.
I THINK.
AND APPARENTLY THE
U.S. GOVERNMENT THINKS.
HOLD FOR
IT BECAUSE YOU WANT ALL THE
DETAILS OF THIS STORY.
THE NEW YORK TIMES WROTE THIS,
THEY EXPLAINED THAT THERE WAS A
GROUP, AND --
>>ALREADY IT'S COOL.
FROM NO
ONE, ANYTHING THAT IS SECRETIVE
I WILL SAY THAT'S ON THE FIFTH
FLOOR OF THE C RING, WHICH IS
GREAT.
THEY EXPLAIN THAT THIS
PROGRAM RAN FOR A LITTLE WHILE,
IT MIGHT STILL BE RUNNING, AND
THE PENTAGON LOOKED INTO THIS IN
THE PAST.
LET ME GIVE YOU
DETAILS --
>> THAT'S OUR
OLD ALIEN BEEP.
OKAY --
>>YOUR UNCLE HARRY WHO'S HALFWAY
THERE AND HALFWAY NOT THERE
MENTALLY, HE COMES OVER AT
THANKSGIVING AND COMES OVER AND
TELLS YOU ABOUT UFOS THAT DID X
AND Y AND Z TO HIM, YOU SAY
MAYBE, MAYBE NOT.
BUT MOST OF
THIS DATA IS COLLECTED FROM U.S.
SERVICEMEMBERS.
DOES THAT MEAN
THAT A GUY BECAUSE HE'S IN THE
MILITARY IS BY DEFINITION MORE
TRUSTWORTHY?
NOT NECESSARILY OF
COURSE, BUT WHEN BOB COMES IN
AND TELLS ME LOOK MAN, I KNOW
HOW AIRCRAFT ACT, THEY DON'T ACT
THAT WAY, I GIVE THAT'S ZERO
CREDIBILITY.
WHEN A NAVY PILOT
IS IN THE AIR AND HE SEES A UFO
AND SAYS AN AIRCRAFT DOESN'T ACT
THAT WAY, I GIVE IT A LOT MORE
CREDIBILITY.
IT'S NOT THE END
ALL BE ALL, BUT PRETTY
INTERESTING.
LET'S GO BACK FROM
WHEN THEY ORIGINALLY STARTED
DOING PROGRAMS LIKE THIS AND
FIND OUT WHAT THEY FOUND OUT
BACK THEN, WHEN WE HAD A LOT
LESS TECHNOLOGY AT OUR DISPOSAL
--
>> BUT THAT
WAS BACK THEN, AND WE JUST
DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH
TECHNOLOGY, AND PEOPLE BELIEVED
IN MORE KOOKY STUFF BACK THEN.
SO MORE GRAIN OF SALT, OKAY.
NOW
LET'S COME BACK TO WHAT WAS
HAPPENING RECENTLY --
>>HEY, HARRY REID DID SOMETHING
IN THE SENATE.
BLESS HIS HEART.
AND IF HE FOUND ALIENS, OKAY,
MAYBE HE RESCUED HIS LEGACY A
LITTLE BIT.
BY THE WAY, I LIKE
PROJECT BLUE BOOK.
IF SOMEBODY
COMES TO ME AND SAYS DO YOU WANT
TO BE INVOLVED IN PROJECT BLUE
BOOK, MY ANSWER IS A DEFINITIVE
YES OR A DEFINITIVE NO.
BECAUSE
IT EITHER INVOLVES MURDERING
SOMEBODY OR FINDING ALIENS.
I'M
IN FOR THE ALIEN PART, NOT FOR
THE MURDER.
YOU CAN TELL I FIND
THE STORY COOL BUT THEY HAVE
REAL EVIDENCE WE WILL GET TO IN
A SECOND.
WHERE DID THE MONEY
COME FROM?
WELL --
>>NOW, THE MONEY THAT WAS
ALLOCATED TO IT WAS TINY, ONLY
$22 MILLION OUT OF AT THE TIME A
$600 BILLION PENTAGON BUDGET.
MILLION, NOT BILLION, A VERY
SMALL NUMBER FOR THE PENTAGON.
I
DON'T LIKE THAT IT WENT TO HARRY
REID'S FRIEND, YOU CAN'T
APPARENTLY DO ANYTHING IN THE
SENATE WITHOUT AT LEAST A LITTLE
CORRUPTION SPRINKLED IN, THEY
WOULD ARGUE IT'S NOT, BUT I WISH
IT WENT TO SOMEONE WHO WAS NOT A
FRIEND OF THE GUY WHO FINANCED
IT THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT.
BUT
ANYWAY, EVEN HARRY REID SAYS --
>>IT WAS THOSE THREE SENATORS
THAT OKAYED IT.
ALSO THE FIRST
TIME BLACK MONEY HAS EVER BEEN
USED IN A POSITIVE CONNOTATION,
USUALLY BLACK MONEY IS, OH, THAT
THING WHERE WE SENT A LOT OF
MONEY AND WEAPONS DOWN TO
NICARAGUA AND 22,000 CIVILIANS
DIED, THAT WAS BLACK MONEY.
OR
OH, A BUNCH OF BILLIONAIRE
DONORS GOT TOGETHER AND GOT
THEMSELVES $1 TRILLION TAX CUT.
THAT WAS BLACK MONEY.
THIS IS
BLACK MONEY OR DARK MONEY THAT
WENT TO SOMETHING INTERESTING,
TRY TO SEE IF THERE IS UFOS.
BUT
NOTICE, BY THE WAY, THOSE TWO
SENATORS WHO APPROVED IT BACK
THEN APPARENTLY IN A SECURED
ROOM IN THE CAPITAL WHICH IS
THOSE THREE SENATORS, RIED IS
NOW RETIRED, INOUYE HAS PASSED
AWAY, AND SO HAS STEVENS.
THEY
WERE BOTH REALLY OLD.
NOW BACK
TO BIGELOW, THE ONE DOING THE
RESEARCH.
YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN
HIM ON 60 MINUTES, HE'S VERY
WEALTHY, AND HE'S CERTAINLY VERY
POSITIVE ABOUT WHETHER THERE ARE
ALIEN FORCES ON THIS PLANET AND
WHETHER THEY HAVE REACHED OUT TO
US.
HE EXPLAINED THAT HE WAS --
>>LET ME BREAK DOWN THAT
SENTENCE BECAUSE DO ALIENS
EXIST?
ALMOST CERTAINLY,
99.999% CHANCE, AND YOU CAN KEEP
GOING WITH THOSE NINES.
WE ARE
THE ONLY THING IN THE WHOLE
UNIVERSE WITH BILLIONS OF STARS
AND GALAXIES AND PLANETS, WE ARE
THE ONLY SENTIMENT LIFE FORMS IN
THE UNIVERSE?
THAT'S
PREPOSTEROUS, ALMOST CERTAINLY
NOT THE CASE, IT'S EGOTISTICAL
TO ARGUE IT WOULD BE THE CASE
AND I WOULD ARGUE BORDERLINE
IGNORANT.
WHETHER THEY HAVE
VISITED EARTH, THE SECOND PART,
IS A DIFFERENT MATTER AND THAT
REQUIRES EVIDENCE, AND
PREVIOUSLY WE HAD NOT HAD IT.
SO
LET'S DIVE IN A LITTLE BIT MORE.
WE ARE WORKING OUR WAY TOWARDS
THE VIDEO HERE --
>>INTERESTING.
THIS 
GUY IS
CONVINCED ALIENS EXIST, I DON'T
KNOW IF HE BECAME CONVINCED
BECAUSE OF THE PROJECT OR HE WAS
CONVINCED BEFORE THE PROJECT,
THAT WOULD AFFECT HIS
CREDIBILITY A LITTLE BUT
REMEMBER THEY ARE GATHERING THE
EVIDENCE LARGELY FROM U.S.
MILITARY MEMBERS AND OTHER
CREDIBLE SOURCES.
OKAY --
>>THAT STUFF IS REAL, MAN.
DO
WITH THAT INFORMATION WHATEVER
YOU LIKE, LET ME GIVE YOU A
COUPLE MORE FACTS BEFORE THE
VIDEO.
THEY SAID THEY COLLECTED
--
>>I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY KNOW
THAT IT WAS RECOVERED FROM THOSE
UFOS, IF THEY KNOW THAT, BUT
BOY, THAT'S INTERESTING.
ALSO --
>>BUT REMEMBER, A LOT OF THIS
IS STILL CLASSIFIED SO WE DON'T
KNOW IF THERE WERE ANY
PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES AND WHAT
RESULTS THERE WERE.
ALSO --
>>AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
BUCKLE UP, BRACE FOR IMPACT,
THIS APPEARS TO BE A U.S.
MILITARY PLANE AND ITS CREW
COMING INTO CONTACT WITH AN
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.
WATCH.
>>THEY DIDN'T HAVE ME UNTIL IT
ROTATED.
THEN WHEN IT ROTATED I
WAS LIKE, OH, THAT'S
INTERESTING.
BECAUSE AN
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT,
COULD IT BE THAT THE CHINESE
HAVE COME UP WITH A DRONE THAT
IS AMAZING AND COULD DO THAT
STUFF?
MAY BE.
BUT IF IT'S NOT
MAYBE THE CHINESE, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE OTHER MAYBE IS.
SO
MIND BLOWN.
HOLD.
HERE COMES
ELIZONDO, HE WAS IN CHARGE OF
THE PROGRAM, HE RAN IT UNTIL THE
FINANCING RAN OUT IN 2012,
HE CONTINUED TO RUN IT WHEN IT
WASN'T TECHNICALLY FINANCED,
THEN IN OCTOBER HE RESIGNED
AND NOW HAS COME PUBLIC, LET'S
LISTEN.
>>LET ME ASK YOU THE QUESTION,
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT LIFE FROM
SOMEWHERE ELSE WHILE YOU WERE IN
THIS PROGRAM CAME HERE, VISITED,
OBSERVED?
>>I WILL TELL YOU UNEQUIVOCALLY
THAT THROUGH THE OBSERVATION,
SCIENTIFIC METHODOLOGIES THAT
WERE APPLIED TO LOOK AT THIS
PHENOMENA, THAT THESE AIRCRAFT,
WE WILL CALL THEM AIRCRAFT, OR
DISPLAYING CHARACTERISTICS THAT
ARE NOT CURRENTLY WITHIN THE
U.S. INVENTORY, NOR IN ANY
FOREIGN INVENTORY THAT WE ARE
AWARE OF.
>>I LOVE HOW MILITARY GUYS
TALK.
IT IS NOT CURRENTLY IN THE
U.S. MILITARY INVENTORY, NOR IN
ANY INVENTORY WE ARE AWARE OF.
ALREADY SOUNDS BADASS.
BURNETT DOING A GOOD JOB WITH
THE FOLLOW-UP QUESTION,
LET'S WATCH.
>>YOU ARE BEING CLEAR, BUT THE
ANSWER IS YES?
>>I CAN'T SPEAK ON BEHALF OF
THE GOVERNMENT, OBVIOUSLY, I'M
NOT IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT
ANYMORE, MY PERSONAL BELIEF IS
THAT THERE IS COMPELLING
EVIDENCE THAT WE MAY NOT BE
ALONE.
WHATEVER THAT MEANS.
>>HERE'S WHAT IT MEANS, [LASER
SOUND EFFECT].
THEY'RE HERE.
LOOK, GUYS, I DON'T KNOW.
OF
COURSE I DON'T KNOW.
IT REQUIRES
EVIDENCE.
BEFORE THERE WAS NO
EVIDENCE THAT WE KNEW OF
PUBLICLY, NOW THERE IS SOME.
MAKE OF IT WHAT YOU WILL.
AND I
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT.
AND IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT
THEY ARE UNIDENTIFIED AND WILL
LATER BE IDENTIFIED AND WE WILL
FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HELL IS
GOING ON.
I NEED AN ALIEN BAN
UNTIL WE FIGURE OUT WHAT THE
HELL IS GOING ON.
WE HAVE TO BAN
PEOPLE COMING IN FROM OTHER
GALAXIES.
IT'S EXCITING TIMES.
AND THE OTHER THING THAT TRIPPED
ME OUT FROM THAT VIDEO IS WHEN
THE PILOT SAID, QUOTE, THERE'S A
WHOLE FLEET OF THEM.
[LASER
SOUND EFFECT] WOW.
THAT'S ALL
I'VE GOT TO SAY ABOUT THAT.
