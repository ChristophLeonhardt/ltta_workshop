to Squarespace comm slash tyt or use the promo code tyt Donald Trump has been accused of calling Jeff Sessions retarded and that was one of the claims made in Bob Woodward's new book fear and so Trump also specifically allegedly called out Jeff Sessions for being a dumb southerner and that is not playing well with some members of Trump's base and it certainly isn't playing well with some Republican lawmakers from the south so just to give you the specifics the book recounts Trump making pointed remarks such as mentally retarded and dumb southerner and claimed that Trump had mocked the Attorney General southern twang behind his back now Trump has denied this and he has denied it strongly mostly because of the fact that this would hurt him politically if he didn't strongly deny it he says the following the already discredited it has not been discredited the already discredited Woodward book so many lies and phony sources has me calling Jeff Sessions quote mentally retarded and a dumb southerner I said neither never used those terms on anyone including Jeff and being a southerner is a great thing he made this up to divide so interesting things have happened since these allegations since Trump's denial of the allegations people are now coming out of the woodwork like they're just coming out and they're like hey yo I got I got evidence of him using this type of rhetoric in regard to people he doesn't like people he disagrees with and so Howard Stern shared some video from 2004 when Trump was on his show and we had a little montage for you so let's take a look that's right and you know tell me that one I have a golf pro who's mentally retiming he's like really not a smart guy I was criticized in one magazine where the writer was retarded Donald $7,000,000 so that's the guy who said I've never used the term you're on tape you schmuck he man he that's why he's pathological he can't help but lie non-stop yeah it doesn't matter that he's gonna get caught that's two different Howard Stern interviews from the same year from oh four but and he knows he said those things he probably said those things a hundred times but he comes to answer never use that word never know but you don't get it jank it's this weird deep state conspiracy where they found someone who has his exact looks his exact voice and they made that actor this crisis actor and then they even took the video and lowered the quality of it to make it look like it was from 2004 I mean it's amazing what they get is amazing yeah by the way so who are the lawmakers who are not happy about what Trump said about southerners you have senator Johnny Isakson from Georgia he was quoted as saying I'm a southerner people can judge my intellect my IQ by my product and what I produce rather than what somebody else says hold on here because this is really important it's important for two reasons first of all if they thought it wasn't a real story Isakson would have said am I gonna respond to that that's nonsense that's not true or the president said no such thing even if he was like 20% on certain 80 percent Oh sir it doesn't matter he wouldn't have said hey I'm not a dumb southerner he knows Trump said it that's why he says look you judge me by my IQ and by my actions he is directing that at the president because he knows just like everybody in Washington knows of course Trump said it the second reason this is the most important part of this story if he loses those Republican senators in the south and then they'll be asking him who's retarded now right and so look in it's a word and to be fair to Donald Trump so it's a word that's deeply offensive and and so by the way do you think other Republicans might have also used it of course and to be fair to trump it was you know for it was not considered as offensive now some people will say no no it was very very offensive I I get you but it's considered far more offensive today okay so I'm giving you all that because that's this story isn't about that it's about his non-stop lies his non-stop attack against his own administration officials and and against fellow Republicans it's gonna catch up with them this is those Republican senators in the South saying these comments is that moment catching up to Donald Trump yes okay and it get much worse if we now talk start talking about impeachment and those guys go oh what did you say about dumb southerners again so senator Isakson from Georgia isn't the only lawmaker who came out and said something about this you also have Richard Shelby from Alabama who said this I guess the president he says what he thinks I think the president's probably got a lot of respect for the south I hope so he did well there without the south he wouldn't be the President of the United States again clearly he thinks Trump did say it that's why he says the president says what he thinks and this is all this is political speak for you better watch yourself and of course Trump can't do that now look we keep using the same word because it's in the context of this story I'm gonna say it one last time because there's also another amazing instance of Donald Trump using it it was in the case of Marlee Matlin so she is an actress who is deaf she was on apprentice with Donald Trump and this is so disgusting yeah the way what he said about her he asked quote Marlee if she retarded he said Trump a person who worked on the show said Trump would make fun of her voice he said like to make it seem like she was mentally not there it sounded like he got a real kick out of it it was really upsetting now there's so many layers to that because Donald Trump's too stupid to realize she's deaf has no actual mental issues he's the one with mental issues who thinks Oh person who sounds funny is probably not bright oh my god okay and I know it's by the way the idea of Trump going around talking about people not being bright is amazing like that's not lost on us we know right but this whole debate about him using that word is relevant and I would give anything to have an opportunity to sit down with Sarah Palin who supports Donald Trump and ask her what she thinks about these statements because if you could remember rahm emanuel had called progressives okay effing retarded mm-hm and that was deeply offensive not just to progresses but to everyone who you know disagrees with the use of that word sarah palin was angry about it remember she made a big deal about it because one of her children has a disability that's right that's right rahm emanuel of course former chief staff to Barack Obama and and a guy who hates progressives and part of the reason Obama hired him so we keep it real on both fronts and now that's why we ask who Sarah Palin actually gonna be honest when it's about a Republican and and my guess is probably not she certainly has not spoken out about this and she jumped all over the rahm emanuel comments right another case of hypocrisy here the degree to which Marlee Matlin is smarter than Donald Trump is indescribable but this is another you know thing that Trump does which is unbearable he tax people with disabilities you remember the reporter with disability that he famously made remember we have video of that this is him talking about Sergey Kowalewski a reporter who has a disability written by a nice reporter now the poor guy you gotta see this guy I don't know what I said I don't remember he's gonna like I don't remember I had the old baby that's what I said he is unbelievable you imagine if Obama did that unthinkable unthinkable and then I I the line that always sticks out for me i people are forgotten because he's done so many thousands of crazy stupid things but when he was talking about the Paralympics and he's like oh they're good brave people I've been a little tough to watch who says that while you're speaking in front of people who participate in the Paralympics it's unbelievable you're the president the NSA because he's too stupid to understand that's not a thing you say in that context or any context okay and that's who he is I mean this story is littered with irony of the most mentally challenged person in in public life in America going around calling other people mentally retarded but the most important part of story is not that it's that he's on borrowed time he is alienated anyone who would stick up for him and who could help him in Washington he has no allies left when you have no allies left tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick - easy wasteful Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button
