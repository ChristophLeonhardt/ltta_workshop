to begin with the president's former attorney and self-proclaimed fixer Michael Cohen claiming to know the answer to a pair of questions Americans have been asking for more than a year what did President Trump know about that 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer and when did he know it I've got a great panel to break it all down but first let me explain what we know so far a source tells NBC News that Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Kelly Cohen is willing to tell Special Counsel Robert Muller that Trump knew about the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting before it took place specifically that Trump's eldest son told him about it in advance now you may remember that meeting during the 2016 campaign between Don Jr Jared Kushner Paul Manafort and several Russian nationals including an attorney who was linked to the Kremlin at that meeting Russians were expecting to provide or expected to provide damaging information on Hillary Clinton the president has repeatedly denied knowing about the meeting before it happened including in this interview with the New York Times last year no I didn't know anything about the minutes because you get this must have been a very important must have been a very unimportant meeting you've even heard about Donald Trump jr. has made that made the thought the tough to believe claimed more than once that he never told his father about that meeting a lot of people gonna want to know this about your father hmm did you tell your father anything about that oh it was such a nothing there was nothing to tell I wouldn't even remembered it until we start scouring through the stuff it was literally just a waste of twenty minutes which was a shame I'd remember a meeting like that anyway Donald Trump jr. told congressional investigators the same thing in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee he said quote I wouldn't have wasted his time with it I never spoke to my father about it Don jr. standing by that this morning remember he cannot say he lied to Congress because that would be a crime his attorney telling NBC News quote we are very confident of the accuracy and reliability of the information that has been provided by mr. Trump jr. and on his behalf Michael Cohen's lawyer Lanny Davis said he had no comment so we still don't know who's telling the truth or what Donald Trump knew but here's what then the candidate Donald Trump said remember this four days after his son was first contacted about the meeting and offered dirt on Hillary Clinton and two days before the meeting actually took place I am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week and we're going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons I think you're gonna find it very informative and very very president's lawyer Rudy Giuliani's dismissing the new report he's going after Michael Cohen's credibility here's what he said last night moments after the news broke there's no doubt in my mind that he's just not credible I would not accept him as a witness as a prosecutor if if Mel has any other kind of case this is the kind of witness that can really destroy your whole case because they any finder of fact loses confidence in the case when you rely on a guy like this when you rely on a guy where before you finish with them you're gonna have such a string of lies you you just can't trust him and when you put them in this kind of pressure and what's its history Ben is this you've been lying under pressure hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
