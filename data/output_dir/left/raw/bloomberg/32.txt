1
00:00:00,635 --> 00:00:02,795
We all make poor life choices

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,740
take these two guys for example

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,040
They're the founders of a self driving car company called Zoox

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,320
and they've decided it makes sense to try and compete against this

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,680
Waymo the Google self driving car project, Cruise Automation, Daimler, Baidu, Uber, and Lyft

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,940
But Zoox is different. its rivals are adding self driving technology to existing cars

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,140
Meanwhile Zoox is making a new type of vehicle

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,760
for the self driving age

9
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,680
basically Zoox is making a robot

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:52,560
and its early incarnation. Looks like the love child of the Matrix, Mad Max, and Transformers franchises

11
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,940
This is Tim Kentley-Klay

12
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:00,640
He hails from Australia and Down Under he was a well-known designer and ad guy

13
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:08,040
One day he had an epiphany. A vision of the future full of robotic vehicles and came here to build them

14
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,060
I sort of saw the future of how the whole system could work

15
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,020
I said ok I need to find a brilliant computer scientist

16
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,840
so that led me on a journey for six months actually where I ended up finding Jesse

17
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,280
That brilliant computer scientist is Dr. Jesse Levinson

18
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,280
A Stanford grad who was sought after by none other than Google itself

19
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,520
I actually visited a Google X in 2013 to come and speak on my vision for autonomy

20
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,160
In talking a fellow he there's one guy and he's really good and we can't get him

21
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,960
that was my signal to go and get him

22
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:47,300
a lot of your colleagues have run off to companies like Google or or Uber to retrofit their cars

23
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,375
What drew you to this particular task

24
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,360
and this approach

25
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,880
I've been working on some driving cars since 2005 and

26
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,660
it's pretty clear even back then that there's going to be one of the more transformative technologies for society

27
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,095
It wasn't enough to just solve the technology

28
00:02:02,095 --> 00:02:05,075
You need a product and you need a business that makes sense

29
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,240
And I hadn't seen that in any other company until I met Tim and he shared his high level vision

30
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,580
For what Zoox could be

31
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,860
And that vision is a system of completely autonomous robotic vehicles

32
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,980
that can be summoned just like a Lyft, or dare I saw it, an Uber

33
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,640
We have a very clear vision at Zoox

34
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,640
which is that AI and mobility will take us out of the age of the automobile

35
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,340
and into the next mobility age which for us is robotics autonomous transportation

36
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,480
Tim and Jesse take me to the Alameda Naval Air Station

37
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,840
where I'm about to get a test drive and see how a Zooks robot handles

38
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,480
these are very unique vehicles. They're designed in a way that would only make sense

39
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,800
if they're going to be fully autonomous

40
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,800
The power trains are designed for full autonomy they are fully redundant and they have joule high voltage

41
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,140
batteries they have joule low voltage architectures

42
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,000
you can see that rigged with computer sensors. They can drive without any human intervention

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,620
This is VH4. This is VH5

44
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,700
You want to go for a ride?. Yeah I do. All right. Jump in

45
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,440
Zoox has placed cones on the tarmac. The robot is going to drive out and try to dodge them

46
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,360
And I get to do the whole test sitting backwards because Tim thought it would be funny

47
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,200
time to meet my robot maker

48
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,500
and with one swift keystroke I give complete control of my life over to an ai

49
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,340
That really doesn't get old.

50
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,740
It's like being at a ride at Disney.

51
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,860
These AI robots crank through the course at forty five miles per hour.

52
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:00,300
And the VH5 is set to rip through it at a delightful seventy five miles per hour

53
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,100
We can choose all wheel steering, two wheel steering, crab steering,

54
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,880
dual Motors

55
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,400
and then we have direction

56
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,560
I like the crab Steering.

57
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:19,400
Zoox got its start here in this abandoned firehouse back in 2015 with only six employees

58
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,820
They've since raised an astonishing eight hundred million dollars

59
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,960
and have expanded their operations into a one stop robot making shop

60
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,240
With the help of 400 employees.

61
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,740
Zoox now on their way to turning these prototypes into full fledged vehicles by 2020

62
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,980
For the moment though Zoox does most of its software testing in these

63
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:52,700
Modified versions of Toyota Highlander's which have the decided advantage of being street legal.

64
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:58,300
We’re actually going to get you to drive autonomously from this facility to our new headquarters in Foster City

65
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,680
And then Jesse is going to jump in and you can travel to downtown San Francisco

66
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,980
We don't know any company in the world that is driving that multi-dimensional degree of difficulty

67
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,400
from urban to freeway to dense downtown

68
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,780
So that's a that's a bicycle?

69
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,760
That was a cyclist yeah and that’s the car behind us

70
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:29,220
Is something like the speed limit, does that get taken by the cameras seeing the signs

71
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,380
or is that something that has to get entered in as you map the world?

72
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:37,640
If there's a sign that’s been vandalized or it’s missing, or you know, it’s got growth on it

73
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,440
The vehicle wouldn't know what the speed limit is and that could cause an incident right

74
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,980
or a fine

75
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,240
So speed limits are really well understood on the road networks. So we put that in as a primer on the map

76
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:47,740
Ok

77
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,560
So coming up right here we have to do a left turn yield

78
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,000
So you got to see this other car

79
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,220
Yes so were we would be concerned about this car that’s coming towards us from a prediction level

80
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,160
So we just want to make sure that they do the right thing

81
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,700
And now we’re yielding so if you look on this screen see this yellow here

82
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,120
That means we're yielding for that vehicle

83
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,620
Ok

84
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,920
And now we're off

85
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,440
We’re about to drive onto the freeway so this will be interesting

86
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,460
you can see there’s quite a bit of traffic on our left

87
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,740
and the vehicles indicating at the moment

88
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,840
it's going to break a little bit harder because we've got this vehicle right on our 6

89
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,280
and we're running out of runway. And now we merge in.

90
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,040
So that would have been a hard situation even for a human driver.

91
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,360
We needed to merge and that person on the left was not letting us in

92
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,680
We tried to go in front. They stayed with us and then we had to break,

93
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,065
let them go past, and then we pulled in. That was, that was all autonomous

94
00:06:41,065 --> 00:06:42,420
and you could see how smooth that was

95
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,860
Good robot

96
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,720
So one of the hardest things to do with autonomous driving is actually prediction

97
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,880
because you not only need to understand whats the state of the world is,

98
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,140
you have to say well what's the state of the world in the near future

99
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,780
If I do this what will that person do.

100
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,900
And so that creates very quickly a large search tree and if the vehicle is going to drive with good performance

101
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,160
you need to be able to predict well what the state of the world is in the near future

102
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,040
Here’s our new headquarters

103
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:14,680
20 minutes suburban driving, freeways merging, 100 percent autonomous

104
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,260
That was incredible

105
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:16,960
That was amazing

106
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,960
Alright guy, let’s go two for two.

107
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,420
No pressure

108
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,920
Whats’ like in each box it looks like there’s like a Y an L

109
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:35,100
Yeah there's a V an R and an L. So V means vision, R means radar, and L means LIDAR

110
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,000
So we use cameras. We use radar and we use LIDAR

111
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,420
Cameras are really good at seeing what things are

112
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,820
Radar is really good at seeing where things are in terms of how far away they are

113
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,340
And then LIDAR is really good at telling you where things are in 3-D

114
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,080
at pretty high resolution and pretty high accuracy

115
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,120
And so what we do is we fuse those three sensors together in real time

116
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,600
to form one coherent view of the world which is actually what you're looking at on the screen

117
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,480
Definitely crowded

118
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,980
I mean that must make it harder

119
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,520
Oh yeah it's a lot to keep track of

120
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,880
We have made it autonomously to San Francisco

121
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,000
As far as the public knows Zoox along with Waymo, and GM cruise,

122
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,620
are the only companies capable of doing this kind of drive

123
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,960
and this is the first time they’ve ever shown the cars in action to the public

124
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:35,800
Is it madness to take on many of the world's leading automotive and tech companies at the same time?

125
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,880
Yes, Of course it is

126
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:44,960
But I say go fourth Tim and Jessie. We all await our lux robotic ride share of the future

127
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,235
 

128
00:08:50,235 --> 00:00:00,000
