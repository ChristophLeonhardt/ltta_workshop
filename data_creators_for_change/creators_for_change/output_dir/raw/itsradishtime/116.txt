00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
hi guys so I'm usually very careful with

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,609
my things and do not lose them like

3
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:07,890
aside from hats and mittens here and

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,380
there I keep pretty good track my stuff

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,469
but I'm curious about lost things once I

6
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:15,690
went camping circa eight years old in

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,060
the porcupine mountains like Upper

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,369
Peninsula way way up there in Michigan

9
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:23,640
like superior right beautiful<font color="#E5E5E5"> waterfalls</font>

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,890
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remember the most</font>

11
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,000
is my dad getting me this stuffed owl

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,809
toy from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the gift shop called Hootie and</font>

13
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:36,960
from then on every campfire every pike

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,629
everywhere we went Hootie came with me

15
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:42,780
and once I dropped the thing from this

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,270
pile of rocks that I was standing on and

17
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,370
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who d no like a gosh-dang</font>

18
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,520

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,230
holding the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other guy like off of the</font>

20
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,670
ledge of the building and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're like</font>

21
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,370
don't let go I was that serious about my

22
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,379
stuffed owl and<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course as soon as I</font>

23
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,810

24
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,010
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for good and I am in consola ball i</font>

25
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,240
pine for that owl for two years two

26
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,549
years until<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> went camping up there</font>

27
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:19,799

28
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,560
another hoodie it is still in my parents

29
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,080
house somewhere why that all means so

30
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,000
much to me like aside from all the

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,770
reasons that kids get obsessed with

32
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">their toys I think it's because you know</font>

33
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,640
i got it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this like all the worldly</font>

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,710
special place<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got to go to</font>

35
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,590
twice in my life and never again you

36
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,659
lose the thing and you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like maybe</font>

37
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">you could lose all of it like ever</font>

38
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:43,229
having been there because this little

39
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,689
stuffed owl was this thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could</font>

40
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,180
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> get there no place else in the</font>

41
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,579
world by contrast in eighth grade saved

42
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,079
up all my babysitting money and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i bought</font>

43
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,909
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipod mini</font>

44
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:55,560
it was the pink one with the click wheel

45
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,770
and it had solitaire on it and when we

46
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,280
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> on vacation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to Australia I used it</font>

47
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,549
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> avoid my family as humans who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are 14</font>

48
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:09,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">years old tend to do until it slipped</font>

49
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,849
out of my pocket and fell into the sand

50
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:14,459
on Bondi Beach so I didn't even<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

51
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:16,650
go but it was never to be seen again

52
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,810
even though I spent a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of money on it</font>

53
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,150
even though it was super important to me

54
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,299
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprisingly cool about it I was</font>

55
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:26,280
never gonna find it again obviously but

56
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,920
it's just an iPad like every one of you

57
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,569
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> single one of you has like at</font>

58
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:33,510
least four broken ipods in your house

59
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,640
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now right like they're not that</font>

60
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,099
scarce that's why no one freaks out when

61
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,950
you lose a min you<font color="#CCCCCC"> buy another minute</font>

62
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">unless it's a mitten that your favorite</font>

63
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,200
professor in college knitted for you

64
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,959
when you graduated and you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font>

65
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,359
get that back in the comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

66
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:52,859

67
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:55,410

68
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,319
things that you can't replace if you
