OUR ESTEEMED
PRESIDENT, HE WAS IN ARIZONA
LAST NIGHT, I HAD A CHANCE TO
COVER HIM IN ARIZONA WHEN HE WAS
THERE AND I WILL SAY THAT FOR
HAVING COVERED TRUMP AND SANDERS
AND ALL THE OTHER CANDIDATES,
THE PLACES WHERE BOTH TRUMP AND
SANDERS SEEM TO ATTRACT TO ME
THE MOST MEMORABLE CROWDS IN
BOTH THEIR FERVOR AND EXCITEMENT
WAS, CURIOUSLY, ARIZONA.
SO IT
DOESN'T SURPRISE ME THAT THE
NIGHT AFTER GIVING WHAT WAS TO
BE A SOMBER AND IMPORTANT SPEECH
WITH SOME DETAILS BUT MOSTLY
LACKING ANY DETAILS ON
AFGHANISTAN, WHETHER THERE WILL
BE A SURGE OR NOT, THE PRESIDENT
THEN DID A PIVOT BACK TO WHAT WE
CAME TO KNOW AS CAMPAIGNING
DONALD TRUMP, THIS IS HIS
FAVORITE VENUE, HE CAN SAY
WHATEVER HE WANTS TO A CROWD
THAT WILL ACCEPT HIM FOR
WHATEVER HE SAYS, IT WAS NO
DIFFERENT IN PHOENIX LAST NIGHT.
HERE IS YOUR PRESIDENT.
I WOULD LOVE IF THE CAMERAS
COULD SHOW THIS CROWD, BECAUSE
IT IS RATHER INCREDIBLE.
IT IS
INCREDIBLE.
IT IS INCREDIBLE.
AS
EVERYBODY HERE REMEMBERS, THIS
WAS THE SCENE OF MY FIRST RALLY
SPEECH, RIGHT?
THE CROWDS WERE
SO BIG, ALMOST AS BIG AS
TONIGHT, THAT THE PEOPLE SAID
RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING, YOU
KNOW, THERE IS SOMETHING SPECIAL
HAPPENING HERE.
HOW ABOUT ALL WEEK THEY ARE
TALKING ABOUT THE MASSIVE CROWDS
THAT ARE GOING TO BE OUTSIDE.
WHERE ARE THEY?
WELL, IT'S HOT
OUT.
IT IS HOT.
I THINK IT'S TOO
WARM.
THEY SHOW UP IN THE
HELMETS AND THE BLACK MASKS,
THEY'VE GOT CLUBS AND THEN GOT
EVERYTHING -- ANTIFA.
THIS IS THE OFF-THE-CUFF,
FREEWHEELING DONALD TRUMP.
NOMI,
CENK, I WANT TO SHOW YOU BEFORE
WE GET INTO THIS DISCUSSION
ABOUT WE JUST LISTENED TO, HE
WAS TALKING ABOUT THESE CROWDS,
HOW THEY WERE ALMOST BIGGER THAN
WHEN HE WAS FIRST HERE, LET'S
SEE IT, MR.
PRESIDENT.
YEAH.
ALMOST BIGGER.
THAT WAS
THE EMPTY BACK OF THE ARENA
WHERE HE WAS SPEAKING.
I THINK
THIS IS CLEARLY A PLACE WHERE HE
IS MOST COMFORTABLE.
THE NIGHT
BEFORE, LESS THAN 24 HOURS
EARLIER, HE OPENED HIS SPEECH ON
FOREIGN POLICY BY SAYING WE HAVE
TO COME TOGETHER AS ONE, WE ARE
ONE PEOPLE, WE ARE ONE COUNTRY.
IT WAS A SEGUE OUT OF THE
CHARLOTTESVILLE TALKING INTO
TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE NEED
TO DO IN AFGHANISTAN.
A DIFFERENT GUY SHOWED UP THE
NEXT NIGHT.
OF COURSE.
WHEN HE DID THE
AFGHANISTAN SPEECH I KEPT
MOCKING HIM FOR BEING ON THE
PROMPTER, AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE
LIKE REPUBLICANS WITH OBAMA THEY
DISCOVERED A THING CALLED A
TELEPROMPTER, THEY ARE LIKE OH
MY GOD IT TURNS OUT THE
PRESIDENT'S READING -- I KNOW,
THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT A LONG
TIME -- IT'S JUST PARTICULARLY
STARK WITH TRUMP BECAUSE WHEN
HE'S NOT READING IT'S OBVIOUS.
HE WASN'T READING TODAY.
PART OF
WHY THE CROWD LOVED IT SO MUCH,
THERE IS A HUGE DOWNSIDE BECAUSE
THE DOWNSIDE IS YOU GET TO HEAR
WHAT HE ACTUALLY THINKS -- THE
UPSIDE IS THAT IS CROWD LOVES
IT.
THE GUY IS A CLASSIC
CARNIVAL BARKER.
WHEN HE IS
LIKE, ANTIFA -- I FEEL LIKE I'M
IN WWE WRESTLEMANIA 27.
IF YOU ARE OUT THERE, YOU HAVE
BOTH BEEN AROUND THESE TRUMP
PEOPLE, I DON'T BELIEVE THEY
KNOW WHAT ANTIFA IS.
I THINK
THEY JUST WANT TO LISTEN TO THIS
GUY VAMP.
THIS IS INTERESTING, BECAUSE
IF THIS WERE HILLARY PEOPLE, IF
YOU WERE SCREAMING HILLARY
PEOPLE, IT WOULD HELP HIM.
HIS
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT ANTIFA
IS, I THINK HE'S SO UNFAMILIAR
WITH THE ALT-LEFT, THAT POPULIST
LEFT THAT DIDN'T GO TO HIS SIDE,
THAT HE MIGHT BE FUELING THE
FIRE THAT COULD TAKE HIM DOWN
EVENTUALLY.
AND FURTHERMORE IF
THIS IS HIS BASE, IF ARIZONA IS
LIKE HIS LOYAL BASE AND THAT WAS
HIS CROWD IN ARIZONA, I WOULD BE
WORRIED IF I WERE DONALD TRUMP.
BECAUSE THAT WAS A CONVENTION
CENTER, NOT A STADIUM, I'VE
LIVED IN ARIZONA, THAT WAS A NOT
A LARGE PLACE TO GIVE A RALLY.
U.S. PRESIDENTS COME IN MY
LIFE, WHEREVER THEY HAVE GONE
THEY HAVE DRAWN A CROWD.
IT'S NOT UNUSUAL TO SEE A U.S.
PRESIDENT DRAW CROWD ON THE
ROAD, HE JUST TURNS THEM
INTO RALLIES AND CAMPAIGN
SPEECHES.
IT'S KIND OF ENTERTAINING TO
WATCH TRUMP, I WILL GIVE HIM
THAT, THAT'S WHY THE APPRENTICE
RATED WELL FOR A LONG TIME.
IT'S
NORMAL FOR A BIG CROWD TO SHOW
UP AND GET SUPER EXCITED.
AND
LOOK, ANTIFA ISN'T GOING TO
BRING HIM DOWN, ANTIFA IS NOT A
REAL ENOUGH FORCE TO HAVE
POLITICAL CONSEQUENCE, IF YOU
ARE MAD AT ME FOR SAYING THAT,
GOD BLESS, GO FORWARD ON THAT,
BUT NOMI IS RIGHT, THE MORE YOU
MENTION THEM THE MORE THEY WILL
GROW.
SO TRUMP CALLING
THEM OUT, ANTIFA!
IT'S JUST GOING TO HELP THEM.
SOMEONE MEME THAT.
ANTIFA!
HE'S SPEAKING TO THE PEOPLE,
THIS IS KRIS PICKEL SAYING --
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT WAS
THE PRESIDENT SAID TO EVERYBODY,
HEY, POINTING TO THE NEWS,
NOBODY WATCHES TV ANYMORE,
NOBODY WATCHES THESE PEOPLE,
THEY ARE ALL A BUNCH OF LIARS --
MEANWHILE EVERYONE WHO IS
HEARING ABOUT IT IS WATCHING IT
ON TELEVISION, OR WATCHING
IT SOMEHOW.
THE NEWS CONTINUES TO SHOW THIS
PRESIDENT.
HE HAS REWRITTEN A LOT OF THE
RULES, SOMETIMES FOR THE GOOD,
BUT ALMOST NEVER.
HERE IS
ANOTHER REWRITTEN RULE, THAT
USED TO BE A THING LIKE YOU
DON'T WANT YOUR LIE TO BE TOO
BRAZEN OR OBVIOUS, POLITICIANS
LIE ALL THE TIME BUT THEY HAVE
SUBTLE, NUANCED WAYS OF LYING.
TRUMP IS LIKE CNN JUST TURNED
OFF THEIR CAMERAS.
FIRST OF ALL
HOW WOULD HE KNOW THAT?
HE'S IN
THE MIDDLE OF HIS SPEECH.
WHAT A
BIZARRE THING TO MAKE UP.
SECOND
OF ALL, THEY DIDN'T. IT IS
PROVABLE WHETHER THEY TURNED OFF
THE CAMERAS ARE NOT.
HE DOESN'T CARE AS LONG AS HE
GETS GOOD APPLAUSE IN THE CROWD.
SOMETIMES HE IS SPEAKING TO
THE AUDIENCE ON CAMERA, WHICH
STILL -- DO THEY NOT REALIZE
THEY ARE WATCHING CNN?
ARE THEY WATCHING FOX NEWS?
I THINK SO MANY ARE WATCHING
ON FOX, A HANDFUL ARE IN
THE HALL, THEY'LL THINK HE'S
TELLING THE TRUTH.
I WILL GO ONE STEP FURTHER, I
GUARANTEE IF YOU POLLED TRUMP
VIEWERS WHO WERE WATCHING IT ON
CNN, DID CNN TURN OFF THE
CAMERAS?
HALF OF THEM WOULD SAY
YES.
I WAS WATCHING, IT WENT RIGHT
OFF.
THAT WAS THE BLATANT.
THEN
THERE WAS THE SUBTLE LIE, THE
SUBTLE FALSITIES.
LET'S LISTEN
TO THE PRESIDENT TALKING, HE WAS
TRYING TO PROVE TO THIS CROWD
THAT HE HAD EMPATHY FOR WHAT WAS
GOING ON IN CHARLOTTESVILLE WHEN
IT HAPPENED, THAT THE REMARKS HE
GAVE AFTERWARD WERE, BY THIS
FAKE NEWS MEDIA, BY THESE
HORRIBLE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE HALL, THAT THEY WERE
MISCONSTRUED SOMEHOW.
HE WENT TO
CLARIFY THE RECORD.
SO WHAT I DID --
SO WHAT I DID --
I'M REALLY DOING THIS TO SHOW
YOU HOW DAMN DISHONEST THESE
PEOPLE ARE.
SO HERE IS WHAT I SAID,
REALLY FAST, HERE IS WHAT I SAID
ON SATURDAY.
WE ARE CLOSELY
FOLLOWING THE TERRIBLE EVENTS
UNFOLDING IN CHARLOTTESVILLE,
VIRGINIA.
THIS IS ME SPEAKING.
WE CONDEMN IN THE STRONGEST
POSSIBLE TERMS THIS EGREGIOUS
DISPLAY OF HATRED, BIGOTRY, AND
VIOLENCE.
THAT'S ME SPEAKING ON
SATURDAY RIGHT AFTER THE EVENT.
THAT'S NOT A LIE.
NOMI, CENK, THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.
LET'S HEAR WHAT ELSE HE HAD TO
SAY.
WE CONDEMN IN THE STRONGEST
POSSIBLE TERMS THIS EGREGIOUS
DISPLAY OF HATRED, BIGOTRY, AND
VIOLENCE ON MANY SIDES.
ON MANY
SIDES.
IT SEEMS LIKE HE LEFT OUT
A PHRASE WHEN HE WAS
REPEATING IT TO THE CROWD.
JAYAR, YOU THINK THAT WAS AN
ACCIDENT?
I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING
DIFFERENT, WHAT WERE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?
I WAS IN THE CROWD IN
PHOENIX AND SOMETHING SWEPT OVER
US --
YOU ARE WATCHING CNN, THAT'S
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.
THAT IS
WHAT HE DOES, FOR THIS AUDIENCE,
THE ONES SITTING AT HOME
WATCHING FOX, THE ONES IN THAT
HALL, HE CAN GO ON THE AIR AND
SAY THIS IS WHAT I READ, DOESN'T
IT SOUND PERFECT?
THAT WASN'T
WHAT WAS CONTROVERSIAL.
IF HE HAD STOPPED THERE, IT
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN TALKED
ABOUT AS MUCH.
WE HAVE SHOWN POLL AFTER POLL,
EVEN AFTER CHARLOTTESVILLE 67%
OF REPUBLICANS THOUGHT HIS
REACTION WAS FINE.
THAT'S
AMAZING.
OF COURSE A FEATURE HE
PICKS ONE SENTENCE WHERE HE
DENOUNCES NAZIS, PEOPLE GO, THE
FAKE NEWS MEDIA CRITICIZES HIM
EVEN THOUGH HE CRITICIZED NAZIS.
IF YOU TRY TO EXPLAIN THOSE
FOLKS THAT HE ALSO SAID BOTH
SIDES WERE AT FAULT WHEN ONE
SIDE WAS NAZIS AND THE OTHER
SIDE WAS PEOPLE PROTESTING
NAZIS, WHEN ONE SIDE GOT KILLED
IN THE OTHER SIDE DIDN'T, THEY
ARE LIKE, I DON'T DO NUANCE.
ANTIFA!
POLITICALLY CORRECT.
YOU GUYS
ARE SO POLITICALLY CORRECT WITH
YOUR NUMBERS.
DOES THIS WORK,
THOUGH, IN TERMS OF CALLING OUT
HIS STRATEGY?
I THINK IT WORKS
FOR THE SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE
WATCHING US, OR WATCHING
MAINSTREAM MEDIA, WHATEVER YOU
WANT TO CALL IT, BUT DOES IT
WORK FOR THE TRUMP BASE?
HIS NUMBERS AREN'T GOING DOWN.
THEY ARE GOING DOWN, IT'S NOT
INSIGNIFICANT.
AND THEY AREN'T
NECESSARILY GOING DOWN FOR THE
REASONS WE THINK, NOT BECAUSE WE
KEEP REMINDING THEM WHAT A FULL
THIS GUY CAN BE, THEY HAD AN
ENTIRE ELECTION CAMPAIGN TO
LEARN THAT.
THEY ARE GOING DOWN
BECAUSE A LOT OF REPUBLICANS ARE
STARTING TO TURN ON THE
PRESIDENT, AND I THINK ALSO
BECAUSE THE MORE PEOPLE HEAR
THAT IMPORTANT PEOPLE ARE
LEAVING THE RESERVATION, THAT
HAS AN IMPACT.
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT.
AND I
JUST SAW --
WHAT ARE YOU SURE ABOUT?
I SAW A POLL WHERE HIS
NUMBERS WENT BACK UP, THEY HAVE
THEM ALL AWAY AT 44%.
WAS THAT TAKEN AFTER THE
AFGHANISTAN SPEECH?
NO, IT WAS TAKEN THROUGHOUT
THE WEEK.
SOME OF IT DIDN'T EVEN
GET ALL THE CHARLOTTESVILLE
RESPONSE, TO BE FAIR.
I DON'T
THINK THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT
IMPORTANT REPUBLICANS
LEAVING, I THINK THEY KIND OF
HATE IMPORTANT REPUBLICANS.
I THINK THE REPUBLICANS THAT
VOTED FOR HIM RELUCTANTLY, I
THINK THAT MATTERS TO THEM.
AND THERE WERE ENOUGH OF THEM
THAT IT PUT HIM OVER.
IT MIGHT HAVE AN EFFECT ON IF
THERE IS THIS PSYCHOLOGICAL
EFFECT OF SO MANY REPUBLICANS,
LOCKSTEP REPUBLICANS, DISTANCING
THEMSELVES FROM TRUMP AND HE'S
FIRING PEOPLE LEFT AND RIGHT,
IT'S THAT SECURITY WITHIN THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY.
THEY WOULD
RATHER HAVE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
SECURED TO DEFEAT THE DEMOCRATS
AND ANTIFA AND BERTIE SANDERS
THAN KEEP TRUMP.
HERE IS MY SENSE OF IT, HIS
BASE LOVES THIS STUFF, THEY
CONSIDER THIS HONEST AND
ENTERTAINING.
IT'S THE GREAT
RAND PAUL LINE, HE TOLD ME, I
DON'T KNOW WHY HASN'T SAID IT ON
TV, TRUMP HAS THE TRUTH TELLING
WITHOUT THE TRUTH.
HE'S NOT
TALKING LIKE A STANDARD
POLITICIAN, BUT HE GIVES YOU ONE
LIE AFTER ANOTHER.
IT'S ALSO THE AUDIENCE, THE
PEOPLE, CENK.
TO BE FAIR, MOST
POLITICIANS, PRESIDENTS, PEOPLE
WE'VE LOOKED AT THROUGH THE SAME
GLASSES, THEY ALSO TELL THE
TRUTH WITHOUT TELLING THE TRUTH.
THERE ARE LOTS OF OBFUSCATIONS
AND LIES.
THEY LOOK FIXED DOING IT,
MICHAEL, IT'S A GIANT
DIFFERENCE.
I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE WE
HAVE FALLEN FOR IT FOR YEARS.
WE ARE DONE WITH IT.
THIS IS A DIFFERENT AUDIENCE
FALLING FOR IT.
WE ARE NOT DONE
WITH IT BECAUSE LOOK WHO WON.
THEIR IS POLLING OUT SAYING
YOU BELIEVE WHAT DONALD TRUMP
SAYS?
THEY ARE LIKE, NO, AND WE DON'T
CARE BECAUSE HE'S DRAINING
THE SWAMP OR WHATEVER.
I DON'T MEAN WE ARE DONE WITH
LYING, THIS GUY PERFECTED IT IN
A SENSE -- WE ARE DONE WITH THE
FAKE, POLISHED, I DO DECLARE,
THE HONORABLE GENTLEMAN FROM
CONNECTICUT AND NEBRASKA --
PEOPLE HATE THAT.
THE ONLY
REASON TRUMP IS POPULAR IS
BECAUSE HE'S THE OPPOSITE OF
THAT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
CRITICIZING THE SPEECH
VOCIFEROUSLY, WE HAVE OUR OWN
CRITICISM OBVIOUSLY, INCLUDING
THAT HE MAKES STUFF UP, BUT
OVERALL I THOUGHT IT WAS AN
EFFECTIVE SPEECH TO KEEP
HIS BASE.
SPEECHES LIKE THIS ARE HOW HE
WON THE PRESIDENCY.
EVERYONE WHO
SAYS THEY AREN'T EFFECTIVE IS
WRONG BECAUSE HE'S THE
PRESIDENT, AND THIS IS WHAT HE
DID CONSTANTLY DURING THE
ELECTION.
AND I DON'T THINK YOU
ARE RIGHT, I THINK THE TRUMP
PRESIDENCY WILL BE AN ANOMALY,
NOT A NORM.
I THINK HIS SUCCESS
WAS BASED LARGELY ON HIS
CELEBRITY AND THE CULT OF
PERSONALITY AND ONCE HE GOES
AWAY SO TOO WILL ALL OF THAT AND
WE WILL RETURN TO SOMETHING MORE
SIMILAR TO THE I DO DECLARE.
I DISAGREE ON THAT, BUT THAT'S
OKAY.
THAT'S FINE, I DON'T THINK WE
WILL GET AN 
I DO DECLARE.
