BUT FIRST, KRISTIN FISHER HAS
WALTER REED MEDICAL CENTER.
>> IT'S RAINING SO HARD RIGHT
NOW THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP ARRIVED
BY MARINE ONE BUT HE HAD TO
LEAVE BY MOTORCADE BECAUSE IT
SIMPLY WASN'T SAFE TO FLY.
AS FOR THE FIRST LADY, WE ARE
TOLD THAT SHE IS RECOVERING.
WE ARE TOLD THAT SHE'S IN VERY
GOOD SPIRITS AND SHE IS EXPECTED
TO BE IN THE HOSPITAL FOR ABOUT
A WEEK.
WHILE THIS WAS A FAIRLY ROUTINE
PROCEDURE, ANY TIME YOU ARE IN
THE HOSPITAL FOR ABOUT A WEEK
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY PRETTY SERIOUS.
WE ALL FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS AND
WERE SURPRISED BY THE STATEMENT
THAT CAME FROM THE WHITE HOUSE
JUST A FEW HOURS AGO.
IT WANT TO READ IT TO YOU IN
FULL.
"THIS MORNING FIRST LADY
MELANIA TRUMP UNDERWENT A
PROCEDURE TO TREAT A BENIGN
KIDNEY CONDITION.
THE PROCEDURE WAS SUCCESSFUL AND
THERE WERE NO COMPLICATIONS.
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT
CONDITION IS, BUT EMBOLIZATION
IS TYPICALLY USED TO TREAT A
TUMOR AND IN THIS CASE WE
BELIEVE IT'S A BENIGN TUMOR
BASED UPON THE STATEMENT THAT I
JUST READ YOU.
BUT THE WAY IT WORKS, I STILL
GOT A FEW DOCTORS THIS AFTERNOON
AND ESSAY THE WAY IT WORKS IS
YOU PUT A CATHETER IN AN ARTERY
AND YOU INJECT SOME PARTICLES UP
INTO THE BLOOD VESSELS THAT
SURROUND THAT TUMOR, ESSENTIALLY
CUTTING OFF THE BLOOD SUPPLY.
THE WAY IT WAS EXPLAINED TO ME,
IF THERE IS NO BLOOD SUPPLY THAN
THE TUMOR DIES.
THAT'S THE PROCEDURE SHE HAD
TODAY.
AS FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP, HE
ARRIVED HERE A LITTLE OVER AN
HOUR AGO BY MARINE ONE TO VISIT
HIS WIFE.
WE ARE TOLD THAT HE DIDN'T COME
OUT HERE SOONER, HE DIDN'T COME
UNDER THIS MORNING WHEN SHE
ACTUALLY HAD THIS PROCEDURE
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO TIP
OFF THE PRESS.
THE PRESS WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW
HIM ANYWHERE THE PRESIDENT GOES.
THAT'S WHY HE WASN'T A PURE THE
VERY BEGINNING.
THAT'S WHY HE CAME LATER.
IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THIS
WHITE HOUSE WANTED TO KEEP THIS
A SECRET.
THE FIRST LADY OF COURSE IS
KNOWN TO BE A VERY PRIVATE FIRST
LADY, THOUGH IN RECENT WEEKS SHE
HAS REALLY HAD A BIT OF A COMING
OUT.
JUST LAST WEEK WE SAW HER UNVEIL
HER OFFICIAL PLATFORM.
SHE HOSTED OUR FIRST STATE
DINNER.
NOW THIS AND NOW OF COURSE
EVERYONE IS JUST HOPING AND
PRAYING THAT SHE MAKES A FULL
RECOVERY AND IT'S NOTHING MORE
