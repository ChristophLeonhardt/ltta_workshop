I think what is critical and you're
right we are dealing in distinctions
here stuff you're absolutely right
typically we see this president when he
attacks someone go after them by name
attacked them vigorously diggin he
hasn't done that yet and I can tell you
that his top advisor Kellyanne Conway
one of the first people I really spoke
with about this entire issue has been
among the first here at the White House
to say dr. Ford deserves to be heard she
stopped she spoke with reporters just a
few moments ago and she was asked why
the president largely on the whole
frankly up until last night and into
today has refrained from being combative
when it comes to dr. fort take a listen
to what she had to say there's no reason
to attack her the president is defending
his nomination and idea to frame
man of character integrity impeccable
academic the judicial publications and
judicial temperament
same as a stain
and by the way this man's day job is he
has served a dozen years on the second
highest court in the land
respectfully
the president is defending his nominee
but that nominee needs to defend him
are on categorically and unequivocally
allegation says he was not
so that's why we have testimony in our
great democracy will you tie the air out
of them
the president doesn't need anybody to
tell him following your lead you were
the one about first I said at first that
she deserves to be heard and sitting at
home for her not me
and Michigan she should be accommodated
but she is
these conditions I mean I just heard a
whole lawn
you're growing seems the
by the minute I'm glad her attorneys
decided to get off TV and talk to the
Senate Judiciary Committee that's
and prepare her for her testimony but
the truth is the truth
willing to say it yesterday today
tomorrow
next week but any delay beyond that by
Senators who already said they were
going to vote against him
politicizing the process and it's not
fair to judge capital and it's probably
not fair to dock before it's also not
fair to get so little coverage of all
the file language and death threats that
are being thrown at judge Kavanaugh his
family his young daughters his wife
don't deserve that he doesn't deserve
that none of you deserve it so we really
need to tone down the temperature that
way we're not attacking her a lot of
people are tackling him this
thank you and you hurt our colleague
there Jeff Bennett asking some of those
questions staff she was also pressed on
whether the White House would commit to
that Thursday timeline she was
non-committal but again so much of the
focus right now particularly in the wake
of that tweet I just read has been
focused on the president's rhetoric as
it relates to this issue staff hey there
