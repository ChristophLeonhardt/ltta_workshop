ALL RIGHT, OUR NEXT GUEST HAS NOW BEEN CAUGHT UP IN DEMOCRAT'S WITCH-HUNT AND IT HAS COST HIM DEALER AND PERSONALLY, MICHAEL CAPUTO. HE'S HAD TO SELL HIS HOME TO PAY FOR LEGAL FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THE RUSSIA PROBE AND HE'S NOW FEARFUL THAT HIS KIDS' FUTURES ARE IN JEOPARDY OVER THIS. THIS WEEK CAPUTO HAD HARSH WORDS. WHAT AMERICA NEEDS IS AN INVESTIGATION OF THE INVESTIGATORS. I WANT TO KNOW WHO WITH'S SPAYING FOR THIS? I WANT TO KNOW WHO COST US SO MUCH MONEY, WHO CRUSHED OUR KIDS, FORCED US OUT OF OUR HOME ALL BECAUSE YOU LOST AN ELECTION. I WANT TO KNOW BECAUSE, WELL, G-D YOU TO HELL. MICHAEL CAPUTO JOINS US NOW. I KNOW YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE. YOU SAID WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL. I SAID THIS TO RUDY GIULIANI THE OTHER NIGHT. I WATCHED FROM DAY ONE IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. I'M GUESSING I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE. SHE PROBABLY SPENT MORE LEGAL FEES THAN SHE WAS PAID LAST YEAR. AND I THINK THAT'S THE CASE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. EXPLAIN HOW THIS IMPACTS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. WELL, IT ALL STARTED WELL, THANKS FOR HAVING ME. BUT IT ALL STARTED ON MARCH 20TH OF 2017 WHEN THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HAD A PUBLIC HEARING WHERE REPRESENTATIVE JACKIE SPEIER BROUGHT MY AND MY WIFE'S NAME UP IN THE HEARING AND CALLED ME PUTIN'S IMAGE MAKER. THE THREATS TO OUR FAMILY CAME JUST ONE AFTER THE OTHER. DEATH THREAT AFTER DEATH THREAT. ONE GUY CALLED ME AFTER THAT HEARING ON THE PHONE AND SAID, "I KNOW YOU'RE NOT HOME. WE'RE GOING TO BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN WITH YOUR WIFE AND CHILDREN INSIDE." THESE THREATS HAVEN'T STOPPED. I HAD TO LAWYER UP WHEN IT BECAME CLEAR I WAS GOING TO BE PULLED INTO THE CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATIONS. AND SINCE THEN, AFTER A COMMITTEE INTELLIGENCE HEARING IN 2017 AND THEN A SENATE COMMITTEE HEARING ON TUESDAY AND NOW SITTING BEFORE THE MUELLER TEAM ON WEDNESDAY, WE'RE AT ABOUT $125,000. I WANT TO TELL YOU, WE WERE ON OUR WAY OUT OF OUR HOME, SEAN, ON OUR WAY OUT BECAUSE WE COULDN'T HAVE A HOME LIKE WE HAD AND MAKE BUFFALO MONEY. WE HAD TO MOVE TO WASHINGTON TO MAKE WASHINGTON MONEY SO I COULD PAY THE DEBT THAT I HAD THESE $125,000 IS MORE THAN I MAKE IN A YEAR HERE IN EAST AURORA, NEW YORK. WE DON'T MAKE THAT MUCH OUT HERE.
