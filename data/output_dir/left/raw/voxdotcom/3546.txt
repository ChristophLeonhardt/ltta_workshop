1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:03,080
[Joss Fong] Your body is a temple…

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,560
but mine is also an underfunded museum of
natural history.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,180
It shuts down at noon, because I didn’t
get enough sleep from the night before.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,200
It turns out I’m not alone in this.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,080
“This is hard to hear, but no shocker really...”

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,869
“The Center for Disease Control says insufficient
sleep is public health epidemic…”

7
00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:26,550
“More than a third of Americans aren’t
getting enough sleep...”

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,650
The recommended amount of sleep varies by
age, with newborns needing the most, and adults

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,540
needing at least seven hours.

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,630
But, while over 60% of Americans are getting
enough restful sleep, there is a striking

11
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,560
disparity when you look at race.

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,360
Only a little over half of black Americans
reported getting 7 hours or more of sleep.

13
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,140
Sleep is essential to health.

14
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,460
Everyone has to do it.

15
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,719
What does a good night’s sleep look like?

16
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,670
A good night’s sleep is spending at least
85% of the time sleeping in the bed — like

17
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:12,779
on an actual bed, not on the floor, not on the couch,
not underneath someone’s desk, sorry Sam

18
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:17,819
— falling asleep in 30 minutes or under,
waking up only once per night, and if you

19
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:20,539
do wake up it’s for less than 20 minutes.

20
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:24,119
And don’t forget the recommended 7 hours
or more of sleep.

21
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:29,840
Bad sleep is spending less than 74% of sleeping
time in bed, taking more than an hour to fall

22
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,939
asleep, waking up numerous times throughout
the night, and if you do wake up it’s for

23
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,840
41 minutes or more during the night.

24
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,020
Getting too little or bad sleep can have negative
effects.

25
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,659
There is a suspicion that disparities in sleep
are also contributing to disparities

26
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,300
in other areas in health,

27
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,329
like heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and maybe
even early death.

28
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:56,719
All these health risks and conditions disproportionately
affect black Americans, who are five times

29
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,420
more likely to get short sleep.

30
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,420
Researchers point to stress caused by discrimination
as one strong possibility.

31
00:02:04,429 --> 00:02:10,560
Since 2000, over 700 published studies have
established a connection between discrimination

32
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,260
and physical and mental wellness.

33
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,180
In one study, scientists found that the more
discrimination a person felt, the less deep

34
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,740
sleep they experienced.

35
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:24,060
The black participants of this study perceived
more discrimination and slept more in light

36
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:26,319
sleep and less in deep sleep.

37
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,880
Poor sleep quality is also strongly associated
with how much money you make.

38
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,790
Black americans are more likely to live in
poverty compared to white americans.

39
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,180
It's a function of economics.

40
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,569
It shows people who are working shifts probably
won’t get the best sleep compared to folks

41
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:43,510
who have a consistent schedule.

42
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:49,939
[Lauren Hale} Generally, people who have more
opportunities, more control over their lives,

43
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:51,110
are also better sleepers.

44
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:55,620
There’s a connection between neighborhood
quality and sleep quality too.

45
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,409
Poor communities are faced with higher pollution,
elevated noise levels, crime, greater population

46
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:04,249
density, and sometimes limited access to air-conditioning.

47
00:03:04,249 --> 00:03:08,360
Even if black families are middle-income,
they’re more likely to live in poorer neighborhoods,

48
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,879
which means these environmental factors could
still influence their sleep.

49
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,030
All of these things — the environment, the economy,
stress — can compound on existing health

50
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,030
conditions.

51
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,859
A consistent finding is that when we see
sleep disruptions, we also start seeing signs of

52
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:26,689
insulin resistance— which is a precursor
to diabetes.

53
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:31,319
You start to see signs of increased appetite. You
start to see signs that people aren't regulating

54
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,159
their metabolism so well.

55
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:37,540
Long-term stress can lead to chronic elevated
cortisol levels — which suppress the immune

56
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,580
system, increase blood pressure, contribute
to obesity, and more.

57
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,049
Obesity — which affects almost half of all
black adults in the US — contributes to

58
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:48,709
other serious sleep conditions like sleep
apnea.

59
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:51,739
A disorder where breathing is interrupted
during sleep.

60
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:55,290
And sleep apnea increase the risk for stroke
and heart attack.

61
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,340
Bad sleep can even change your DNA.

62
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,819
Every single cell of your body has a clock
that cycles that turns on and off throughout

63
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,520
the day.

64
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,120
All these clocks are producing feedback loops, so when you disrupt the big clock

65
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,290
in your brain,
you're probably going to disrupt these little

66
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,879
clocks throughout your body.

67
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:17,510
Even modest sleep loss can trigger the immune
system's inflammatory response to disease and

68
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,510
injury.

69
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,080
It all becomes a vicious cycle leading to
worsening health conditions.

70
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,740
Having enough good sleep is a big deal.

71
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,330
But just telling people to "get more sleep"
probably isn’t that effective.

72
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:35,940
Fixing the sleep gap means handling it at
both the individual level and policy level.

73
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:41,180
Having accessible and affordable public transportation,
and housing near jobs would help workers spend

74
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,080
less time commuting and more time sleeping.

75
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,030
Employers could use sleep wellness programs
to incentivize workers to catch up on their

76
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,090
Z’s though a government mandate would make
this more widespread.

77
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:56,020
Even some researchers are using community
outreach to guide neighborhoods to better

78
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,020
sleep.

79
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,449
Then there are steps people can take for more
restful sleep.

80
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:04,580
It seems pretty clear that there's a correlation
between bad sleep and poor health outcomes.

81
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,479
It still not know if you give people better
sleep, if those health outcomes will then improve.

82
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:13,360
And this research is still ongoing, so this
is going to be a really key thing to know,

83
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,480
that if we can improve people’s sleep, we
may be able to make them healthier.

84
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,840
And maybe tackling other inequalities in the
US would be more of a reality and less of

85
00:05:22,840 --> 00:00:00,000
a dream.
