1
00:00:11,515 --> 00:00:12,182
>> President Trump: WHEN I

2
00:00:12,182 --> 00:00:14,585
MAKE PROMISES, I KEEP THEM.

3
00:00:14,585 --> 00:00:16,787
I AM ANNOUNCING TODAY THAT THE

4
00:00:16,787 --> 00:00:18,188
UNITED STATES WILL WITHDRAW FROM

5
00:00:18,188 --> 00:00:20,791
THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL.

6
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:22,927
THE FACT IS, THIS IS A HORRIBLE

7
00:00:22,927 --> 00:00:24,795
ONE-SIDED DEAL THAT SHOULD HAVE

8
00:00:24,795 --> 00:00:27,197
NEVER, EVER BEEN MADE.

9
00:00:27,197 --> 00:00:30,100
IT DIDN'T BRING CALM, IT DIDN'T

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,170
BRING PEACE, AND IT NEVER WILL.

11
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,104
IN THE MEANTIME, POWERFUL

12
00:00:34,104 --> 00:00:37,374
SANCTIONS WILL GO INTO FULL

13
00:00:37,374 --> 00:00:38,175
EFFECT.

14
00:00:38,175 --> 00:00:40,010
IF THE REGIME CONTINUES ITS

15
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,179
NUCLEAR ASPIRATIONS, IT WILL

16
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:46,183
HAVE BIGGER PROBLEMS THAN IT HAS

17
00:00:46,183 --> 00:00:47,084
EVER HAD BEFORE.

18
00:00:47,084 --> 00:00:48,218
>> Bret: PRESIDENT TRUMP

19
00:00:48,218 --> 00:00:50,788
PULLING THE U.S. OUT OF THE IRAN

20
00:00:50,788 --> 00:00:52,690
NUCLEAR DEAL, SWIFT REACTION.

21
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,692
EUROPEAN ALLIES RELEASING A

22
00:00:54,692 --> 00:00:55,759
STATEMENT TOGETHER.

23
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:58,362
IT IS WITH REGRET AND CONCERNED

24
00:00:58,362 --> 00:01:00,798
THAT WE TAKE NOTE OF

25
00:01:00,798 --> 00:01:02,266
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DECISION TO

26
00:01:02,266 --> 00:01:02,967
WITHDRAW THE UNITED STATES OF

27
00:01:02,967 --> 00:01:05,169
AMERICA FROM THE JCPOA.

28
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:05,903
TOGETHER WE EMPHASIZE OUR

29
00:01:05,903 --> 00:01:08,405
CONTINUING AGREEMENT >>

30
00:01:08,405 --> 00:01:10,574
AGREEMENT TO THE AGREEMENT,

31
00:01:10,574 --> 00:01:12,509
REMAINING IN PLACE FOR SECURITY.

32
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:16,280
WE WOULD LIKE TO AVOID TAKING

33
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,781
ACTION WHICH OBSTRUCTS

34
00:01:17,781 --> 00:01:19,083
LIMITATIONS TO ALL OTHER PARTIES

35
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:20,017
TO THE DEAL, AND NOT ALL

36
00:01:20,017 --> 00:01:23,754
COUNTRIES SHARING THAT.

37

00:01:25,222 --> 00:01:29,193
KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA FULLY

39
00:01:29,193 --> 00:01:30,561
SUPPORTS THE MEASURES TAKEN BY

40
00:01:30,561 --> 00:01:33,397
THE PRESIDENT OF THE

41
00:01:33,397 --> 00:01:34,565
UNITED STATES WITH JCPOA.

42
00:01:34,565 --> 00:01:36,867
WE'VE ALWAYS HAD CONCERNS IN

43
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:38,802
REGARDS TO THE MISSILE PROGRAM

44
00:01:38,802 --> 00:01:40,571
AND IRAN SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM.

45
00:01:40,571 --> 00:01:42,373
SIMILAR STATEMENTS COMING FROM

46
00:01:42,373 --> 00:01:45,943
THE UAE, BUCK RAIN, THE GOD >>

47
00:01:45,943 --> 00:01:47,911

ACROSS THE BOARD, THE WORLD

54
00:01:59,923 --> 00:02:02,393
REACTION, YOUR TAKE ON THIS AND

55
00:02:02,393 --> 00:02:05,362
THE HOPES THAT PERHAPS, YOU

56
00:02:05,362 --> 00:02:07,598
HEARD THE SECRETARY OF STATE >>

57
00:02:07,598 --> 00:02:09,800
TREASURIES SAY, THERE MAY BE

58
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,168
RENEGOTIATION?

59
00:02:11,168 --> 00:02:14,605
>> THERE IS ALSO THE PERIOD OF

60
00:02:14,605 --> 00:02:16,040
90-180 DAYS, AND THERE ARE NOW

61
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,408
NEGOTIATIONS THAT I GUESS HAVE

62
00:02:17,408 --> 00:02:19,376
BEEN ANNOUNCED BETWEEN IRAN AND

63
00:02:19,376 --> 00:02:20,411
THE EUROPEAN ALLIES.

64
00:02:20,411 --> 00:02:23,714
SO FAR THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY

65
00:02:23,714 --> 00:02:24,615
KIND OF CLEAR STATEMENTS FROM

66
00:02:24,615 --> 00:02:27,017
THE IRANIANS, THOSE TWO THINGS

67
00:02:27,017 --> 00:02:28,752
THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BEGIN

68
00:02:28,752 --> 00:02:30,554
ENRICHING BEYOND THE LIMITS ON

69
00:02:30,554 --> 00:02:33,190
URANIUM AND BUILDING UP THEIR

70
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,791
PROGRAM, OR KICKING OUT

71
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:36,193
INSPECTORS.

72
00:02:36,193 --> 00:02:37,394
ALL OF THAT IS PRETTY GOOD.

73
00:02:37,394 --> 00:02:39,863
I THINK IN SOME WAYS, IT COULD

74
00:02:39,863 --> 00:02:41,598
BE A CONTINUATION OF THE

75
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:42,900
STRATEGY THAT TRUMP HAS PURSUED

76
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,435
REALLY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF

77
00:02:44,435 --> 00:02:46,403
HIS PRESIDENCY, WHICH IS TO TRY

78
00:02:46,403 --> 00:02:48,372
TO RENEGOTIATE A BETTER DEAL.

79
00:02:48,372 --> 00:02:49,273
BUT THERE IS A PARADOX IN WHAT

80
00:02:49,273 --> 00:02:51,742
HE SAID TODAY WHICH IS THAT HE

81
00:02:51,742 --> 00:02:53,043
REALLY MADE A VERY CLEAR

82
00:02:53,043 --> 00:02:54,678
STATEMENT OF SOLIDARITY WITH THE

83
00:02:54,678 --> 00:02:57,781
IRANIAN PEOPLE AND THE QUESTION

84
00:02:57,781 --> 00:02:59,583
IS, IF TRUMP NEGOTIATES A

85
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:00,984
BARGAIN WITH THE IRANIAN REGIME,

86
00:03:00,984 --> 00:03:03,053
WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE THE

87
00:03:03,053 --> 00:03:03,987
IRANIAN PEOPLE?

88
00:03:03,987 --> 00:03:05,789
THAT'S A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO

89
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:07,391
BEGIN THINKING ABOUT WAYS TO

90
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:08,125
SUPPORT THE DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT

91
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:11,028
WHICH HAS BEEN GAINING MOMENTUM

92
00:03:11,028 --> 00:03:14,431
SINCE LATE DECEMBER IN IRAN.

93
00:03:14,431 --> 00:03:16,200
>> Bret: EXACTLY, THOSE

94
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,835
BEGINNING IS ESSENTIALLY ABOUT

95
00:03:17,835 --> 00:03:21,171
THE WEAKENING ECONOMY IN IRAN.

96
00:03:21,171 --> 00:03:26,410
HERE IS IRAN REACTING.

97
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,713
>> [INTERPRETER]

98
00:03:29,713 --> 00:03:30,614
TONIGHT WE WITNESS AND

99
00:03:30,614 --> 00:03:32,182
EXPERIENCE, THE SAME THING THAT

100
00:03:32,182 --> 00:03:34,118
WE HAVE SAID AND REPEATED FOR 40

101
00:03:34,118 --> 00:03:34,651
YEARS HAS HAPPENED.

102
00:03:34,651 --> 00:03:37,488
IRAN IS A COP >> COUNTRY THAT IS

103
00:03:37,488 --> 00:03:38,989
LOYAL TO ITS COMMITMENTS AND THE

104
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:40,824
U.S. AS A COUNTRY THAT NEVER

105
00:03:40,824 --> 00:03:43,794
STICKS TO ITS COMMITMENTS.

106
00:03:43,794 --> 00:03:46,597
>> Bret: MATT, YOUR THOUGHTS

107
00:03:46,597 --> 00:03:47,998
ON THAT?

108
00:03:47,998 --> 00:03:49,800
EVEN IF THE U.S. CAN'T KEEP ITS

109
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,437
INTERNATIONAL DEALS, HOW DOES

110
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,606
U.S. CAN KEEP AGREEMENTS?

111
00:03:55,606 --> 00:03:57,307
>> AND THERE IS OF COURSE NO

112
00:03:57,307 --> 00:03:59,276
FUTURE BETWEEN AN AMERICAN

113
00:03:59,276 --> 00:04:03,981
BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP IN IRAN.

114
00:04:03,981 --> 00:04:06,583
WE HAVE TO LOOK PAST THAT TO THE

115
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:07,384
FUTURE.

116
00:04:07,384 --> 00:04:08,619
IT'S ABOUT THE IRANIAN PEOPLE

117
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:09,953
WHO IN MANY WAYS ARE ALIGNED

118
00:04:09,953 --> 00:04:13,590
LIKE NO OTHER COUNTRY IN THE

119
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,425
REGION TO ACTUALLY BE IN A

120
00:04:15,425 --> 00:04:16,726
POSITION WHERE THEY COULD BE

121
00:04:16,726 --> 00:04:20,430
ALIGNED WITH US ON SEVERAL KEY

122
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,197
ISSUES.

123
00:04:21,197 --> 00:04:22,399
UNFORTUNATELY WE WILL NEVER GET

124
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,100
THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FACT

125
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,202
THAT WE GOT AT THE BEGINNING OF

126
00:04:25,202 --> 00:04:27,204
THIS ARRANGEMENT WITH

127
00:04:27,204 --> 00:04:28,238
PRESIDENT OBAMA, BUT IT DOES

128
00:04:28,238 --> 00:04:33,410
SICK >> KNOCKED THE SECOND BIG

129
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,012
PILLAR OUT OF THE LEGACY.

130
00:04:35,012 --> 00:04:37,681
NOW THERE ARE WAYS IN WHICH IT

131
00:04:37,681 --> 00:04:40,784
CAN BE NEGOTIATED, BUT THE

132
00:04:40,784 --> 00:04:41,251
PREMISE IS DEAD.

133
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:45,989
WHEN YOU HAVE JOHN BOLTON AND

134
00:04:45,989 --> 00:04:48,091
SECRETARY POMPEO IN THERE, GREAT

135
00:04:48,091 --> 00:04:50,994
THINGS CAN HAPPEN.

136
00:04:50,994 --> 00:04:52,196
>> Bret: YOU HAVE SOME

137
00:04:52,196 --> 00:04:53,597
DEMOCRATS OUT THERE SAYING THIS

138
00:04:53,597 --> 00:04:56,767
IS THE WRONG MOVE, THE NEXT STEP

139
00:04:56,767 --> 00:05:00,871
IS NOT SET IN STONE.

140
00:05:01,004 --> 00:05:02,606
OBAMACARE AND REPEAL AND REPLACE

141
00:05:02,606 --> 00:05:04,741
IT, BUT HERE ARE SOME DEMOCRATS

142
00:05:04,741 --> 00:05:08,979
ABOUT THIS DEAL AS IT CAME TO

143
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:09,279
PASS.

144
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,615
>> WE SHOULD NOT GO FORWARD WITH

145
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:12,182
THIS AGREEMENT.

146
00:05:12,182 --> 00:05:13,617
>> THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THE

147
00:05:13,617 --> 00:05:14,785
NEGOTIATION WAS TO ENSURE THAT

148
00:05:14,785 --> 00:05:17,788
THERE WOULD BE NO PATHWAY FOR

149
00:05:17,788 --> 00:05:18,856
IRAN TO ACHIEVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS

150
00:05:18,856 --> 00:05:20,624
CAPABILITY.

151
00:05:20,624 --> 00:05:22,426
AND AT THIS DEAL DOESN'T ACHIEVE

152
00:05:22,426 --> 00:05:22,726
THAT.

153
00:05:22,726 --> 00:05:24,027
>> I'VE SAID MORE TIMES THAN I

154
00:05:24,027 --> 00:05:25,495
CAN COUNT THAT I OPPOSED THE

155
00:05:25,495 --> 00:05:27,664
DEAL WHEN IT WAS ANNOUNCED.

156
00:05:27,664 --> 00:05:29,199
>> OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE ALL SAYING

157
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,401
DIFFERENT THINGS.

158
00:05:31,401 --> 00:05:33,170
NOW WHAT ABOUT THIS MOVEMENT?

159
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,205
>> THIS WAS A FLAWED AGREEMENT

160
00:05:35,205 --> 00:05:36,807
FROM DAY ONE, AND THERE WERE

161
00:05:36,807 --> 00:05:39,409
CRITICS ON BOTH SIDES, THAT'S

162
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:39,877
PERFECTLY CLEAR.

163
00:05:39,877 --> 00:05:42,512
RIGHT NOW, THERE ARE SENIOR

164
00:05:42,512 --> 00:05:44,781
MEMBERS ON CAPITOL HILL, HOUSE

165
00:05:44,781 --> 00:05:47,384
ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE

166
00:05:47,384 --> 00:05:49,186
CHAIRMAN, SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE

167
00:05:49,186 --> 00:05:49,853
FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE,

168
00:05:49,853 --> 00:05:52,689
SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE

169
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:54,191
ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE WHO ARE

170
00:05:54,191 --> 00:05:55,292
REPUBLICANS, VERY WORRIED ABOUT

171
00:05:55,292 --> 00:05:56,426
THE FACT THAT YOU GET OUT OF

172
00:05:56,426 --> 00:05:58,595
THIS DEAL AND YOU ARE LEFT IN A

173
00:05:58,595 --> 00:05:59,062
PERILOUS PLACE.

174
00:05:59,062 --> 00:06:01,632
VERY DIFFICULT, AND IT MAKES THE

175
00:06:01,632 --> 00:06:02,799
CHALLENGE WITH NORTH KOREA MUCH

176
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:03,800
MORE DIFFICULT AND IT CREATES A

177
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,003
WHOLE HOST OF PROBLEMS AND

178
00:06:06,003 --> 00:06:07,371
CONSEQUENCES IN THE YEARS TO

179
00:06:07,371 --> 00:00:00,000
COME.
