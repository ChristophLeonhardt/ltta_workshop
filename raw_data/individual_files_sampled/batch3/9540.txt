Martha: BREAKING TONIGHT, PRESIDENT TRUMP ON OP ED SAID THAT HE TOLD HIS DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN WHAT TO SAY IN A CRUCIAL MEMO THAT PLAYED A ROLE IN THE FIRING OF JAMES COMEY. TELLING FOX NEWS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTED HIM TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT HE WAS NOT UNDER INVESTIGATION IN THE RUSSIA PROBE. BACK TO THAT TODAY TWEETING THAT RUSSIA HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE COMEY FIRING, FIRING ANDREW McCABE, WRITING A MEMO AS IT WAS HAPPENING, AND NOW THAT MEMO WAS IN THE HANDS OF ROBERT MUELLER. HERE NOW JONATHAN TURLEY, WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY LAW PROFESSOR TO REACT TO THAT, JONATHAN, GOOD TO SEE YOU. SO WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE McCABE MEMO THAT HE WROTE AND TURNED OVER? IT IS HARD TO SAY, I THINK THAT ULTIMATELY IT MAY SAY MORE ABOUT THE McCABE'S MIND-SET THAN THE PRESIDENTS. THE PRESIDENT WAS CLEAR, HE TOLD EVERYBODY FROM THE FBI DIRECTOR TO HIS BARBER THAT HE WANTED IT TO BE MADE PUBLIC THAT HE WAS NOT A TARGET OR SUBJECT OF THE INVESTIGATION. HE HAD BEEN VERY CONSISTENT ABOUT THAT. ALL OF THE WITNESSES HAVE SAID THAT. IT IS NOT TOO SURPRISING THAT HE SUGGESTED THE SAME MANTRA. IT MIGHT BE AN OBSESSION TO BE SURE, BUT IT IS NOT A COVER STORY. AT LEAST FOR PEOPLE LOOKING AT IT OBJECTIVELY. IF McCABE WROTE THE MEMO, BECAUSE HE FELT THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS TRYING TO CREATE A COVER STORY, IT DOES RAISE THE QUESTION HOW McCABE VIEWED THE PRESIDENT AND HIS MOTIVATION. SO THE MEMO MAY SAY A LOT ABOUT BOTH MEN. Martha: HERE IS ONE OF THE TWEETS THAT THE PRESIDENT PUT OUT TODAY. "NOT THAT IT MATTERS, BUT I NEVER FIRED JAMES COMEY BECAUSE OF RUSSIA. THE CORRUPT MAINSTREAM MEDIA LOVES TO PUSH THE NARRATIVE, BUT THEY KNOW IT IS NOT TRUE. "WHAT EVERYBODY TOOK OFF WAS A SOUND BITE FROM NBC BACK IN 2017. AND IN FACT WHEN I DECIDED TO JUST DO IT, I SAID TO MYSELF, I SAID, YOU KNOW, THIS RUSSIA THING WITH TRUMP-RUSSIA IS A MADE UP STORY, IT IS AN EXCUSE BY THE DEMOCRATS LOSING AN ELECTION. Martha: JONATHAN TURLEY, THE QUESTION IS, IF THAT WAS IN HIS MIND THAT HE WANTED ROD ROSENSTEIN TO SAY THAT HE WAS NOT UNDER INVESTIGATION, WE KNOW THAT THAT WAS STUCK IN HIS CLAW THAT HE WANTED JAMES COMEY TO SAY THAT AS WELL. IS THERE ANYTHING ILLEGAL ABOUT THAT? OR IS THAT OBSTRUCTION IN ANY WAY IN OF ITSELF? TWO-POINT SHOULD BE MADE, OBVIOUSLY THIS WAS SELF IMMOLATION, I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE PRESIDENT WOULD SAY THAT. BUT IN FAIRNESS TO HIM, HE WENT ON IN THE SAME INTERVIEW AND HE SAID, I UNDERSTAND BY FIRING COMEY, I'M LIKELY TO PROLONG THIS INVESTIGATION. HE ALSO INDICATED THAT HE UNDERSTOOD THE INVESTIGATION HAD TO RUN ITS COURSE. COMEY SAID THAT THE PRESIDENT AGREED WITH HIM THAT THE INVESTIGATION SHOULD RUN ITS COURSE. SO THE RHETORIC IS NOT AS CLEAR AS PEOPLE MAKE IT OUT TO BE. BUT IN TERMS OF OBSTRUCTION, I THINK THAT THERE IS NO CREDIBLE EVIDENCE BASED ON THE COMEY FIRING TO MAKE OUT A CRIMINAL CHARGE. THERE WERE PLENTY OF REASONS FOR TRUMP TO FIRE COMEY. THE ROSENSTEIN LETTER REVEALS WHAT EVERYBODY ALREADY KNOWS, WHICH IS THE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ALIKE, FORMER JUSTICE OFFICIAL FELT THAT HE SHOULD BE FIRED. HE HAD A PERFECTLY VALID REASON TO DO SO. THE STATEMENT OBVIOUSLY IT HAS COST HIM A GREAT DEAL, BUT I DO NOT THINK THAT IT MAKES OUT A CASE FOR OBSTRUCTION. Martha: REALLY ALL DEPENDS IN THE END, WE ARE ALL WAITING FOR THE REPORT FROM ROBERT MUELLER AND HOW HE INTERPRETS IT. BUT ACCORDING TO THE STORIES, THERE IS A BREATHLESS STORY OF US IN THE DAY THAT PUSHES FORWARD THE NARRATIVE INTEREST TO GET INTO THE MIND OF ROBERT MUELLER HOW HE IS INTERPRETING ALL OF THIS. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS, THAT WE DO NOT KNOW HOW HE IS INTERPRETING ALL OF THIS. I THINK THAT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. I CAN TELL YOU THAT FROM A CRIMINAL DEFENSE STANDPOINT, PEOPLE ARE FOOLING THEMSELVES WHEN THEY SAY, BELIEVE THAT THE COMEY FIRING ALONE WOULD BE THE BASIS OF AN OBSTRUCTION CASE. MOREOVER, THE PRESIDENT HAS A GOOD BASIS TO ARGUE, EVEN HIS PROBLEMS WITH JEFF SESSIONS DID NOT AMOUNT TO OBSTRUCTION. I THINK THAT HE IS WRONG ABOUT JEFF SESSIONS. I THINK THAT JEFF SESSIONS TOOK THE RIGHT STEP. I THINK THAT THAT WAS THE ETHICAL COURSE TO TAKE. BUT THE PRESIDENT CAN SAY THAT HE FELT THAT THE FBI WAS HOSTILE TERRITORY. AND THAT'S WHEN HE CAME INTO OFFICE AND FOUND OUT THAT THE FBI WAS INVESTIGATING HIM, HE WANTED TO HAVE ONE OF HIS OWN PEOPLE AT THE TOP OF THAT INVESTIGATION. NOW, THAT DOES NOT MAKE FOR OBSTRUCTION. HE MAY BE BAD JUDGMENT ON HIS
