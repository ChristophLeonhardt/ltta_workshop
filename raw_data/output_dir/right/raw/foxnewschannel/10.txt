IT'S NOT UNUSUAL.

105
00:02:53,115 --> 00:02:53,581

FROM SOME COUNTRIES AND THEY

109
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,822
WILL SAY THAT'S THE WAY MEN ACT.

110
00:03:00,823 --> 00:03:02,390
MEN HATE WOMEN.

111
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:03,391
WHAT?

112
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:04,092
WHERE'S THAT FROM?

113
00:03:04,093 --> 00:03:05,627

114
00:03:05,628 --> 00:03:07,996
IS WHAT THEY MEAN WHEN THEY SAY

115
00:03:07,997 --> 00:03:08,596

116
00:03:08,597 --> 00:03:21,943

117
00:03:21,944 --> 00:03:22,644
>> Dana: I THINK YOU SHOULD GO

118
00:03:22,645 --> 00:03:23,311
SURVEYED THE CLASS, JESSE.

119
00:03:23,312 --> 00:03:23,912
>> Jesse: I HAVE A LONG

120
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:24,412
HISTORY AT BROWN.

121
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:25,046
WHEN I WAS THERE SHOOTING

122
00:03:25,047 --> 00:03:25,747

124
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:26,881
IT'S BECAUSE I'M SO TOXIC.

125
00:03:26,882 --> 00:03:27,382

126
00:03:27,383 --> 00:03:28,116
I'VE BEEN UNDER THE ASSUMPTION

127

THAT WOMEN ARE ATTRACTED TO MEN

128
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:30,418
WHO ARE MANLY.

129
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,519
THEY MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.

130
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,221
THEY WORK WITH THEIR HANDS AND

131
00:03:33,222 --> 00:03:35,023
SWEEP YOU OFF YOUR FEET, THEY

132
00:03:35,024 --> 00:03:36,090
HOLD THE DOOR FOR YOU.

133
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:39,027
TAKE CARE OF YOU AND ACT TOUGH.

134
00:03:39,028 --> 00:03:39,794
DON'T CRY.

135
00:03:39,795 --> 00:03:40,828
NEVER SHOW THEIR FEELINGS.

136
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:43,464
>> Dana: OKAY, YEAH.

137
00:03:43,465 --> 00:03:45,967
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY --

138
00:03:45,968 --> 00:03:46,634
[LAUGHTER]

139
00:03:46,635 --> 00:03:48,169

141
00:03:50,372 --> 00:03:51,039
SPEAK FOR ME.

142
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,508
>> Greg: PAM, THIS FEELS LIKE

143
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:55,877
A REEDUCATION CAMP FOR THE EVIL

144
00:03:55,878 --> 00:03:57,579
MALE TO ME.

145
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,715
>> Pam: AS AT GRAD SCHOOL, CAN

146
00:04:00,716 --> 00:04:04,986
YOU IMAGINE LOOKING AT

147
00:04:04,987 --> 00:04:06,588
TRANSCRIPTS SAYING "UNLEASHING

148
00:04:06,589 --> 00:04:07,222
TOXIC MASCULINITY."

149
00:04:07,223 --> 00:04:08,223
WHAT GRADE DID YOU GET?

150
00:04:08,224 --> 00:04:10,391
IF YOU DIDN'T GET A A, YOU'RE IN

151
00:04:10,392 --> 00:04:11,226
BIG TROUBLE.

152
00:04:11,227 --> 00:04:12,627
THIS NEEDS TO BE LEARNED MUCH

153
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:13,428
YOUNGER IN THE HOME.

154
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:14,762
IF YOU ARE IN COLLEGE AND YOU

155
00:04:14,763 --> 00:04:17,232
STILL HAVE THESE ISSUES.

156
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:18,499
>> Greg: BY THE WAY, THE

157
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,268
ISSUES ARE THEY JUST DON'T LIKE

158
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,203
MEN.

159
00:04:22,204 --> 00:04:23,705
>> Dana: AT BROWN, DON'T YOU

160
00:04:23,706 --> 00:04:25,206
THINK GUYS SIGN UP FOR THIS

161
00:04:25,207 --> 00:04:28,076
CLASS THINKING THEY ARE GOING TO

162
00:04:28,077 --> 00:04:29,210
GET A DATE?

163
00:04:29,211 --> 00:04:30,411
>> Jesse: YES!

164
00:04:30,412 --> 00:04:32,080
>> Dana: THEY MIGHT GET A

165
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:32,380
DATE.

166
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:35,516
>> Greg: DO YOU WANT TO DATE A

167
00:04:35,517 --> 00:04:37,785
WOMAN INTERESTED IN TAKING TOXIC

168
00:04:37,786 --> 00:04:38,186
MASCULINITY.

169
00:04:38,187 --> 00:04:39,387
>> Dana: WOMEN AT BROWN

170
00:04:39,388 --> 00:04:40,655
PROBABLY WANT THEM TO TAKE THAT

171
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:41,823
CLASS AND THEY CAN TALK ABOUT

172
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:42,423
IT.

173
00:04:42,424 --> 00:04:43,992
I DON'T THINK IT WILL LAST.

174
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:46,594
>> Greg: THE NEW THING IS TO

175
00:04:46,595 --> 00:04:47,395
CALL IT TOXIC.

176
00:04:47,396 --> 00:04:49,797
IF YOU SAID THIS ABOUT WOMEN,

182
00:04:56,138 --> 00:04:58,139
I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT.

183
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,807

184
00:04:59,808 --> 00:05:00,174
SYMPTOMS?

185
00:05:00,175 --> 00:00:00,000
