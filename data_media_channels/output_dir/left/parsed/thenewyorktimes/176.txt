President Trump
made news this week
by pardoning a conservative
commentator, Dinesh D’Souza,
and hinting that
he may also pardon
Martha Stewart, 
the lifestyle mogul,
and Rod Blagojevich, 
the former governor of Illinois.
In discussing these cases,
President Trump
often returns to a theme.
He says these people have been
treated unfairly
by prosecutors,
and that resonates with
some of his thinking
about his own case.
Many presidents have
thought themselves confined
by constitutional norms.
But there’s really no
question that the Constitution
gives the president
unlimited authority to pardon
people convicted 
of federal crimes.
Previous presidents have used
much of their pardon authority
on cases of more
ordinary Americans
who have served their entire
sentence, expressed remorse,
and after years
applied for a pardon.
It’s not particularly
unusual for presidents
to pardon prominent people,
including high-profile
associates caught up in
the criminal justice system,
but they typically do
it late in their terms.
That doesn’t mean there are
no responses to pardons
people might find
inappropriate.
Impeachment of course
is a possibility,
or political consequences.
“I feel that Richard Nixon
and his loved ones
have suffered enough.”
When President
Gerald Ford pardoned
President Nixon
after Nixon resigned,
it surely contributed to
President Ford’s inability
to gain election.
President Trump has used 
his pardon authority
really exclusively to focus
on prominent people,
often people closely
aligned with him politically
or caught up in investigations
that he finds unfair
because they mirror
investigations of him
and his associates.
Many of the cases involve
prosecutions brought
by people that
President Trump dislikes,
notably the former director
of the F.B.I. and the former
United States attorney from the
Southern District of New York
in Manhattan, whom
President Trump fired.
To associates entangled
in the Russia investigation,
they might think that
President Trump’s willingness
to issue these pardons
suggests he’s prepared
to pardon them as well.
