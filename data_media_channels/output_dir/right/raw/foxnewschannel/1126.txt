DANA PERINO.

00:00:03,817 --> 00:00:10,624
"THE FIVE" ."

3
00:00:10,624 --> 00:00:12,025
RECENTLY, CNN ASKED, WITH ALL

4
00:00:12,025 --> 00:00:14,161
THE GOOD NEWS, WHY AREN'T PEOPLE

5
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:15,429
SMILING?

6
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:17,564
IT IS LIKE THE LOCAL SKUNK

7
00:00:17,564 --> 00:00:19,633
WONDERING WHY EVERYTHING AROUND

8
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:20,634
HIM STINKS.

9
00:00:20,634 --> 00:00:21,835
CLUELESS RESULTS FROM THE

10
00:00:21,835 --> 00:00:23,203
COMPLETE DENIAL OF HOW

11
00:00:23,203 --> 00:00:24,438
DONALD TRUMP WORKS, FUELED BY

12
00:00:24,438 --> 00:00:26,039
CONFIRMATION BIAS THAT SEEKS

13
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,607
ONLY TO PROVE THEIR NEGATIVE

14
00:00:27,607 --> 00:00:27,908
POINT.

15
00:00:27,908 --> 00:00:29,042
TAKE NORTH KOREA.

16
00:00:29,042 --> 00:00:31,645
MONTHS AGO, IT WAS A NUCLEAR

17
00:00:31,645 --> 00:00:32,846
WAR.

18
00:00:32,846 --> 00:00:34,147
>> TRUMP'S FURY.

19
00:00:34,147 --> 00:00:35,248
>> HE WILL RESPOND TO

20
00:00:35,248 --> 00:00:37,884
NORTH KOREA WITH A FIRE AND

21
00:00:37,884 --> 00:00:39,753
POWER THE WORLD IS NEVER SEEN.

22
00:00:39,753 --> 00:00:42,355
WILL THEY WERE WORDS ESCALATE

23
00:00:42,355 --> 00:00:45,225
INTO AN ACTUAL NUCLEAR WAR?

24
00:00:45,225 --> 00:00:47,027
>> WHAT HE SAYS IF THERE'S GOING

25
00:00:47,027 --> 00:00:49,463
TO BE MORE THREATS, NOT AN

26
00:00:49,463 --> 00:00:50,497
ATTACK, BUT MORE THREATS FROM

27
00:00:50,497 --> 00:00:53,467
NORTH KOREA, WE ARE GOING TO SEE

28
00:00:53,467 --> 00:00:54,901
IN EFFECT A NUCLEAR WAR.

29
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:56,703
>> PRESIDENT OF THE

30
00:00:56,703 --> 00:00:57,404
UNITED STATES TODAY THREATENED

31
00:00:57,404 --> 00:00:59,906
NUCLEAR WAR.

32
00:00:59,906 --> 00:01:01,408
>> Greg: THAT DID NOT AGE

33
00:01:01,408 --> 00:01:02,843
WELL, NOR SHOULD IT.

34
00:01:02,843 --> 00:01:05,412
WE CAN'T LET THE PRESS FORGET

35
00:01:05,412 --> 00:01:05,846
IT.

36
00:01:05,846 --> 00:01:07,614
ESPECIALLY WHEN TRUMP PEGS TO

37
00:01:07,614 --> 00:01:08,248
START MEETING WITH AN

38
00:01:08,248 --> 00:01:10,851
UNPREDICTABLE MAN WITH A STRANGE

39
00:01:10,851 --> 00:01:11,651
HAIRCUT.

40
00:01:11,651 --> 00:01:12,419
ENOUGH ABOUT RODMAN.

41
00:01:12,419 --> 00:01:12,919
ROCKET MAN.

42
00:01:12,919 --> 00:01:15,822
MONTHS AGO, HE WAS DOCTORING

43
00:01:15,822 --> 00:01:16,423
EVIL.

44
00:01:16,423 --> 00:01:18,024
NOW HE IS AT THE TABLE.

45
00:01:18,024 --> 00:01:25,966
REMINDS ME OF A SITCOM FROM THE

46
00:01:25,966 --> 00:01:31,438
'90s.

47
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:34,775
>> SO WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

48
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:37,711
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

49
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:42,215
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

50
00:01:42,215 --> 00:01:43,483
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

51
00:01:43,483 --> 00:01:49,022
SO WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

52
00:01:49,022 --> 00:01:50,423
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

53
00:01:50,423 --> 00:01:52,826
>> Greg: OH, GOD.

54
00:01:52,826 --> 00:01:55,862
BEFORE YOU SAY KIM WINS BY

55
00:01:55,862 --> 00:01:57,364
INCLUSION, ISN'T THAT HOW

56
00:01:57,364 --> 00:01:58,231
DIPLOMACY WORKS?

57
00:01:58,231 --> 00:02:00,433
MEET WITH THE GUIDE, TALK TO

58
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:01,067
HIM.

59
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:01,468
IT'S FUNNY.

60
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:03,837
DIALOGUE USED TO BE THE LEFT'S A

61
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:04,471
BOARD.

62
00:02:04,471 --> 00:02:05,839
WE ARE ALWAYS BEING TOLD WE NEED

63
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:08,041
A NATIONAL CONVERSATION ABOUT

64
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:08,574
STUFF, SO HERE'S AN

65
00:02:08,574 --> 00:02:11,011
INTERNATIONAL CONVERSATION.

66
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:13,547
YET THE SAME WHO CONDEMN TRUMP'S

67
00:02:13,547 --> 00:02:14,314
FIRE AND FURY CHIDE THE

68
00:02:14,314 --> 00:02:14,681
OPPOSITE.

69
00:02:14,681 --> 00:02:17,717
MAYBE IF TRUMP SAYS HE IS

70
00:02:17,717 --> 00:02:21,688
DIALOGUING WITH KIM, CNN CAN

71
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:22,823
AVOID ANOTHER CRYING JAG.

72
00:02:22,823 --> 00:02:24,090
WE HAVE GONE FROM FRETTING OVER

73
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,525
WHERE TO DEBATING THE HOTEL

74
00:02:25,525 --> 00:02:26,026
BILL.

75
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:27,661
HOW CAN THE PRESS MISSED THIS?

76
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:29,863
THEY HATE THE GUY, TRUMP, THAT

77
00:02:29,863 --> 00:02:30,463
IS.

78
00:02:30,463 --> 00:02:32,566
THEY ARE SO MARRIED IS SAFE,

79
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:33,934
PREDICTABLE POLITICIANS WHOSE

80
00:02:33,934 --> 00:02:35,235
MAIN RISK INVOLVES CHOOSING THE

81
00:02:35,235 --> 00:02:36,870
RED TIE FOR THE FUND-RAISER,

82
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,604
TRUMP RUN CIRCLES AROUND THEM

83
00:02:37,604 --> 00:02:40,240
BECAUSE IN HIS WORLD, HE HAS TO.

84
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,041
I'VE SAID IT BEFORE.

85
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,043
KIM MAY BE A DICTATOR BUT TRUMP

86
00:02:43,043 --> 00:02:44,644
IS A DEVELOPER FROM QUEENS.

87
00:02:44,644 --> 00:02:48,014
I AM NOT SURE WHAT IS SCARIER.

88
00:02:48,014 --> 00:02:49,149
ALL RIGHT, I GUESS I SHOULD

89
00:02:49,149 --> 00:02:51,218
BREAK THE NEWS HERE THAT I AM

90
00:02:51,218 --> 00:02:52,419
GOING TO SINGAPORE.

91
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:54,221
ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT?

92
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:55,522
I DON'T HAVE MY CREDENTIALS YET.

93
00:02:55,522 --> 00:02:58,225
>> Dana: HOW ARE YOU GOING TO

94
00:02:58,225 --> 00:02:59,693
DO ON THE PLANE?

95
00:02:59,693 --> 00:03:00,994
>> Greg: I'M GOING TO DO

96
00:03:00,994 --> 00:03:01,461
GREAT.

97
00:03:01,461 --> 00:03:02,262
GORKA IS GOING.

98
00:03:02,262 --> 00:03:03,797
SO IF GORKA IS GOING, I THINK I

99
00:03:03,797 --> 00:03:09,202
SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO, RIGHT?

100
00:03:09,202 --> 00:03:09,569
[LAUGHTER]

101
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:10,737
>> Kimberly: GOD HELP WHOEVER

102
00:03:10,737 --> 00:03:12,839
IS FLYING NEXT TO YOU ON ANY

103
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:14,040
FLIGHT.

104
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,408
>> Greg: WHY SHOULDN'T ONE OF

105
00:03:15,408 --> 00:03:17,244
US BE ABLE TO GO?

106
00:03:17,244 --> 00:03:18,912
>> Brian: "WATTERS' WORLD"

107
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,014
SHOULD DEFINITELY GO.

108
00:03:21,014 --> 00:03:23,416
>> Greg: YOU WITH DIAMOND AND

109
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:26,820
SILK.

110
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,487
>> Kimberly: RODMAN.

111
00:03:27,487 --> 00:03:31,224
>> Juan: LORD HAVE MERCY.

112
00:03:31,224 --> 00:03:33,693
THAT INTRO, IT WAS SO RIDICULOUS

113
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:34,561
THAT INTRO, IT WAS SO RIDICULOU

114
00:03:34,561 --> 00:03:34,961
RIDICULOUS.

115
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:36,229
IT'S LIKE AN '70 SHOW BUT THE

116
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,997
THING IS, THAT'S THE WORLD WE'RE

117
00:03:36,997 --> 00:03:40,133
LIVING IN.

118
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:41,434
DENNIS RODMAN.

119
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:42,636
COME ON, MAN.

120
00:03:42,636 --> 00:03:43,837
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

121
00:03:43,837 --> 00:03:44,571
NOW YOU'RE APPROACHING THE POINT

122
00:03:44,571 --> 00:03:48,275
WHERE YOU SAY THIS ISN'T -- THIS

123
00:03:48,275 --> 00:03:50,443
IS ABSURDITY.

124
00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:51,111
IT'S LIKE SOMETHING SOMEONE

125
00:03:51,111 --> 00:03:52,512
DREAMED UP A PLAY AND YOU SAY NO

126
00:03:52,512 --> 00:03:54,247
ONE IS GOING TO BELIEVE THAT.

127
00:03:54,247 --> 00:03:55,916
JUMPED THE SHARK A LONG TIME

128
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:56,249
AGO.

129
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:58,251
>> Greg: THIS IS SOMETHING

130
00:03:58,251 --> 00:03:59,653
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED BEFORE AND

131
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:01,421
MAYBE THAT'S WHY IT'S HAPPENING.

132
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:02,188
DANA.

133
00:04:02,188 --> 00:04:04,491
THEY TOOK A SALESMAN FROM QUEENS

134
00:04:04,491 --> 00:04:05,091
THEY TOOK A SALESMAN FROM QUEEN

135
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:05,425
QUEENS.

136
00:04:05,425 --> 00:04:07,327
THE PROCESS, YOU LOOK AT IT LIKE

137
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:08,028
A PROCESS.

138
00:04:08,028 --> 00:04:10,063
BUYING A HOUSE OR RENOVATING A

139
00:04:10,063 --> 00:04:10,830
PROPERTY.

140
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,433
COULD YOU SAY THAT'S HOW HE'S

141
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:13,900
LOOKING AT THIS?

142
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,668
>> Dana: MAY BE.

143
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:16,202
BUT I ALSO THINK ONE OF THE

144
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:20,040
REASONS IT'S HAPPENING IS

145
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,474
BECAUSE THE KIM FAMILY,

146
00:04:21,474 --> 00:04:22,642
KIM JONG UN BEING THE ULTIMATE

147
00:04:22,642 --> 00:04:25,045
ONE, THEY GOT THE NUCLEAR WEAPON

148
00:04:25,045 --> 00:04:25,645
ONE, THEY GOT THE NUCLEAR WEAPO

149
00:04:25,645 --> 00:04:25,979
WEAPON.

150
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,047
NOW THEY FEEL LIKE THEY ARE

151
00:04:27,047 --> 00:04:27,380
EQUALS.

152
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,682
THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE AN

153
00:04:28,682 --> 00:04:30,550
ABILITY TO COME TO THE TABLE AND

154
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,853
ACTUALLY NEGOTIATE.

155
00:04:33,853 --> 00:04:34,654
THE STICKING POINT ABOUT

156
00:04:34,654 --> 00:04:35,622
DENUCLEARIZATION, WHAT IS REALLY

157
00:04:35,622 --> 00:04:40,026
MEAN AND HOW DOES IT ALL WORK.

158
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:41,661
I WOULD TEND CAUTIOUSLY

159
00:04:41,661 --> 00:04:42,062
OPTIMISTIC.

160
00:04:42,062 --> 00:04:43,063
NOT NECESSARILY A CYNIC OR

161
00:04:43,063 --> 00:04:43,697
SKEPTIC.

162
00:04:43,697 --> 00:04:44,431
I HOPE IT WORKS.

163
00:04:44,431 --> 00:04:47,334
I ALSO KNOW WE ARE DEALING WITH

164
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:47,901
THE NORTH KOREANS.

165
00:04:47,901 --> 00:04:49,669
>> Juan: I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST

166
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:52,272
DOPES LIKE ME WHO WERE

167
00:04:52,272 --> 00:04:52,639
SKEPTICAL.

168
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,840
>> Greg: EVERYBODY IS.

169
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,842
>> Dana: THE SHOW IS CALLED

170
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:57,844
"WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS."

171
00:04:57,844 --> 00:04:59,846
>> Juan: GREG IS DEFENDING THE

172
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:01,514
PRESIDENT IS A SALESMAN FROM

173
00:05:01,514 --> 00:05:01,848
QUEENS.

174
00:05:01,848 --> 00:05:03,984
HE'S JUST A GUY FROM QUEENS.

175
00:05:03,984 --> 00:05:05,719
THE DEMOCRATS' ARGUMENT WOULD BE

176
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:07,287
WAIT A SECOND.

177
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:09,322
DON'T WE USUALLY HAVE PEOPLE WHO

178
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:11,424
HAVE MASTERED FOREIGN AFFAIRS

179
00:05:11,424 --> 00:05:13,626
AND DIPLOMACY INVOLVED.

180
00:05:13,626 --> 00:05:16,029
THEY DECIDED, BELIEVE ME, THERE

181
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:17,430
WERE PREVIOUS OFFERS FROM THE

182
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,632
KIM FAMILY, THE GRANDFATHER,

183
00:05:19,632 --> 00:05:21,234
FATHER, NOW HIM, FOR MEETINGS

184
00:05:21,234 --> 00:05:22,635
BUT EVERYBODY SAID NO BECAUSE WE

185
00:05:22,635 --> 00:05:24,437
ARE NOT GIVING YOU THAT.

186
00:05:24,437 --> 00:05:26,606
YOU SAID THAT WAS DOPEY AND

187
00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:27,040
OLD-SCHOOL.

188
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,241
>> Greg: YOU KNOW WHAT TRUMP

189
00:05:28,241 --> 00:05:28,641
IS.

190
00:05:28,641 --> 00:05:30,744
HE IS LIKE "THE BLAIR WITCH

191
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:31,444
PROJECT."

192
00:05:31,444 --> 00:05:33,413
AFTER THAT MOVIE CAME OUT, ALL

193
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:34,647
OF THE MOVIES CHANGED.

194
00:05:34,647 --> 00:05:36,316
>> Dana: WITH THE HORRIBLE

195
00:05:36,316 --> 00:05:36,816
CAMERAWORK.

196
00:05:36,816 --> 00:05:39,619
>> Greg: I WAS TERRIFIED.

197
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:41,855
I WANT TO RESPOND TO JUAN'S

198
00:05:41,855 --> 00:05:43,023
MISGUIDED BELIEF WE SHOULD BE

199
00:05:43,023 --> 00:05:44,691
DOING THE SAME THING.

200
00:05:44,691 --> 00:05:46,559
>> Juan: I DIDN'T SAY THE SAME

201
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:46,860
THING.

202
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,062
AS DANA SAID, THE MAN HAS NUKES

203
00:05:49,062 --> 00:05:49,896
NOW.

204
00:05:49,896 --> 00:05:51,664
HE DIDN'T HAVE NUKES BEFORE.

205
00:05:51,664 --> 00:06:04,077
>> Greg: HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

206
00:06:11,484 --> 00:06:12,085
>> Kimberly: HERE IS THE

207
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:12,385
THING.

208
00:06:12,385 --> 00:06:13,053
PEOPLE GET UPSET, THEY THINK

209
00:06:13,053 --> 00:06:13,686
RODMAN IS LIKE A SIDESHOW.

210
00:06:13,686 --> 00:06:14,421
HE'S OBVIOUSLY NOT GOING TO HAVE

211
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:15,121
ANY PLACE IN THE NEGOTIATIONS.

212
00:06:15,121 --> 00:06:15,655
THIS IS GOING TO BE

213
00:06:15,655 --> 00:06:16,189
PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH

214
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:16,589
KIM JONG UN.

215
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:17,223
IF KIM JONG UN FEELS MORE

216
00:06:17,223 --> 00:06:17,957
COMFORTABLE WITH HIS FRIEND FOR

217
00:06:17,957 --> 00:06:18,691
LIFE, DENNIS RODMAN THERE, FINE.

218
00:06:18,691 --> 00:06:19,392
GIVE HIM HIS SECURITY BLANKET.

219
00:06:19,392 --> 00:06:19,993
LET HIM HAVE HIM THERE.

220
00:06:19,993 --> 00:06:20,460
IT WILL BE FINE.

221
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:20,827
WHO CARES?

222
00:06:20,827 --> 00:06:22,295
THAT IS THE BOTTOM LINE.

223
00:06:22,295 --> 00:06:23,263
ULTIMATELY IF THE GOAL GETS

224
00:06:23,263 --> 00:06:24,564
ACHIEVED IN THEIR CALL FOR

225
00:06:24,564 --> 00:06:26,533
SOMETHING AND THEY ARE ABLE TO

226
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:27,200
DENUCLEARIZE, WOULD ANYBODY

227
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,135
REALLY CARE WHETHER DENNIS

228
00:06:29,135 --> 00:06:30,703
RODMAN WAS IN THE COUNTRY AT THE

229
00:06:30,703 --> 00:06:32,038
TIME OR NOT?

230
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:33,440
I HAVE ABOUT THE RESULTS AND

231
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,641
MOVING ON TARGET AND GETTING YOU

232
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:35,141
THE FINISH LINE.

233
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:37,043
IF THAT IS SOME KIND OF PECULIAR

234
00:06:37,043 --> 00:06:39,646
THING THAT MAKES HIM FEEL MORE

235
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:40,880
COMFORTABLE THAT IT ISN'T SOME

236
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,048
KIND OF ASSASSINATION PLOT ON

237
00:06:42,048 --> 00:06:43,783
HIM OR SOMETHING, AND HE'S LIKE

238
00:06:43,783 --> 00:06:45,618
OKAY, I'M GOING TO BE SAFE.

239
00:06:45,618 --> 00:06:47,020
MY BUDDY.

240
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,956
HE'S BEEN THERE SIX TIMES IN

241
00:06:49,956 --> 00:06:52,425
NORTH KOREA.

242
00:06:52,425 --> 00:06:53,726
>> Brian: YOU REMEMBER WHEN

243
00:06:53,726 --> 00:06:55,028
THEY LEFT SENT JAMES TAYLOR TO

244
00:06:55,028 --> 00:06:57,263
EUROPE, THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS

245
00:06:57,263 --> 00:06:58,465
BRILLIANT.

246
00:06:58,465 --> 00:06:59,566
TRUMP SENDS RODMAN AND HE GETS

247
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:00,467
BEAT UP FOR THAT.

248
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:03,236
I DON'T SEE WHAT THE

249
00:07:03,236 --> 00:07:04,437
DIFFERENCES.

250
00:07:04,437 --> 00:07:05,105
KIMBERLY'S POINT IS RIGHT.

251
00:07:05,105 --> 00:07:06,840
HE HAS MET LITTLE ROCKET MAN

252
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,842
MORE THAN ANY OTHER AMERICAN ON

253
00:07:08,842 --> 00:07:11,845
THE FACE OF THE EARTH.

254
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:13,480
THEY HAVE SOME KARAOKE TOGETHER.

255
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,115
THEY HAVE GONE SKIING TOGETHER.

256
00:07:15,115 --> 00:07:15,849
THEY PLAYED PING-PONG,

257
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:16,483
BASKETBALL.

258
00:07:16,483 --> 00:07:18,084
LISTEN TO THE THINGS HE SAID

259
00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:19,085
ABOUT DENNIS RODMAN.

260
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:21,087
HE SAYS HE'S LIKE A LITTLE KID

261
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,088
WHO DOESN'T WANT MORE.

262
00:07:22,088 --> 00:07:23,389
THINGS AMERICANS ARE GOING TO

263
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:25,658
TRY TO TAKE OVER THE COUNTRY SO

264
00:07:25,658 --> 00:07:27,861
HE WANTS HEATH -- HE FEELS LIKE

265
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:28,495
THAT'S HIS ONLY DEFENSE.

266
00:07:28,495 --> 00:07:30,964
HE WANTS TO HAVE WITH CULTURE

267
00:07:30,964 --> 00:07:31,331
IMPROVED.

268
00:07:31,331 --> 00:07:32,232
AND HE LOVES AMERICA.

269
00:07:32,232 --> 00:07:34,434
THEY SAID WHEN HE WENT OVER

270
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:36,436
THERE, HE PLAYED THE SOUNDTRACK

271
00:07:36,436 --> 00:07:37,237
OF "DALLAS."

272
00:07:37,237 --> 00:07:41,040
>> Kimberly: HE IS LIKE GREG.

273
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,376
>> Jesse: FOR FOUR HOURS, HE

274
00:07:43,376 --> 00:07:45,411
PLAYS THOSE THEME SONGS.

275
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:48,815
>> Greg: SO HE IS INSANE.

276
00:07:48,815 --> 00:07:50,416
>> Jesse: TO YOUR POINT ABOUT

277
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,051
REAL ESTATE, HE IS LIKE A

278
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:53,052
MOTIVATED BUYER.

279
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:54,821
HE REALLY WANTS HIS COUNTRIES TO

280
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:56,723
SUCCEED AND HE REALLY WANTS --

281
00:07:56,723 --> 00:08:00,226
HE WANTS MONEY AND TRUMP POINTS

282
00:08:00,226 --> 00:08:01,227
OUT THIS GUY OUT.

283
00:08:01,227 --> 00:08:03,463
HE BRINGS HIM TO THIS FIVE-STAR

284
00:08:03,463 --> 00:08:07,433
LUXURY RESORT OR ITS LEICA $3500

285
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:09,235
TASTING MENU, PEACOCKS ROAMING

286
00:08:09,235 --> 00:08:10,036
AROUND.

287
00:08:10,036 --> 00:08:13,273
THIS EAST MEETS WEST DEAL.

288
00:08:13,273 --> 00:08:14,974
$6,000 PRESIDENTIAL SUITE.

289
00:08:14,974 --> 00:08:15,708
HE IS SAYING CAPITALISM CAN BE

290
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,244
GOOD IF YOU DO THE RIGHT THING.

291
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:20,013
>> Kimberly: AND NOW HE HAS

292
00:08:20,013 --> 00:08:23,283
READ "ART OF THE DEAL."

293
00:08:23,283 --> 00:08:26,052
>> Greg: IT'S AN OLD SALES

294
00:08:26,052 --> 00:08:27,487
TACTIC THAT YOU HAVE THE CLIENT

295
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:29,822
THINKING THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO

296
00:08:29,822 --> 00:08:31,057
LOSE THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE.

297
00:08:31,057 --> 00:08:33,525
SO THEY HAVE GOTTEN THIS FAR.

298
00:08:33,525 --> 00:08:38,131
I HAVE THIS BEFORE.

299
00:08:38,131 --> 00:08:38,765
GIULIANI WAS TALKING ABOUT

300
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:41,833
NORTH KOREA AND HE SAYS HE'S GOT

301
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:42,835
NORTH KOREA ON ITS KNEES.

302
00:08:42,835 --> 00:08:44,637
THESE ARE THE THINGS YOU

303
00:08:44,637 --> 00:08:45,638
SHOULDN'T BE SAYING.

304
00:08:45,638 --> 00:08:47,840
>> Dana: IT'S NOT NECESSARY.

305
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,576
>> Greg: NO, GIULIANI, STOP.

306
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:52,645
>> Dana: SAY IT AT PRIVATE

307
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:54,247
DINNER PARTY, NOT TELEVISION.

308
00:08:54,247 --> 00:08:54,914
>> Greg: HE WANTED TO FEEL

309
00:08:54,914 --> 00:08:58,251
LIKE A WHEN-WIN.

310
00:08:58,251 --> 00:08:59,652
>> Juan: THE REAL PERSON WE

311
00:08:59,652 --> 00:09:01,788
SHOULD TALK ABOUT GOING IS

312
00:09:01,788 --> 00:09:02,322
JOHN BOLTON.

313
00:09:02,322 --> 00:09:07,694
>> Greg: IS HE GOING?

314
00:09:07,694 --> 00:09:10,463
>> Juan: YES.

315
00:09:10,463 --> 00:09:13,967
I THINK HE IS THE ONE THAT

316
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:15,435
SCARES KIM JONG UN, RIGHT?

317
00:09:15,435 --> 00:09:16,869
>> Greg: I AGREE.

318
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:18,438
>> Juan: AS JESSE WAS ALLUDING

319
00:09:18,438 --> 00:09:21,674
TO, SOMEONE CAN TAKE HIM OUT AND

320
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:22,675
WHAT HAPPENS TOMORROW MARK

321
00:09:22,675 --> 00:09:24,577
QADDAFI WHEN WE MADE THE --

322
00:09:24,577 --> 00:09:27,447
>> Greg: IT WAS THE PROBLEM

323
00:09:27,447 --> 00:09:28,781
WHEN BOLTON SAID THAT.

324
00:09:28,781 --> 00:09:29,882
>> Juan: CONTINGENT ON PART OF

325
00:09:29,882 --> 00:09:32,852
THAT IS I THINK BOLTON WAS A BIG

326
00:09:32,852 --> 00:09:34,254
PROPONENT OF THE IRAN DEAL.

327
00:09:34,254 --> 00:09:36,656
IDEALLY IF WE HAD THE BEST

328
00:09:36,656 --> 00:09:37,657
POSSIBLE OUTCOME FROM WHAT

329
00:09:37,657 --> 00:09:39,859
HAPPENS, YOU KNOW WHAT, IT WOULD

330
00:09:39,859 --> 00:09:40,960
BE THE NORTH KOREAN DEAL ALONG

331
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,663
THE LINES OF THE IRAN DEAL WHEN

332
00:09:43,663 --> 00:09:45,365
BOLTON IS AN OPPONENT THERE.

333
00:09:45,365 --> 00:09:46,866
>> Jesse: YOU MEAN WHEN YOU

334
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:47,867
CAN SELF INSPECT YOUR OWN

335
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:49,969
NUCLEAR FACILITIES.

336
00:09:49,969 --> 00:09:52,338
>> Juan: GO ON WITH THAT BOGUS

337
00:09:52,338 --> 00:09:52,705
ARGUMENT.

338
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:55,241
>> Jesse: YOU WANT TO HAVE A

339
00:09:55,241 --> 00:09:58,845
THING -- $6 BILLION IN CASH.

340
00:09:58,845 --> 00:09:59,712
>> Juan: EVEN THE TRUMP

341
00:09:59,712 --> 00:10:01,481
ADMINISTRATION CERTIFIED THE

342
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:02,448
DEAL.

343
00:10:02,448 --> 00:10:04,017
I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE, BY

344
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:07,053
THE WAY, IS WE GO BACK AND SAY

345
00:10:07,053 --> 00:10:08,921
THE KOREAN WAR IS OVER, WE ARE

346
00:10:08,921 --> 00:10:09,489
GOING TO BE FRIENDS.

347
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:11,457
THIS IS THE START OF THE

348
00:10:11,457 --> 00:10:12,558
PROCESS.

349
00:10:12,558 --> 00:10:14,861
I THINK THE PRESIDENT SAID MUCH

350
00:10:14,861 --> 00:10:15,495
THE SAME.

351
00:10:15,495 --> 00:10:18,564
>> Greg: BREAKING NEWS TODAY

352
00:10:18,564 --> 00:10:21,868
ABOUT, IN AP, PRESIDENT OBAMA

353
00:10:21,868 --> 00:10:24,837
FUDGING ABOUT THE IRAN --

354
00:10:24,837 --> 00:10:25,571
>> Jesse: APPARENTLY THE OBAMA

355
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:27,640
ADMINISTRATION LED THE IRANIANS

356
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,574
TO SKIRT THESE FINANCIAL

357
00:10:28,574 --> 00:10:30,510
SANCTIONS TO GIVE THEM ACCESS TO

358
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,177
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF HARD

359
00:10:31,177 --> 00:10:32,679
AMERICAN CURRENCY.

360
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:35,248
NO ONE KNEW THAT.

361
00:10:35,248 --> 00:10:37,350
THEY HAD TO GET A LAWSUIT FROM I

362
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,685
BELIEVE JUDICIAL WATCH TO FIND

363
00:10:38,685 --> 00:10:39,652
THAT OUT.

364
00:10:39,652 --> 00:10:41,654
THEN THE AP REPORTED.

365
00:10:41,654 --> 00:10:43,056
TO THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, TO

366
00:10:43,056 --> 00:10:44,957
MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE IRANIANS,

367
00:10:44,957 --> 00:10:47,460
LARGEST STATE SPONSOR OF TERROR

368
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,761
TO GET CASH BEHIND THE WORLDS

369
00:10:48,761 --> 00:10:53,066
BACK AND THAT'S NOT A SCANDAL?

370
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:56,836
>> Juan: THAT'S NOT A SCANDAL.

371
00:10:56,836 --> 00:10:58,971
YOU KNEW THE WHOLE IDEA WAS TO

372
00:10:58,971 --> 00:11:00,106
GIVE THEM THE MONEY WE HAD

373
00:11:00,106 --> 00:11:00,640
FROZEN.

374
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,909
IT WAS THEIR MONEY IN THE FIRST

375
00:11:02,909 --> 00:11:05,978
PLACE.

376
00:11:05,978 --> 00:11:07,046
SECONDLY, TRY TO REINTEGRATE

377
00:11:07,046 --> 00:11:08,748
THEM INTO THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC

378
00:11:08,748 --> 00:11:09,449
STRUCTURE.

379
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:11,050
>> Jesse: WHY DID THEY HIDE

380
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:11,651
IT?

381
00:11:11,651 --> 00:11:13,786
>> Juan: JUST YOUR REACTION.

382
00:11:13,786 --> 00:11:14,487
>> Jesse: BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T

383
00:11:14,487 --> 00:11:16,356
WANT ME TO REACT LIKE THAT?

384
00:11:16,356 --> 00:11:17,857
>> Juan: THEY DON'T WANT

385
00:11:17,857 --> 00:11:21,627
PEOPLE TO GO HYPERBOLIC.

386
00:11:21,627 --> 00:11:23,563
>> Kimberly: DAY NOW.

387
00:11:23,563 --> 00:11:25,198
>> Dana: IT'S NOT ONLY THE

388
00:11:25,198 --> 00:11:27,066
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ACTUALLY

389
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:28,101
WENT TO A COUPLE AMERICAN BANKS

390
00:11:28,101 --> 00:11:31,270
AND TRIED TO ASK HIM TO DO THIS,

391
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,705
IT'S NOT MONEY-LAUNDERING BUT IT

392
00:11:32,705 --> 00:11:34,474
KIND OF FEELS LIKE THAT WHICH IS

393
00:11:34,474 --> 00:11:35,942
BASICALLY MAKE THIS MONEY RIGHT

394
00:11:35,942 --> 00:11:37,677
IN THE BANKS REFUSED.

395
00:11:37,677 --> 00:11:40,446
>> Jesse: YOU ARE SAYING

396
00:11:40,446 --> 00:11:41,514
BANKERS HAVE HIGHER ETHICAL

397
00:11:41,514 --> 00:11:43,249
STANDARDS THAN THE OBAMA

398
00:11:43,249 --> 00:11:44,083
ADMINISTRATION?

399
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,485
>> Dana: IT WAS ABOUT CONCERN

400
00:11:45,485 --> 00:11:46,219
THEY WOULD BE PENALIZED BECAUSE

401
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:49,455
OF IT.

402
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:50,256
>> Greg: KIMBERLY.

403
00:11:50,256 --> 00:11:51,057
LAST WORD.

404
00:11:51,057 --> 00:11:52,091
HOW DO YOU THINK THE MEDIA IS

405
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:54,460
GOING TO COVER IT.

406
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,094
>> Kimberly: SENSATIONAL.

407
00:11:55,094 --> 00:11:55,795
THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO MAKE

408
00:11:55,795 --> 00:11:58,865
SOME JOKES ABOUT IT LIKE DENNIS

409
00:11:58,865 --> 00:11:59,665
RODMAN, LIKE THEY HAVE.

410
00:11:59,665 --> 00:12:01,868
I THINK THE OUTCOME IS GOING TO

411
00:12:01,868 --> 00:12:03,636
SPEAK FOR ITSELF IN TERMS OF

412
00:12:03,636 --> 00:12:04,370
BEING RESULT ORIENTED, HE'S

413
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,706
GOING TO DO WHAT HE DOES IS ABLE

414
00:12:06,706 --> 00:12:08,241
TO WORK A DEAL.

415
00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:09,675
HE'S ABLE TO GO AND MEET WITH

416
00:12:09,675 --> 00:12:10,443
KIM JONG UN WHEN NO ONE ELSE WAS

417
00:12:10,443 --> 00:12:12,879
ABLE TO GET HIM TO THE TABLE.

418
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,947
>> Greg: YOU KNOW WHAT I FOUND

419
00:12:14,947 --> 00:12:16,449
IN THE GREEN ROOM?

420
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:17,016
I FOUND THIS BOOK.

421
00:12:17,016 --> 00:12:21,788
IT'S NEWT GINGRICH'S BOOK.

422
00:12:21,788 --> 00:12:22,889
TO STEVE DOOCY, A GREAT GUY WHO

423
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:23,923
HAS BEEN A FRIEND IN THE

424
00:12:23,923 --> 00:12:24,657
MORNING.

425
00:12:24,657 --> 00:00:00,000
STEVE LEFT IT IN THERE.
