WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT SAYING ABOUT THIS MATTER SO FAR TODAY? THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WONDERING WHETHER OR NOT THE PRESIDENT WOULD REACH OUT TO KING SALMAN ON THIS VERY TOPIC GIVEN THE KING ORDERED THE INTERNAL INVESTIGATION INTO KHASHOGGI'S DISAPPEARANCE. ON TWITTER THE PRESIDENT IS TALKING ABOUT THAT THIS MORNING. LET ME TAKE YOU THERE AND SHARE WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. JUST SPOKE TO THE KING OF SAUDI ARABIA WHO DENIES ANY KNOWLEDGE OF WHATEVER MAY HAVE HAPPENED TO OUR SAUDI ARABIAIAN CITIZEN. HE SAYS THEY'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH TURKEY TO FIND ANSWERS. I'M SENDING OUR SECRETARY OF STATE TO MEET WITH THE KING. INTERESTING DEVELOPMENT INDEED. THAT INVESTIGATION THAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT INTO THE DISAPPEARANCE IS BEING LED BY THE KINGDOM'S COP PROSECUTOR AS A RESULT OF THE NOT SO SUBTLE MESSAGE FROM WASHINGTON THAT THE SAUDIS NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING. WHEN HE WAS ASKED LAST NIGHT IF HE THOUGHT THE SAUDIS WERE BEHIND THE JOURNALISTS DISAPPEARANCE THE PRESIDENT ON 60 MINUTES SAID THIS. President Trump: NOBODY KNOWS YET. WE'LL PROBABLY BE ABLE TO FIND OUT. IT IS BEING INVESTIGATED AND LOOKED AT VERY, VERY STRONGLY. WE WOULD BE VERY UPSET AND ANGRY IF THAT WERE THE CASE. THERE IS A LOT AT STAKE. MAYBE ESPECIALLY SO BECAUSE THIS MAN WAS A REPORTER. WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT AND THERE WILL BE SEVERE PUNISHMENT. SEVERE PUNISHMENT AS IN POSSIBLE SANCTIONS. I THINK IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT, BILL, TO LET THE FOLKS AT HOME KNOW THE SAUDIS AREN'T GOING TO TAKE SANCTIONS LIKELY SAYING THEY WOULD HIT US WITH OIL PRICES THAT WOULD TOP $200 A BARREL IF THEY'RE HIT WITH SANCTIONS. A BACK AND FORTH FROM WASHINGTON AND RIYADH ALREADY. Bill: NOW THE OTHER BIG STORY IS WHAT WAS LEFT UNSAID I THINK YOU COULD ARGUE FROM THE 60 MINUTES INTERVIEW LAST NIGHT. THE FATE OF JAMES MATTIS. IS HE STAYING OR ON HIS WAY OUT SOMEDAY SOON? OH, IF I KNEW I WOULD MAKE SOME MONEY ON IT. I SPOKE WITH A SENIOR WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL AN HOUR AGO AND SHE SAID EVERYBODY LEAVES AT SOME POINT, EVERYBODY. EVEN ME AT SOME POINT I'LL BE OUT OF HERE. NOW THAT IS NOT TO SAY, BILL, THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS ON MATTIS WERE MEANT TO TELL GRAFSH HIS DEPARTURE OR THE WAY THE PRESIDENT DESCRIBED THE GENERAL SENT THE SPECULATION ENGINE INTO OVERDRIVE. President Trump: IT COULD BE THAT HE IS. I THINK HE IS SORT OF A DEMOCRAT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH BUT GENERAL MATTIS IS A GOOD GUY. WE GET ALONG VERY WELL. HE MAY LEAVE. AT SOME POINT EVERYBODY LEAVES. EVERYBODY. PEOPLE LEAVE. THAT'S WASHINGTON WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
