Tucker: WELL, GOOD EVENING. WELCOME TO TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THAT ABC CANCELLED ITS MOST POPULAR SCRIPTED SHOW YESTERDAY AFTER A LEAD ACTOR SENT OUT A SERIES OF BIZARRE TWEETS WHICH SHE LATER BLAMED ON SLEEPING PILLS. YOU'VE READ ABOUT IT BUT THERE IS AT LEAST ONE UPSIDE TO THE ROSEANNE STORY. THE LEFT IS ON THE RECORD OPPOSING RACISM. ATTACKING PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF THEIR RACE, THEY ARE TELLING US, AND OF COURSE THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ABOUT THAT. LET'S HOPE THIS CONVERSATION CONTINUES AND PROGRESSES. LIBERALS MAY FINALLY CONCEDE THAT DISCRIMINATION BASED ON SKIN COLOR REALLY IS WRONG WHETHER IT'S IN HIRING OR PROMOTIONS OR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING OR SCHOOL ADMISSION. THEY ADMIT THAT, THAT WOULD BE REAL PROGRESS. IT'S NOT HAPPENING YET THOUGH. FOR NOW AMERICAN LIBERALS ARE STILL LIVING IN THAT STRANGE IRONY-FREE WORLD WHERE IT'S POSSIBLE TO DENOUNCE RACISM EVEN AS YOU COMMIT IT. THAT'S THE SAME WORLD AL GORE OCCUPIES WHEN HE FLIES PRIVATE SUCCESS JETS TO GLOBAL WARMING CONFERENCES. IT'S THE PLACE WHERE ATTORNEYS GENERAL CAN YELL AT YOU ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE EVEN AS THEY BEAT UP THEIR GIRLFRIEND. IT'S HYPOCRISY LAND. IT'S WHERE LIBERALS LIVE. LAST NIGHT, FOR EXAMPLE, MSNBC HELD A TOWN HALL MEETING DEDICATED TO FIGHTING RACISM. GUESS WHO THEY INVITED TO LECTURE AMERICA ON THE TOPIC? YOU GUESSED IT, RACISTS. THE SPECIAL WAS LITERALLY CO-HOSTED BY AL SHARPTON, REMEMBER HIM? HE IS THE GUY WHO RIDICULED JEWS IN NEW YORK AS, QUOTE. DIAMOND DEALERS. HE IS THE ONE WHO DENOUNCED A JEWISH STORE OWNER AS A WHITE INTERLOPER. THAT INSTA THAT INSTIGATED A RACIAL MASSACRE IN WHICH 8 PEOPLE WERE MURDERED. ALSO ON STAGE LAST NIGHT WAS A GUY CALLED TIM WISE. WISE DESCRIBES HIMSELF AS PROFESSIONAL ANTIRACISM ACTIVISTS WHICH OUGHT TO BE A TIPOFF THAT HE HIMSELF IS A RACIST, WHICH OBVIOUSLY HE IS. HERE IS WISE USING MSNBC'S PLATFORM TO MAKE UGLY GENERALIZATIONS BASED ON SKIN COLOR. WHITE AMERICA HAS BEEN RAISED TO BELIEF A, THE POLICE IS ALWAYS THE GOOD GUYS AND FRANKLY THAT BLACK LIVES MATTER LESS THAN WHITE COMFORT. WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS MY DISCOMFORT WITH YOU RIGHT NOW IS WORTH MORE THAN THE POTENTIAL THAT YOUR LIFE COULD BE SNUFFED IN 10 MINUTES. Tucker: ISN'T THAT SLANDER AGAINST AN ENTIRE RACIAL CATEGORY? OH, YES, IT IS. BUT LET'S SAY YOU WANT EVEN MORE NASTY RACIAL STEREOTYPING. MSNBC IS THE CHANNEL FOR YOU. THEY'VE GOT IT HERE IS TIM WISE AGAIN. KEEP IN MIND, THIS IS WHAT LIBERALS ARE NOW CLAIMING IS THE OPPOSITE OF RACISM. THE GENTRIFIERS OF TODAY. THEIR PARENTS OR GRANDPARENTS RAN AWAY FROM THE CITY TO GET AWAY FROM BLACK AND BROWN FOLK. AND NOW THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR GRANDCHILDREN ARE SAYING, OH, THE SUBURBS, THERE IS SO MANY OLIVE GARDENS I CAN GO TO. I NEED TO GO BACK TO THE CITY AND GET MY LIFE IN THE CITY. WHEN I DO THAT I NEED TO HAVE MY HOT YOGA STUDIO AND BY PORTER STUDIO AND MY STUFF REPRESENTED. IF YOU INTRUDE ON THAT, I WILL THEN CALL THE POLICE. Tucker: ARE YOU TAKING NOTES ON THIS? ARE YOU GETTING THIS? THEY ARE TELLING YOU ON MSNBC THAT BECAUSE CERTAIN PEOPLE HAVE THE SAME SKIN COLOR THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME DUMB ATTITUDES. THEY LIKE THE SAME CRAPPY RESTAURANT. THEY SPEND THEIR FREE TIME PURSUING THE SAME FRIVOLOUS WHO AREYS. THEY ARE BY THE WAY EVERY ONE OF THEM IMMORAL. CAN YOU TELL BY THE WAY THEY LOOK. THAT'S THE OFFICIAL POSITION OF THE PERSONAL LEFT, THE SAME PEOPLE CURRENTLY ACCUSING YOU OF RACISM. HUH? CHRISTOPHER HARRIS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF UNHYPHENATED AMERICA AND HE JOINS US TONIGHT. MR. HARRIS, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT, WATCHING THAT? TUCKER, THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW THAT CAME TO MY MIND, FOR EXAMPLE, WHAT'S HAPPENING IN VENEZUELA. WHEN TIM WAS TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE TRYING TO GENTRIFY AREAS. WELL, IF YOU LOOK IN VENEZUELA RIGHT NOW, THERE ARE PEOPLE FLEEING A TERRIBLE GEOPOLITICAL SOCIOECONOMIC ISSUE. AND THEY ARE GOING TO TRINIDAD. Tucker: RIGHT. THEY HAVE INFLUX IN TRINIDAD OF VENEZUELANS. AND TRINIDAD IS TRYING TO IMPLEMENT RULES TO KIND OF PUSH SOME OF THEM OUT. NOW, MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THERE IS A LOT OF BLACK PEOPLE IN VENEZUELA. THEY DON'T ALL LOOK LIKE HUGO CHAVEZ. IN FACT, SOUTH AMERICA HAS ONE OF THE LARGEST PERCENTAGES, OVER 50% OF THE SLAVES TAKEN FROM AFRICA WERE BROUGHT TO SOUTH AMERICA TO PLACES LIKE BRAZIL AND VENEZUELA AND PLACES LIKE THAT. HERE IT IS YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE BLACK WHO DON'T WANT OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE BLACK FLOODING INTO THEIR COUNTRY. Tucker: MAYBE IT'S MORE AN ECONOMIC ISSUE AND I THINK, BY THE WAY, THERE ARE FAIR QUESTIONS TO RAISE ABOUT RADICAL DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE FOR SURE. IT UPSETS PEOPLE. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT, TO PRETEND THAT IT'S ALL ABOUT RACE AND THAT ONE RACE IS WORSE THAN ANOTHER RACE, ISN'T THAT THE DEFINITION OF RACISM? ABSOLUTELY. TIM WISE IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO PAY HIS RENT THIS MONTH BECAUSE HE IS A RACIAL PIMP. THAT'S WHAT HE IS THAT'S WHAT HE DOES. HE TRAVELS AROUND THE COUNTRY GOING TO COLLEGES, TELLING YOUNG WHITE MEN AND YOUNG WHITE WOMAN THAT YOU ARE A RACIST AND THAT YOU ARE A BENEFIT OF WHITE PRIVILEGE AND THEY GO ON AND THEY TELL THEIR PARENTS HOW TERRIBLE THEY ARE BECAUSE A GUY NAMED TIM WISE CAME TO MY COLLEGE AND TOLD ME I HAVE WHITE PRIVILEGE. AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT TIM IS DOING, HE IS ASSUMING A PRIVILEGE THAT, QUITE FRANKLY, I DON'T ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE HAS. I HAVE ZERO SENSE OF INFERIORITY. THAT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT SOMEONE LIKE TIM WANTS ME TO BELIEVE. IN FACT,. Tucker: YOU THINK HE WANTS YOU TO HAVE A SENSE OF INFERIORITY? ABSOLUTELY. PRESIDENT BUSH TALKED ABOUT IT HE SAID IT'S THE SOFT BIGOTRY OF LOW EXPECTATION. Tucker: YEAH. THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING AROUND THE WORLD AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN AMERICA. THEY ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO TELL YOUNG BLACK MEN AND YOUNG BLACK WOMEN HAVE YOU NO CHANCE IN AMERICA BECAUSE OF YOUR PIGMENTATION. NO ONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS. ALL BLACK PEOPLE ARE NOT AFRICAN-AMERICANS. MY WIFE IS ACTUALLY HER PARENTS ARE FROM PANAMA. HER PARENTS CAME HERE LEGALLY WITH NOTHING. THEY WERE ABLE TO CLIMB THE SOCIOECONOMIC LADDER. BOTH OF THEM OBTAINED THEIR DEGREES. BOTH THEIR DAUGHTERS OBTAINED THEIR DEGREES. YET, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE, I GUESS SOME WOULD CALL ME AN AMERICAN. I DON'T ANSWER TO THAT TERM. I'M AN AMERICAN BLACK PERSON. OBVIOUSLY CAN YOU TELL BY MY PIGMENTATION I'M BLACK. BUT THERE IS LOTS OF PEOPLE EVEN IN MY EXTENDED FAMILY WHO HAVE NOT ATTAINED WHAT SOME OF MY IN-LAWS HAVE OBTAINED REGARDLESS OF THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN. BUT TIM WISE WOULD YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN YOU CAN'T BE SUCCESSFUL IN AMERICA. AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT? PRESIDENT TRUMP, GOD BLESS HIM, WHAT HE IS DOING WITH THE ECONOMY RIGHT NOW, IT'S HELPING BLACK PEOPLE. Tucker: WHERE DO YOU THINK A COUNTRY WINDS UP WHERE THE OFFICIAL POSITION IS THAT THE RACES ARE DIFFERENT, SOME ARE MORE MORAL THAN OTHERS. AND BASICALLY, THEY SHOULD HATE EACH OTHER? THAT IS THE MESSAGE THAT A LOT OF OUR ELITES ARE FOIS TING ON THE REST OF US. THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY BY TEARING PEOPLE APART. UNHYPHENATED AMERICA WHAT IS UNHYPHENATED AMERICA? IT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE. IF YOU BELIEVE IF YOU EMBRACE IF YOU PROMOTE THE PRINCIPLES OF LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. THEN YOU ARE AN AMERICAN. AND THERE IS NO NEED FOR ANY PREFIX OR SUFFIX. YOU ARE JUST AN AMERICAN. THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO BE PREACHED AND TAUGHT ON OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES INSTEAD OF HAVING THE TIM WISES AND AL SHARPTONS. Tucker: WHEN I WAS A KID. I'M 49. NOT THAT OLD.
