publicly traded company for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> while</font>

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,480
after reverse merger when we did a

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,810
reverse merger in late August 2007 so

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,690
some startups I these reverse mergers is

10
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,330
a great way to get exits would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you ever</font>

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,129
recommend a reverse merger to a start-up

12
00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:38,220
or i would i would have to say to

13
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,980
whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> startup is evaluating do you</font>

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,320
have the operational maturity do you

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,899
know your plan over the next 18 to 24

16
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,760
months and you have enough cash<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,180
bank there's obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> incremental cast</font>

18
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,890
costs that are associated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with operating</font>

19
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,770
as a public company<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a lot of the</font>

20
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,130
times smaller private companies find

21
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,280
that spending cash in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way is not</font>

22
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,930
necessarily the most efficient<font color="#CCCCCC"> use of</font>

23
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,790
proceeds was there ever a moment when

24
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,290
you were just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like wow I wish we hadn't</font>

25
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">done this and what was that moment yeah</font>

26
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean I think pretty early on keep in</font>

27
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,040
mind when we went public via the reverse

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,619
merge in the middle of 2007 the capital

29
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,420
markets looked a lot different than they

30
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,970
did just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> few months</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later and when the</font>

31
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,710
when the capital markets turned on their

32
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,479
head we<font color="#CCCCCC"> looked back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and said you know</font>

33
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,710
what we probably shouldn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

34
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">this so you survived it you're on the</font>

35
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,909
Nasdaq now you had a nice quarter what

36
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:31,860
was the trick<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean what it was a it</font>

37
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,540
was a tough trial how did you get there

38
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,260
yeah just focus on execution you know

39
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,640
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> value in this industry isn't isn't</font>

40
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,729
delivered via proprietary relationships

41
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,710
I can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can work with the</font>

42
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,240
same publishers as one of my competitors

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,549
I can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> buy the same data as</font>

44
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,320
any one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my competitors it's about</font>

45
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">what do you actually do with that how do</font>

46
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,590
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> execute and how do you deliver value</font>

47
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,240
for the client what's the sneaky

48
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,220
advantage of being public because you

49
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,930
know for you know you went for all this

50
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,360
what's the good aspect of it yeah well I

51
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,259
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's increased visibility</font>

52
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,899
obviously we're on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very strong growth</font>

53
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,489
trajectory and now<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are going to</font>

54
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:11,640

traded company we were in that half

56
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:16,560
pregnant state now being on<font color="#E5E5E5"> NASDAQ it's</font>

57
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,819
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a sign of validate</font>

58
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:20,829
that what we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing is going to be</font>

59
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:22,390
sustainable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you are going to see</font>

60
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,239
significant growth from us into q4 and
