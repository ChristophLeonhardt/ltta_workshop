1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,740
Ooh!

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,900
Did you hear that feeding buzz?

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,200
That was fantastic.

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,019
Do you see them?

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,019
Wow!

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,180
Danielle Gustafson is something of a citizen scientist

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,970
Not a scientist per se, but someone who voluntarily
collects data, that’s necessary for the study

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,580
and conservation of species

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,500
She also leads people on walks

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,500
in New York’s Central Park

11
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:31,019
to observe and understand the only flying
mammal in the world:

12
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,019
Bats.

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,820
Did you also just know it was going to be bats?

14
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,020
That was going to be your thing?

15
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,320
Of course not.

16
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,100
Of course not.

17
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,240
Who picks bats?

18
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,620
You did.

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,160
Or maybe bats picked me.

20
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,580
Bats suffer from incredibly bad PR.

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,400
There are a lot of Dracula connotations

22
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,940
And vampire bat connotations

23
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,600
Well Batman seems like it actually does a few good
things for the bats,

24
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,960
except when they’re actually on screen.

25
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,950
Pretty much anything you wanna know about
bats and New York

26
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,860
it hasn’t been studied

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,720
Poor bats.

28
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,960
They’re so poorly studied.

29
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,300
The citizen scientist movement around bats
and other creatures

30
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,200
Is being lifted by a small audio technology company

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,460
called Wildlife Acoustics

32
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,080
We listen to birds, we listen to frogs

33
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,560
We listen to bats, we listen to whales

34
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,560
Our customers are on the front lines watching

35
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,659
major shifts with warming climates

36
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:49,100
and sort of the movement of species now finding
broader ranges

37
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,000
where they didn't use to have, and what effect

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,720
that has on the ecosystem.

39
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:58,289
Recently, they’ve turned their attention
on hobbyists and citizen scientists

40
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:00,539
The bat detectors that we have now

41
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:07,819
used to cost thousands and thousands of dollars,
and only professionals had them.

42
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:12,560
Wildlife Acoustics makes a range of listening
devices and apps for iOS and Android

43
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,380
Like Song Sleuth, a five dollar app that’s
like the Shazam for birdsong

44
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:22,000
And one of their recent releases, the Echo
Meter Touch 2,

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,960
is basically the Shazam for bats

46
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:31,220
For $179, you can plug in this little accessory,
hold it up to a night sky, and listen for bats

47
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,070
The free app that comes with them can identify
them based on the way they echolocate, because

48
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:41,420
all nine species of bats in New York 
echolocate in different ways.

49
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,310
And for that reason, did you know that’s
why they all have different ears, to catch

50
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,900
sonar in different ways?

51
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,720
Some bats are echo locating over 100 kilohertz

52
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,440
Or 150 kilohertz

53
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,400
So it’s way beyond our range of hearing,
and it’s way beyond most microphones and

54
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,560
electronics by design.

55
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,040
The device brings it down to a frequency that
the human ear can hear, and that’s how you know

56
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,660
when to look up

57
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:12,720
And as they get closer and closer to a prey
item, they start echolocating faster and faster

58
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,320
and in the very end, when they’re right
on top of the moth,

59
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,030
it sounds a little bit like somebody giving
you the raspberry

60
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,680
So it’s like tch-tch-tch-tch-tch

61
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,880
Plllfffffttt!!!

62
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,920
It’s incredibly cool.

63
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,340
So far there’s no public database where
citizen scientists can upload their data

64
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,720
Thought both Danielle, through her nonprofit
Bat Conservation International

65
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,070
And Wildlife Acoustics say it’s something
they want to create

66
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,810
I will also say I had kind of a dream to have

67
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,240
many people conducting bat walks

68
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,510
so kind of like it becoming a thing.

69
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,250
So just so you know it’s a thing in England

70
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,430
People over there figured out it’s kind
of fun to listen to bats, because once you’ve

71
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,780
done it, it’s kind of addictive.

72
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:07,020
It hasn’t exactly caught on but I’m thinking
this technology, the new technology,

73
00:04:07,020 --> 00:00:00,000
mobile technology, could change everything.
