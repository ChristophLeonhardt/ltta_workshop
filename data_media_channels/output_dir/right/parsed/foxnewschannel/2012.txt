THE CLEAR EVIDENCE IS HOW BADLY
IRAN ONCE TO STAY IN THE DEAL
AND ARE SO DESPERATE TO STAY IN
THIS DEAL.
>> VERY ACCURATELY ENCAPSULATES
IT.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT IRAN ONCE TO
STAY IN THIS DEAL BECAUSE THEY
KNOW WHEN IT WAS CUT.
THEY GAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF
CASH IN EUROS AND ALLOW THEM TO
CONTINUE TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY
ALLOWING A BREAKOUT IN THE
AGREEMENT SUNSETS, AND FURTHER
EVIDENCE, FORMER SECRETARY OF
