apparently Mitch McConnell has made a new offer to Democrats on the government shutdown and they are going to pursue it they're going to they're going to go for it what exactly was his new offer so one last we left our epic story our epic story last week it looked like the Democrats were going to run this government shutdown into the ground their goal here was to make sure that Trump was in the middle of a government shutdown on the first anniversary of his inauguration they're outside goal may have been to make this thing last beyond the inauguration should be on the State of the Union address so the Trump would actually have to speak about the State of the Union in the middle of a government shutdown that looks like that's about to end and when I say about tenth I mean like right now as we are recording this show it looks like they're about to take a vote that will end the government shutdown which lasted all in all three days two and a half days and that comes to an end as Mitch McConnell the Senate Majority Leader offers the Democrats virtually nothing he says we will have a short-term CR that continuing resolution that funds the government through February 8th so it takes us past the State of the Union address and he says before we get there we will have a vote on tattoes who will try another three weeks to come up with a vote on zakah if not then I guess we'll have another government shutdown on February 8th when Democrats tried to attach deck legislation to the government did to the government budget to the continuing resolution remember that's how this whole thing went down in the first place we needed to fund the government the Democrats said we're not going to fund the government unless you give us daca unless you give us Obama's executive amnesty and shrine in law Republicans said we're not gonna do that unless you give us some concessions Democrats said no and then we went into this government shutdown that started Friday night and is over by Monday morning so it really is not even worth the worth the time here here was Chuck Schumer last week blaming Trump for it suggesting that it was all Trump's fault this government shutdown I love the the shutdown clock on CNN yeah I came back online Saturday night and but when I left for Sabbath in the government had not yet shut down and I came back on Saturday night and lo and behold everything was the same like literally all of the things were the same hey no one's check had not gone out it's that you have to wait till the first of the month from people's checks to not go out people were still going to receive their Social Security the government is still gonna collect all of its revenue you know the government was gonna continue to function a 90 percent of the government continues to function during a government shutdown 88 to 90 percent of the government continues to function as essential services during government shutdown and yet we were supposed to believe look at that counter on CNN that this was the end of the world right oh my god we're counting down to Armageddon the asteroid is finally gonna hit earth here was Chuck Schumer blaming Trump for it although Trump really had a little to do with it the Senate Minority Leader who thought that he was gonna get a big win out of this now it's possible Schumer can still get a win out of this if Mitch McConnell then makes a bad DAC a deal right he didn't say it was really the threat of my it was really the threat of my government shutdown that forced the Republicans into a bad deal they didn't want to redo this in February so a lot depends on what comes next but here's Senate Minority Leader Schumer going after Trump Americans know why the dysfunction is kurung a dysfunctional president hence we are in a trump shutdown and party leaders who won't act without them only president Trump can end it we Democrats are at the table ready to negotiate the president needs to pull up a chair and end this shutdown okay so the president did not in fact have to pull up a chair and end the shutdown Chuck Schumer ended the shutdown the White House was doing a pretty good job of undermining the Democratic claims on this the Democrats were basically making two claims one Republicans are responsible for the shutdown - we have to shut down the government to get data those claims are not coherent you cannot claim both right they they're sort of in conflict with one another anytime there's a government shutdown that one party is responsible for it in this case it was the Democrats who were filibustering right the Republicans had the votes do you get past the government shutdown to fund a continuing resolution Democrats were forcing that bar to go up to 60 votes as opposed to 51 in the Senate through use of the filibuster you can't argue we're shutting down the government because it's so important to shut down the government and also it's the other side's fault the government is shutting down right because message number one we're shutting down the government for the time the priority suggests the government shutdown is less important than the other priority message number two it's your fault suggest the government shutdown is a terrible thing and should never happen in any case so yeah a stupid move by the Democrats here was the white house comment line the White House did something clever when you call the white house comment line no one picks up the phone no one picked up the phone before but now they left an outgoing message saying the reason we're not here is because okay I love that I have to admit I really like that I think that that is good politics I think what the White House is doing by simply messaging it outright is smart Mike Pence did the same thing he was speaking in from the military and he was asked about about pay to American troops and here's what he had to say I'm sure you're all aware of what's going on in Washington DC despite bipartisan support for a budget resolution I know in the senate is decided to play politics with military pay which you deserve better you and your families shouldn't have to worry for one minute about whether you're gonna get paid as you serve in the uniform of the United States so know this your president your vice president and the American people are not gonna put up with it okay so that was you know all of this is smart politicking by the White House the the brood of those Breughel politicking came courtesy of Trump himself so the Trump administration released an ad accusing Democrats of being complicit in all murders by illegal immigrants basically suggesting that the the Democrats are upholding the rights of illegal immigrants to stay in the country over funding of our military and then going even further President Trump is right build the wall deployed criminals stop illegal immigration now Democrats who stand in our way will be complicit in every murder committed by illegal immigrants President Trump will fix our border and keep our families safe okay so this is what this is paid for by by Trump for president so this is his reelection campaign and he's running a full ad basically saying side with the illegal immigrants don't sides don't side with legal immigrants side with members of our military side with with the people who need to be funded by the budget this is hardcore politicking but I kind of like it I'll admit it you know people get very uptight about the Willie Horton ad which was taken out against Michael Dukakis who allowed a guy on furlough who then went out Willie Horton and killed Vica William Horton I guess and then killed a couple of people is my understanding and there was an ad that was quite brutal and it really hurt Michael Dukakis people are saying this ad is too much I don't see what's what's politically stupid about the ad most Americans agree with this they don't want Democrats standing up for illegal immigrants in the country for no reason they're not they're not up for that in the idea of Democrats siding with you legal immigrants over American citizens I think strikes them as weird that's why you know Paul Ryan came out he said he didn't think that this ad was necessarily productive but it was productive I mean it actually did help force the Democrats into a corner they were not winning this government shutdown at least in terms of the public debate well they're certainly not helping us keep the government open they're certainly not helping us getting to a solution and immigration when you shut down the government you can stop negotiating an immigration reform they're complicit with not getting things done I'm not gonna comment I just saw that I don't know if that's necessarily productive it's no secret the president strong views on immigration but what is not productive is a pointless government shutdown that the Senate Democrats have foisted on this country ok so you know I I disagreed with Ryan here I think it was productive during the government shutdown you got to bring the bricks and you got to hit each other with them I mean that's that's basically what Obama did during the last government shutdown now Trump did I think the White House did a fine job handling this what comes next is going to be questionable because again Mitch McConnell has offered a deal so I'm gonna talk about that deal in one second and what has to happen here because now the onus is sort of on Trump and so it'll be interesting to see this is the first time the Republicans are sort of gonna be divided on politics on any matter of serious consequence they were divided on Obamacare repeal there was confusion I think that there may be similar confusion I guess the second time there may be similar confusion over immigration I'll explain that in just a second first I want to say thank you to our sponsor is over at Skillshare so Skillshare is the place for you to broaden and deepen your resume that is what

year better than your last one was okay so speaking of the Republicans being confused on this what comes next after the government shutdown so as I say Mitch McConnell has promised that there will be a vote on immigration right that there will be a vote on immigration at some point here before February 8 what does that actually look like so the only deal that is currently on the table the only deal it's currently being discussed is a bill from Jeff Flake Republican of Arizona dick Durbin Democrat of Illinois and Lindsey Graham Republican of South Carolina and it would according to the hill offer a pathway to citizenship for so-called dreamers and permission to stay in the country for their parents and what would Republicans get in return for basically legalizing this could be up to eight million people they get two billion dollars in border security funding can be a giant fail of a bill a giant fail there would be no serious changes to the visa diversity lottery there'd be no serious changes to the to the chain migration laws there'd be no serious changes to immigration basically would be Trump caving on daca knowing the deadline is coming up in March and knowing that another deadline is coming up in terms of the continuing resolution as of February 8th now the White House opposes that deal they say 8 million illegal immigrants could be allowed to stay is according to Daily wire Graham meanwhile is attacking the special advisor to President Trump so Trump is being torn I think in within his administration a little bit over this particular issue the Lindsey Graham of course is the most dovish of all Republicans on immigration he says that Stephen Miller who's one of the president's special advisers on immigration is undermining the deal now I have to say I know Stephen I know I'm I wouldn't say like really really well but I know Stephen relatively well would there was a dinner that I was at in 2014 and the dinner was Jeff Sessions and Coulter Stephen Miller me and like one other guy and we were just sitting around talking immigration for deep into the night and Miller and Coulter were very much on the same page even in Milton and Ann are our friends I believe and Stephen is named Wang kind of immigration he's also incredibly hardline and immigration he's also in the president's ear on immigration the president is a lot harder core on immigration that he was even three years ago Lindsey Graham is very upset with Stephen Miller and he and he lashed out at him over the fact that Miller and the Trump administration are putting a crimp in his plans with regard to this immigration shutdown as long as Stephen Miller's in charge of negotiating immigration we're going nowhere he's been an outlier for years okay so the truth is that that Miller is a very hardcore guy at immigration but Graham is also an outlier he's much more dovish than the rest of the party this is just his latest and greatest attempt to move toward amnesty the the White House is firing back on Graham directly Hogan Ginley said quote as long as senator chooses to support legislation that size of people in this country illegally and unlawfully instead of our own American citizens were going nowhere he's been an outlier for years so this sets up the conflict right this sets up the conflict cuz Democrats are gonna offer some sort of pittance in exchange for daca Gutierrez I think this is um I'm training members luis Gutierrez Democrat of Illinois he came out he said about the government shutdown but he's really talking about daca then maybe we'll give Trump a little bit of funding for his wall if that's what we have to do in order to make sure that the dreamers stay then fine any deal approved by luis Gutierrez is a garbage deal okay that's the rule of thumb luis Gutierrez is the most dovish member of congress on immigration and particularly illegal immigration here's what he had to say look I think the wall is a monumental waste of taxpayers money and it's to build a monument to to stupidity and and it's just idiotic having said that if that's what it's going to take in order to put 800,000 young men and women in this country dreamers and put them in a safe place and put them on a course to full integration in our society if that's what the hostage takers of the dreamers if that's their ransom call I say pay it okay so if he's saying pay off the wall give him a couple billion bucks for the wall and then we'll get the dreamers in that's the deal that no Republican should take again this is a great lip mist test any time luis Gutierrez for something you run the other way you just run the other way and one of the problems here is that for President Trump when it comes to negotiation he has proved not to be particularly adept at negotiation with Democrats remember he signed off on a budget deal last year he undermined Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and what far more dovish on immigration I mean on the budget then his fellow Republicans would have had him do he got Republicans almost in trouble on this government shutdown like he tweeted out over the weekend this right here's what he tweeted quote great to see how hard Republicans are fighting for our military and safety at the border the Devens just wants illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked if stalemate continues Republicans should go to 51% nuclear option and vote on real long-term budget no continuing resolutions okay this is stupid strategy what he was doing in the middle here the whole point was to blame Democrats for the shutdown not to put the onus on Republicans to end the filibuster by going to the nuclear op which of course would grant Democrats basically the precedent to do the exact same thing when they get into power again which eventually they will I mean the chances of Republicans rule forever are extraordinarily low I would say even chances the Republican rule in midterms are diminished so you know Trump is not great at negotiation and this is the dirty little secret Trump is good at what he's good at signing things right saying stuff Trump is not great when it comes to these negotiations in Congress and so he should really stay out of them but now it looks like there's a divide in the Republican side of the aisle you got the Republican doves on immigration and Mitch McConnell has pledged to give a vote so what if the only bill that comes up is Graham's bill what are the Republicans in the House dudes they stymie it so the Republicans in the house turned down the Graham Bell did they fight against the Graham Bell do they say we'll go to another government shutdown and then the Democrats say hey listen the Republicans and we voted for a bill that would have averted the government shutdown and you guys wouldn't do it the Republicans have the stones to do that in the house after the Senate passes something and then does Trump have the capacity to actually veto something and that's the big question here Trump has never had to use his veto pen Grover Norquist during the election cycle made the suggestion that Trump's presidency was going to essentially be an autopen that Republicans would put up whatever they want in front of him and he would sign it and so far that's been exactly the case my Trump hasn't had to veto anything because he has a Republican Congress but what happens when his supposedly cherished priorities on immigration run up against the reality that a lot of Republicans disagree with him is he gonna veto such a bill is his tough talk anything but tough talk or is it just going to be that he lets it go pass no he's made signals in the past that he's gonna sign anything Congress puts in front of him including a bad daca deal if he does that he'll lose a lot of his base at least on immigration I don't think that a huge percentage will care but the Ann Coulter's Mickey couses of the world they'll be very upset obviously there give me a lot of people who feel like he betrayed them if after all of this hubbub over Obama's executive amnesty Republicans you know brought Republican Congress and Republican president Rhee enshrine it in response in in favor of two billion dollars in increased border security right this is this is not yeah the urgency is growing and there's a report today there's a report today that the border wall prototypes have been sitting there in the desert doing nothing right we have a bunch of prototypes they've been sitting there and meanwhile there's been a major surge there's been a major surge in the illegal immigration and it continues to grow because the economy is doing better this is how it always works by the way you know Obama got a lot of credit for diminished illegal immigration that was not because of Obama that was because the economy was not very good under Obama for most of his tenure it was only at the end it started to pick up in any real way and in the last year of course it's really been booming so people are pouring into the country Mexico is not doing as well so a lot of people are crossing the border illegally in December u.s. Border Patrol agents according to Breitbart apprehended almost 30,000 illegal immigrants trying to cross into the country between ports of entry that beware the border wall is the the idea that Republicans are going to cave on anything but that they may not have a full border wall they may not get a dented iversity visa lottery the idea they may not get an ended chain migration it speaks to the fact that Trump may not have any serious principles this is gonna be a real problem for him this is a it's it's a serious issue it's a serious problem so you know I think that this is gonna be Trump's really first test he hasn't been tested yet his first test is gonna be what if Congress disagrees with him what if Congress decides that they are not going to what if Congress decides that they are not going to go along with his hard core Stephen Miller immigration plan instead they're gonna go along with Lindsey Graham it's gonna open to open up some serious questions inside the Republican Party and that cannot be good for for President Trump so while the government shutdown is a loss for Schumer as it currently as it currently stands while the government shutdown does not look like a big win for Democrats on this it looks like they're going down in flames frankly with all of that said it depends on what comes next right the fact is that the polling for Democrats has been bad there's a late poll that was coming out in the last two weeks that showed well last week actually that showed that Republicans have been picking up serious ground in the Congressional polling it used to be Democrats plus 18 just two months ago now it was Democrats plus seven it's a major shift in favor of Republicans that's because of the tax cuts it's also because Chuck Schumer is doing a bad job the last thing Democrats want is another one of these government shutdowns Republicans do have some leverage here so I'm encouraging Republicans to not cave do not cave if Democrats shut down the government again they shut down the government again but do not give them a bill in the Senate it's going to be something they can't past the house and get past President Trump you need to go with Trump's agenda here at least you need to go with what Trump stated agenda was here because caving preemptively is really really foolish so here we go now let's move on to let's move on to them the Mueller investigation which has become more and more of a debacle over time more news that just is not good for the Mueller investigation first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at ranked on so you've heard me talk about rings innovative home security camera devices for for quite a while here they've been sending us actual footage of ring busting crooks in the act this is one that I want to share with you so here is the here's a little bit of clip okay there's a crazy-looking guy who walks up to a home the first thing you're gonna hear is him kicking in the door and then the homeowner catches him and starts talking to him over the ring device hey leave my house or I'm calling the police okay what you need to do here's my house stop now or I'm calling the police why would you tell me that because you're trying to push my door in leave now I'm calling the police okay well I mean I am the Senate I'm the police that this guy is so this will ring calm can do for you obviously the police then show up but this guy would have continued bashing in the door if the homeowners voice hadn't come on and started talking this crazy loon bag I mean this guy obviously has serious problems I hope he gets the help that he needs but I do have to laugh a little bit at the fact that the guy is asking the homeowner why is he talking to him you literally just tried to kick in his door and then when he says I am the police with all of his three teeth I'm no no you're not that's a good thing they had the ring yeah when you can see what's going on your front door and it gives you a lot more leeway to stop crime pretty empowering with the ring floodlight and spotlight cams you can build a ring of security around your entire property ring less you protect your home no matter

guy who wasn't home whose house was probably busted into by some guy looking exactly like that okay so this is actually big news that's breaking over the weekend representative Jim Jordan from Ohio he's gonna be on Facebook live with us a little bit later today because he wants to sort of give us the update on what's going on in the Mueller investigation there are a couple of pieces of breaking news that are quite crazy with regard to the Mueller investigation a lot of coincidences piling up with regard to the Mueller investigation how is conducted so you recall a lot of them come down to this one guy Peter stroke previous Raza can smell STR Z okay I have no idea how to pronounce this others pronounce a truck schrick I'll just pronounce it differently every time make fun of his name in any case this guy is an FBI agent he was having an affair with another FBI agent named Lisa Paige they were both working on the Trump Russia probe so we know that Strasse k was involved in the hillary clinton email investigation we know he had been involved in launching the Trump investigation and we know that he was staffed on it as well now we also know that Strock texted Paige on August 15 2016 regarding Trump quote I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe's office that there's no way he gets elected but I'm afraid we can't take that risk it's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you're 40 which makes it sound a lot like the Trump collusion investigation could be a way of stopping Trump's candidacy right it's an insurance policy against stopping Trump from becoming president now we learned that stroke and Paige send each other messages suggesting they knew before the FBI had reported to then Attorney General Loretta Lynch that Clint was going to be exonerated on July 1st 2016 you recall Obama Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced she'd do whatever FBI director Comey told her to do that announcement followed a tarmac meeting in Arizona between Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton that day stroke texted Paige quote timing looks like hell Paige responded it's a real Profile in Courage since she knows that no charges will be brought she's not supposed to know no charges will be brought right the FBI was not supposed to be telling the DOJ what their judgments on this case was until the judgment was out but apparently Comey and the rest of the FBI had been regularly informing the goj that hilary would not be prosecuted which is super corrupt and the coincidences don't stop there hey this is a crazy story this is the most insane coincidence of all so something like 400 pages of text messages between FBI agents have been delivered to the Senate Oversight Committee Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin he announced on Monday that the FBI had somehow failed to deliver months of text between stroke and page text beginning at December 14th 2016 ending May 17 2017 what happened that day that's the exact day that Mueller was appointed to head the investigation so in other words all text before Mueller took over the investigation from December to May were deleted the FBI says they were lost in a technical glitch how do you lose just the text that we need how's that you lose precisely the text that determine the shaping of that Russia collusion investigation during that period of time you had Trump's inauguration all of the activity with Mike Flynn Mike Flynn's firing the mana fort I believe that the man of fort investigation will ran into into high gear the firing of James Comey well all of this stuff was happening in that time and we have none of the texts between stroke and Carter page none of them so representative Jordan has called for a second special counsel to investigate the first special counsel now he tweeted out earlier today that it was time for some sort of investigation at first the IRS destroyed emails pivotal to our investigation of their political targeting now the FBI quote unquote failed to preserve tax between Peter stroke and Lisa page following the 2016 election the time is for a second Special Counsel is now well yes yes I believe that it is I believe that it is I mean just for the sake of my own peace of mind and the sake for the sake of peace of mind the American people there's a lot of suspicion of this investigation now there would have been any way but that suspicion is is really high particularly after the the so-called memo that people who want released that's supposed to shed light on how the FISA warrant was originally garnered from the from the Obama administration to check out Carter page and now you have all these deleted FBI texts and you have these texts between stroke and page C and and Lisa page no relation to Carter suggesting that there was a sort of conspiracy afoot in all of this it's just it's all insane I mean how was this investigation run this badly now Mueller was therefore all of this right he fired lisa page any fired peter stroke upon taking the office that's Angela Muller but you have sort of a fruit of the poisonous tree thing going on now in in law there's something called fruit of the poisonous tree basically the idea is that if I break into your house illegal and the police I break in your house illegally and I find evidence that you murdered someone I can't use that evidence in court because it's fruit of the poisonous tree because I broke the law in order to obtain the evidence well the same thing sort of holds true with regard to this investigation if the investigation was launched on the basis that there was a democratic Apple Research file from fusion GPS that was used for political reasons by the FBI to target Carter page and therefore the Trump campaign and if it turns out that's separate from that the FBI was exonerating Hillary Clinton for political reasons at the same time they're investigating Trump and if it turns out that's separate from that they're members of the FBI who are texting each other that the Trump Mueller and that the Trump collusion investigation was actually a way to prevent Trump from becoming president and and if after that it turns out that the FBI purposefully deleted months of texts between two of their key agents and all of this I think the American people have a right to know and the American people might have some serious questions all of this calls into serious question our faith in our institutions it was our lack of faith that this is deeply troubling to me the lack of faith in our institutions that already exists is deep and abiding it's a serious serious problem right the lack of faith in our institutions is what led to the rise of Donald Trump it's what leads it's it's frankly what's led to the growth of government because people instead of instead of looking at the institution's and figuring those institutions are corrupt take all the power away from them instead they say well if we just had a guy who will break all the rules and use the power of those institutions to reinstall virtue everything will be great unfortunately the human tendency is not toward liberty when it comes to misuse of institutions it's toward the belief that those institutions can be corrected if they have the proper leadership the founders disagreed but that's unfortunately how most people think none of this is good right you want institutions that are worthy of our trust right now I'm not sure the FBI is completely worthy of our trust if what we're hearing is true the Obama DOJ certainly was not worthy of our trust now for all the flack that Jeff sessions has gotten Jeff sessions is DOJ has operated much more along the lines of law than the Obama DOJ is I mean you literally have the sitting Attorney General of the United States calling himself the President of the United States his wingman right then that is not exactly what we want from the head of the DOJ and the chief law enforcement officer in the country all these institutions now need a thorough cleansing top-to-bottom they they they all need to feel clean to the American people I don't know if Trump is capable of doing that by the way it may be left up to the next president because Trump is so politicized because his presidency is so despised by so many anything he does is not gonna be seen as cleaning house except by members of his base and maybe some Republicans but that said another oversight investigation of this of this investigation may be necessary the Mueller investigation itself may be fatally flawed at this point we'll have to see what comes out from it Democrats are hoping there's a killer shot in there if there is no kill shot then this is going to be seen I think half rightly as Trump says is one of the greater political witch hunts in modern American political history if nothing major comes out of this and went on for a year and it was Democrats in the media propping up this nonsense then there's gonna be hell to pay there will be political hell to pay and Democrats will have made a huge huge mistake one that in its inception goes back again as always to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama okay so in just a minute I want to talk about the women's March that happened over the weekend I want to talk about the pro-life march that happened over the weekend things I like things I hate a

dick durbin is thanking Democratic senators for shutting down the government over daca he's trying to make excuses for why he led them into the suicide strategy into this box canyon of politics he said you suck your nuts out and I'm gonna go on record even if it's hard to explain back home yeah that's code for it's hard to explain back home and then we made a big mistake here and then he dumped on Trump a lot and talked about how Trump was really bad but Democrats obviously lost on this one then they all they lost Louise Gutierrez has tweeted out quote if I have to give a brick if I have to give a brick for every dreamer Trump releases if it offends me but I'll help build the wall if that's what it takes but now that we have offered the wall they want cuts to legal immigration right so now he's saying that he's very angry that Republicans are gonna stick to Republican principles as well they should as well they should so we'll see how all of this plays out and whether the Republicans have the stomach to actually stand up for all of this so I guess that the the next CR the next continuing resolution is Toby rave so if you enjoyed this government shutdown you'll get government shutdown to the revenge on February 8th unless we are unless there's some sort of deal that gets cut okay so meanwhile over the weekend there were a couple of big marches one was the pro-life march the other was the women's March the pro-life March is one of the great events that happens every year hundreds of thousands of people show up in Washington DC to protest the roe v wade decision for those who don't know the roe v wade decision is legitimately one of the worst judicial decisions in the history of the United States it stands up alongside Dred Scott as an egregious violation of human rights as well as a breach of constitutional protocol there is nothing in the Constitution nothing zero things about your right to kill your own baby nothing in fact there's a good case to be made that the the Constitution of the United States which is dedicated to protecting equal protection of the laws that that should apply to unborn children that the idea that you should be able to kill a child for convenience is just plainly insane this is a case the pro-life movement makes they say the Fourteenth Amendment guaranteeing equal protection of the laws should apply to unborn children the roe v wade decision which is based on a bunch of pseudoscience about what babies what fetal development looks like and when babies are viable and all of this stuff it's sure not it's been garbage forever it's based on a series of cases that established a non-existent right to privacy now there is a right against unreasonable search and seizure in the Constitution of the United States that is not the same thing as a right to privacy you do not have a blanket right to privacy certainly not one that extends to you doing something as non private as going out to a doctor and having that doctor perform a surgery on a on you that kills a baby that is not a private act okay it is not a private your medical records may be private right and and they're guarded against government unreasonable search and seizure but if you are acting on a third party way under libertarian principles libertarians can take a pro-life position here if that baby is a baby you do not get to harm it just as if I am a person you do not get to harm me but the latter is probably more questionable than the former so the fact that the as far as the humanity of the people involved the fact is that the pro-life March it's it's demonstrative of the fact there are a lot of people in the United States who still care about civil rights it's so funny the media do this routine where they talk about the great civil rights issues of our time now they're always trying to make things I can to liken make analogies between between race and the and women's issues or race and gay issues or race and transgender issues none of these comparisons hold women are not treated remotely like black people were treated in the United States today gay people are not treated remotely like black people were treated in the United States also the idea that that homosexual acts are on the same par as color of skin is inane and it just logically does not hold to suggest that even if there were government regulation of homosexual activity which I oppose by the way right I'm a libertarian I oppose that but even if there were that is not the same thing as regulations on somebody's race right race is an immutable characteristic sexual activity is activity right your orientation may be immutable may be I mean there's there's some scientific evidence that goes both ways but there's no question that activity is mutable right all activity is mutable so it's not quite the same thing as I'm discriminating against you because of the color of your skin so that analogy doesn't hold either the transgender analogy certainly doesn't hold the idea that transgender people in the United States are being treated like black people in the United States or that these two things are akin that the the disorder that is gender identity disorder or gender dysphoria whatever you wish to call it that is akin to being black is just in say again there is no manifestation in behavior with regard to with regard to being black there is manifestation and behavior with regard to transgenderism inherently so long as you are claiming you're a member of the opposite sex in any case there is one civil rights issue that is very much akin to the civil rights issues that are facing black folks and that is the treatment of unborn children as second-class citizens or worse as channel right the truth is that when you're talking about the murder of unborn citizens what you are talking about is more on par with slavery than it is with Jim Crow you're talking about killing you're talking about the treatment of people as property right well you're talking about when you say that a mother has the right to to abort her baby for any reason whatsoever is that that baby is her property and she can dispose of it suo the people who are marching in washington d.c deserve the same respect as civil rights heroes as the media tried to accord to the women's marchers i mean the media i've been making this big deal out of women's marchers again women have never had it better in the history of mankind than they have in the united states today they just have not okay and anybody who argues with this knows nothing about world history or about multiculturalism they're celebrating cultures very often that hate women that despise women but the women's marches nonetheless have been have been paid honor and tribute by the vast majority of media outlets that are given front-page status my understanding is the attendance was way off this year from the women's marches last year because the women's marches last year were coincidence with with trump's inauguration they they have millions people attended those i don't think the women's marches this year nowhere were anywhere close to that what what i'm seeing is that um let's see it looks like they have a they have a list here over at heavy calm so in New York is about 85,000 people I guess that is not close to what it was last year in Richmond Virginia is like a thousand people in Chicago they that Chicago was the only place where actually increased apparently the 300,000 people who participate in the March there were only about 12,000 people in DC last year through half a million people half a million people in LA a lot of people showed up there are about 700,000 who participated last year there about 500,000 participated this year a lot of bored people who feel like marching on a Sunday the weather was good yesterday so I guess that if you have nothing better to do I guess you can go in March also all these women and then we're watching the football so I guess they they left their boyfriends and husbands at home and decided to go March for women's rights while their husbands at home and ate Cheetos and actually enjoyed themselves so again the idea of these women are marching for anything material I'm wondering what exactly they're marching for they always say equal pay for equal work they've achieved equal pay for equal work if they're marching for broader acceptance of opposition to sexual harassment and sexual assault I don't know what they're marching for since I'm not sure who is in favor of sexual harassment and sexual assault outside of Hollywood executives and apparently all of the fellow actors of the actresses who are speaking at this March nonetheless Jessica Chastain appeared on Saturday Night Live to push the women's marches and here's what she had to say especially today because this weekend is the one-year anniversary of the women's March today hundreds of thousands of people were out there for the cause and they are so so brave because it's the worst flu season ever I wish I could have been there marching alongside them ok well March with you Jessica yeah yeah I'm always wearing practical Footwear okay is this funny did I miss the part where I stand I'll turned it into literally just a fundraiser for a Democrat it's really really awful remember this on Saturday Night Live is a show that used to be funny at some point and now we've got a bunch of women who can't sing yeah first of all if you can't sing don't sing okay I'm a good violinist and I don't make my violin playing the centerpiece of what I do because I'm not at the level of Hilary Hahn right these women cannot sing at all and yet SNL features them every week singing but I guess that the me2 movement means that they also get to sing badly but they get to see more often because I guess the day they're there social justice warrior ring Jessica Chastain by the way is unbelievably wealthy right judge Jessica Chastain made at least a couple of million dollars for the Martian and people are complaining Oh Matt Damon made 18 million dollars for the Martian and Jessica Chastain only made a couple of million bucks for the Martian right she's in it for like ten minutes it was just like a chest ain't even in the Martian I gotta remember her being in it right the entire movie is Matt Damon on Mars that's the entire film of course he made more money also Matt Damon happens to be something called a box office draw and nobody goes to see a Jessica Chastain movie no one I like Jessica Chastain is an actress I think she's good but the idea that people went to see zero dark thirty because they were desperate to see Jessica Chastain in a film what is Molly's game earned I want to look at the earnings from Molly's game okay Molly's game is now out so what's it let's look at the let's look at the box office let's see if we can get some box office stat for that massive hit right it has now earned twenty eight point 1 million dollars miss Sloan right which she also said which she also starred in last year earn a whopping nine point 1 million dollars at the box office ok the last time the judge I'm gonna look up Jessica Chastain's I am IMDB because whenever people complain about the wage gap in Hollywood it makes no sense whatsoever all of her films that have been successful we're successful because everyone else right because everyone else in the film is a box-office draw now that should be totally Frank about this here are the films that she starred in where she was the leading lady okay woman walks ahead never even heard of it zookeeper his wife her nothin miss Sloan a total box-office bomb crimson peak mmm the Martian Matt Damon star made lots of money a most violent year very small film and the Oscar it's a her and Oscar Isaac she's very good in it but again very small film interstellar she's not the star of it Matthew McConaughey's the star of it and it's Christopher Nolan film so it made lots of money the disappearance of Eleanor Rigby made no money Salome mama she's mama and Annabel okay but but it's but that is not actually or no she's Annabel in the movie mama which I've never even heard of zeros are thirty like these are not big box office draws none of them zero of these things are big box office drugs but we're supposed to worry about her wage gap with Matt Damon okay like I'm gonna read you Matt Damon's IMDB okay okay Matt Damon's IMDB heard of the films the Matt Damon has starred in over the last few years okay he was the producer on Jason Bourne which made a bajillion dollars okay he was also let's see what did he what he acted oh so he was he was in thor ragnarok where he was uncredited he was in the great while which made a bajillion dollars in China Jason Bourne made a bajillion dollars the Martian a bajillion dollars interstellar bajillion dollars i Elysium which is a big-budget but it busted you know the guy's actually a box-office run then people are like oh well why is she earning what's the Matt Damon okay what women are marching for if you're marching for we want to be treated equally then I'm gonna treat you equally you suck at singing don't sing ever again on national TV okay let's just start with that and also if you're gonna stand for equality I'd like half of Jessica Chastain's paycheck for every movie that she makes because my goodness all these women on SNL I mean for the quality and by the way everyone on SNL should donate their salary to charity given the fact they suck so much lately just awful it wasn't by the way just just to catch a stain the Kerstin Bell over the weekend there was the the SAG Awards and I haven't seen this movie three billboards which is winning all of the which is winning all the awards have you seen it get Mathis so we'll have to see it no I'll give you my opinion after I see it because I have a feeling I'm not going to like it very much that's why I've been holding off on seeing it but any case Kirsten Belle felt the need to slap at Melania and Melania Trump because why not I mean it's just it's just such a fun thing to do good evening my friends welcome to the 24th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards you know there has never been a host for this award show before yeah it's the first time first person first lady right and I honestly never thought that I would grow up to be the first lady but you know what I kind of like it I think my first initiative as first lady will be cyberbullying because I have yet to see any progress made on that problem quite yet and I'm looking at you Tony Hale you're a bully you guys he's savage on Twitter I'm serious it's obviously that's left Melania is leading a cyber bullying initiative because president Trump is a bully on Twitter ah-ha-ha-ha-ha a trump joke yeah okay so there's that Kristen Bell by the way is a massive Lib she she loves to plan as she she loves to campaign on behalf of Planned Parenthood she's very very Pro pro-choice in pro abortion also I'm gonna say something politically incorrect now okay when when all of these women are pushing times up and they're pushing don't sexually harass me and they're pushing treat me the same as men and then Kirsten Bell wears a dress that is cut down to the navel I'm just suggesting to women that if you want men to treat you in a non-sexual eyes duay that that may not be the strongest move the suggestion is now you can dress however you want and men still shouldn't treat you in any way other than respectful but just as it is a point of risk allocation and as a point of you don't want to be true you want to be treated less in a certain way there's certain activities that you can do that will make you treated more in a certain way okay wear a dress cut down your navel men are going to look at your dress differently than if you do not wear a dress cut down your navel end of story that's just the way human nature works again that's not a justification but it is it is a a hint okay time for some things I like and then some things I hate and then a Federalist paper so things I like over the weekend I was I've just started on my latest Brandon Sanderson book I'm a big fantasy sci-fi fan there are not very good many good fantasy books is the truth most fantasy books are quite terrible there are some pretty good sci-fi books there are a lot of good sci-fi books actually I would suggest that a lot of the books in the Star Wars canon are better than a lot of the sequels that've been made the Timothy's on books and I'm reading those when I was younger and I remember really enjoying this I'll have to go back and reread them but any case one of the better fantasy writers on the scene - dad say the best is Brandon Sanderson he has his new book out called oath bringer but Oathbreaker oath bringer I'll check it out but in any case the old trilogy that he wrote that's really good is the Mistborn trilogy I believe they're making a series out of this now it's really creative and he does a lot of world-building so the entire basis of it is that there's a certain set of people a certain set of skilled people who basically swallow metal and then can use their bodies almost as magnets it's it's very bizarre but it's really interesting it's in an alternate reality of course Brandon Sanderson's very good writer his books are a little over long but that's just John respec there's not such a thing as a fantasy book that is under long write every fantasy book is 700 pages it sells by the pound not even by the page but the Mistborn trilogy is really worth reading so go ahead and check that out it's a lot of fun ok other things that I like so I was ripping on Hollywood earlier but I will say that the SAG Awards did something correct they did something better than the Emmy Awards they actually invited some of the women who had been victimized in me too and then they and then they had them speak so they had Rosanna Arquette and Marisa Tomei who paid silent and paid tribute to the silence breakers I believe Rosanna Arquette is one of the original women who alleged something she alleged that she was assaulted I believe by Harvey Weinstein if I'm not incorrect in any case they actually invited the women which was something that the Emmys should have done and they spoke about it openly which if Hollywood wants to get past this they should all do Rosanna you are one of those voices you're one of the silence breakers and we all owe you a debt of gratitude I'm here supporting many women how's your gentle Ohana Bella Shora Ashley Ashley judge Daryl Hannah Mira Sorvino so many Anthony Rapp from the happy rap thank you Olivia Munn thank you okay so is still the one who never gets mentioned her is Rose McGowan who got the whole thing started in the first place she's still been blackballed by Hollywood so I guess that she's never gonna be thanked from the stage but at least they're starting to bring for the actual woman who did this as opposed to the posturing from a bunch of women who didn't actually say anything about this stuff for years okay other things that I like so the Eagles beat the Vikings yesterday which is too bad I was rooting for the Vikings at least insofar as I was rooting which is not very hard but this was pretty funny so a lot of the Eagles fans had been climbing they've been an evening with poles over there apparently the Eagles fans when they win have been climbing the actual like light poles in the city but this guy had a different experience of the pole in he was running after the bus in in Philadelphia after the game and as if this is the hardest shot than anybody took from the minute this is a harder shot than anybody took from the Minnesota defense yesterday he's running wound tough actin tinactin oh he just takes one right in the kisser and he's running and OH hammered Wow okay okay he's running up for the subway I guess I'm there's no way not to laugh at that okay it's just like he's really picked up see what my question is what he was running for like it's already it's already moving you're not gonna like stop the bus or stop the or stop the car boom okay if you can enjoy that folks and I guess you just can't enjoy life the guy's fine by the way at least from from what I understand or he's dead I haven't really checked it out but that's it but that's funny the way that's going around the internet if something bad had happened the guy would already know about okay time for a couple of quick things I hate and then the Federalist number 12 so so what I love about every government shutdown is well nothing actually changed for nearly all Americans the the media suggested that all would end all would die end of world okay so this is my favorite aspect in the CNN ran a report about how because of the government shutdown asteroids could destroy earth I am not kidding like Bruce Willis would be on break and he would not be able to actually sacrifice himself in favor of Ben Affleck bad move by the way never sacrifices yourself in favor of Ben Affleck but the idea that that the government would be on break and that if something terrible happened we would all die because Trump and Schumer couldn't come to an agreement over data the over data registration or something here's CNN's report about how an asteroid could murder us all in our sleep and in space that same year for more than two weeks NASA reportedly stopped monitoring potentially dangerous asteroids a big one by the way is expected to brush by Earth on February 4th ok bye bye the idea by the way that a big one is about to brush by earth by February 4th I mean this one is going to miss us by a bajillion bye bajillion miles ok this this asteroid is not going to come close to hitting the it's not gonna come close to hitting the earth but and if it were I promise you that the government would try to do its best about it we wouldn't all just die we wouldn't have like a dinosaur level extinction event because there is a government shutdown for three days is it's just ridiculous it's just ridiculous it's it's not gonna come particularly close like it misses us by a huge margin actually it misses us by a by a huge swath so it's supposed to fly safely past the earth on February 4th there been a bunch of asteroids that have been flying past us but missing us by a fair warning it's missing us by oh my goodness and they have a chart here on how on how much it's missing us by and the answer is 2.6 million miles so a lot a lot okay so other things that I hate Jimmy Kimmel again does not understand government shutdowns and he is just all he does now is take talking points from Chuck Schumer again I don't understand why Hollywood feels the need to do this but the more they do the better it is for Trump so I guess good for them keep it keep it going you're gonna win Republicans to Congress again here's Jimmy Kimmel deciding that he needs to speak out of politics again because obviously me shellacking him over his a the other nine times hasn't done anything hello I'd like a cappuccino please okay great that's one cappuccino and one giant bag of whore but I know what a bag of horse gets you know it's kind of a two-for-one thing I want the cappuccino you also have to pay for a giant bag of hork well what if I just want the cappuccino whoa buddy you start making demands like that I will shut down this entire coffee establishment don't shut down the store you work at yeah it's absurd your job is to sell coffee okay that is not in fact what is happening the Republicans offered a separate chip bill back in December Democrats shot it down because Democrats do not want spending offsets Republicans included full funding for six years for the chip bill in this current continuing resolution Democrats tried to shut it down anyway okay so that's not what's happening this happens every time there's a government shutdown every time there's a government shutdown they put forward to continuing resolution with a lot of goodies in it to make the other side look bad that's just the way that it goes okay so that is what is alright time for a quick analysis of the Federalist number 12 so we go through a federalist paper every week we've gone through eleven of them already so we're now in Federalist number 12 is Alexander Hamilton talking about why a federal government wise strong nationalized government is going to be able to gather more revenue than state governments would able would be able to be first Hamilton gives a really good a really good defense of capitalism here's what he says it says quote it has been found in various countries that in proportion as Commerce has flourished land has risen in value and how could it have happened otherwise could that which procures a free event for the products of the earth with furnishes new incitements to the cultivation of land which is the most powerful instrument in increasing the quantity of money in a state could that in fine which is faithful handmade of Labor and Industry in every shape failed to augment that article which is prolific parents have far the greatest part of objects upon which they are exerted that's complicated language for saying it makes land more valuable and the economy is good right believe it or not this was not this was not actually common knowledge back at the time Hamilton was writing this he's read Adam Smith some of the other founders had not he says the Commerce creates revenue to the federal government he says that he recommends no direct taxation now it's fascinating he's the the founders believed that the government would not have the power to actually levy an income tax there'd be no direct taxation instead they were forced to revert to what they called excise taxes which were basically sales taxes as well as tariffs now they spoke out in favor of tariffs in a different way than they would today because Commerce today is so much easier so it was a lot easier to control tariffs than it would be today considering that the United States had essentially one long border and also the United States was three weeks ride from any other place on earth that was capable of trading with it essentially he recommended excise taxes and tariffs he says it's evidence we must a long time depend for the means of revenue chiefly on such duties in most parts excises must be confined within a narrow compass the genius of the people will ill brookie inquisitive and peremptory spirit of excise laws he says we could try to do sales tax that people are going to avoid it he says the pockets of farmers on the other hand will reluctantly yield but scanty supplies in the unwelcome shape of impositions on their houses so he says the land tax probably won't do it either especially because there's so much land here for people to settle and he says personal property is too precarious and so we won't be able to do that either a lot of the reason that they did tariffs in the early days of the of the United States is because it was impossible to gather taxes any other way not because they were in favor of tariffs as a principle there's an important point because a lot of people today will suggest that tariffs were something favored by the founders as good trade policy that's not true the founders were not all in favor of tariffs in fact they only were using tariffs because they had no other available option for gathering tax revenues right hehe suggests that apparently there was a three percent tariff essentially there was a fifteen percent tariff in Britain and there is a higher tariff in in France and a higher tariff even in Britain he wanted a nine percent tariff and suggested beginning with an alcohol tax on terrifying alcohol that was coming into the United States so that gives you a load a background on the founding ideology with regard to taxation which was very light footstep and that's why when people talk about how the founding fathers would be anti-government shut down the founding fathers would not care at all the god founding fathers would look at our tax rates and go are you out of your damn minds are you guys crazy are you crazy and Hamilton sort of does that in backhanded fashion in Federalist twelve okay way back here tomorrow with the full review of the Democrats caving on the government shutdown i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show the Ben Shapiro
