PRESIDENT.

13
00:00:33,596 --> 00:00:37,566

14
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:40,035
AND THE PANEL IS PIVOTAL.

15
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:43,806
AND KIM JONG-UN SENT HIS OWN

16
00:00:43,806 --> 00:00:45,407
EMISSARY LARGELY TO DELIVER

19
00:00:50,346 --> 00:00:52,114
HE'S TELLING SECRETARY POMPEO

00:00:52,114 --> 00:00:55,751
THAT KIM JONG-UNMENTES THE

21
00:00:55,751 --> 00:00:57,720
SUMMIT TO GO FORWARD AFTER

22
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,323
A WEEK PRIOR OF CONFUSING

23
00:01:01,323 --> 00:01:03,926
SIGNALS THAT BROUGHT OUR

24
00:01:03,926 --> 00:01:08,264
PRESIDENT TO TERMINATE THE

25
00:01:08,264 --> 00:01:08,931
SUMMIT.

26
00:01:08,931 --> 00:01:13,836
AND HE'S LIKELY TO COMMIT TO THE

27
00:01:13,836 --> 00:01:14,370
DENUCLEARIZATION.

28
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,738
AND ALSO IN RETURN.

29
00:01:15,738 --> 00:01:18,140

31
00:01:21,443 --> 00:01:21,877
DEFINITELY.

32
00:01:21,877 --> 00:01:24,513
IT IS A YOUNG MAN AND HE'S

33
00:01:24,513 --> 00:01:26,081
LOOKING DOWN MANY DECADES OF

34
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:27,850
LIFE IN THAT REGIME.

35
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,321
I THINK WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE

36
00:01:32,321 --> 00:01:38,427
MEETINGS TOMORROW, SECRETARY

37
00:01:38,427 --> 00:01:40,229
POMPEO IS WHAT DOES

38
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:41,764
DENUCLEARIZATION MEAN TO YOU.

39
00:01:41,764 --> 00:01:45,534
>> HOW MUCH OF THEIRARS NEL AND

40
00:01:45,534 --> 00:01:47,069
PREPATORY PROGRAM AND SPEED AND

41
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:49,571
SO MANY OTHER THINGS THAT HE'S

42
00:01:49,571 --> 00:01:54,443
GOING TO HAVE TO GET COLD HARD

43
00:01:54,443 --> 00:01:55,277
FACTS.

44
00:01:55,277 --> 00:01:57,513
>> Shannon: A NEW U.S.

45
00:01:57,513 --> 00:01:59,281
INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT

46
00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:01,383
CONCLUDED THAT NORTH KOREA DOES

47
00:02:01,383 --> 00:02:05,287
NOT INTEND TO GIVE UP NUCLEAR

48
00:02:05,287 --> 00:02:06,689
WEAPONS ANY TIME SOON.

49
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:08,824
EVERYBODY KNOWS THEY ARE NOT

50
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:13,595
GOING TO DENUCLEAR ZIEZ, WHAT DO

51
00:02:13,595 --> 00:02:15,931
YOU MAKE OF THAT REPORT.

52
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:19,535
>> THAT IS NOT A SURPRISING

53
00:02:19,535 --> 00:02:21,837
REPORT PRIOR TO THE BLITZ THAT

54
00:02:21,837 --> 00:02:25,207
KIM JONG-UN STARTED AND HAS BEEN

55
00:02:25,207 --> 00:02:29,478
IN FULL THROTTLE SINCE THE FINAL

56
00:02:29,478 --> 00:02:29,812
WEEK.

57
00:02:29,812 --> 00:02:32,247
AND I THINK THE FRAMEWORK THAT

58
00:02:32,247 --> 00:02:35,284
WILL TELL US THIS, WE'LL PROBE

59
00:02:35,284 --> 00:02:39,488
THEM BECAUSE WE NEED A FULL

60
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,358
ACCOUNTING OF THE WEAPON AND

61
00:02:42,358 --> 00:02:43,525
MISSILES.

62
00:02:43,525 --> 00:02:45,160
>> Shannon: YOU KNOWLEDGE THEY

63
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,130
WILL GIVE LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY.

64
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:48,430
IN

65
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,733
>> IF THEY DON'T WE'LL NOT GO

66
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:51,700
FAR WITH THEM.

67
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,936
THEY HAVE TO TELL US WHERE THEY

68
00:02:53,936 --> 00:02:54,236
ARE.

69
00:02:54,236 --> 00:02:56,872
AND THEN WE WOULD PUT IN PLAY

70
00:02:56,872 --> 00:02:58,841
A PROCESS WITH THEIR COOPERATION

71
00:02:58,841 --> 00:03:06,348
TO VERIFY AND OVERSEE THE ACTUAL

72
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:09,918
DISARMING OF THE SYSTEM AND THEY

73
00:03:09,918 --> 00:03:12,654
WANT IT TO GO WAY BEYOND THE

74
00:03:12,654 --> 00:03:14,790
TERM OF OFLS AND MAKE IT IN

75
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,558
A PHASED PROGRAM.

76
00:03:16,558 --> 00:03:21,430
AND IN THE MEANTIME AS THEY END,

77
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,100
THEY WANT MORE SANCTION RELIEF.

78
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,737
AND THEY HAVE EASY WINDS HERE.

79
00:03:28,737 --> 00:03:32,608
YOU CAN WIN THE ARMS AND

80
00:03:32,608 --> 00:03:33,008
ARMISTICE.

81
00:03:33,008 --> 00:03:34,810
AND BRING THE FAMILIES FROM THE

82
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,445
NORTH AND SOUTH TOGETHER THAT

83
00:03:36,445 --> 00:03:40,549
ARE SEPARATED FROM THE WAR AND

84
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:42,418
AGREE IN PRINCIPLE TO HAVE

85
00:03:42,418 --> 00:03:43,085
SECURITY.

86
00:03:43,085 --> 00:03:45,921
AND THE TOUGH ONE IS GETTING

87
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:50,993
DOWN TO WHAT THEY MEAN BY

88
00:03:50,993 --> 00:03:51,527
DENUCLEARIZATION.

89
00:03:51,527 --> 00:03:54,596
AND ONE OF THE CRITIQUES OF THE

90
00:03:54,596 --> 00:03:57,132
IRAN PLAN, IT IS GOING TO BE

91
00:03:57,132 --> 00:03:59,668
A KEY STICKING POINT.

92
00:03:59,668 --> 00:04:03,739
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A KEY

93
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:04,273
DENUCLEARIZATION.

94
00:04:04,273 --> 00:04:11,447
IT IS CLEAR TOMORROW.

95
00:04:11,447 --> 00:04:15,184
>> YOU SAW HE WILL NOT BE MRAPD

96
00:04:15,184 --> 00:04:16,517
BY THESE GUYS.

97
00:04:16,517 --> 00:04:18,887
IF THE SUMMIT IS ONGOING AND

98
00:04:18,887 --> 00:04:19,788
MOVING OUT.

99
00:04:19,788 --> 00:00:00,000
IF THIS IS NOT HEADING TO THE
