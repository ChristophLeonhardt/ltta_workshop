1
00:00:12,767 --> 00:00:13,467
>> Laura: TIME FOR ANOTHER

2
00:00:13,467 --> 00:00:14,101
INSTALLMENT OF OUR SERIES

3
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:14,802
DEFENDING THE FIRST WHERE WE

4
00:00:14,802 --> 00:00:16,203
EXPOSE THE ENEMIES OF THE

5
00:00:16,203 --> 00:00:16,971
FIRST AMENDMENT, FREE EXPRESSION

6
00:00:16,971 --> 00:00:22,376
AND FREE THOUGHT.

7
00:00:22,376 --> 00:00:23,577
HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER IN

8
00:00:23,577 --> 00:00:24,979
BROWNSBURG, INDIANA, SAYING THAT

9
00:00:24,979 --> 00:00:26,480
HE WAS FORCED TO RESIGN AFTER

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,849
YOU CHALLENGE THE DISTRICT'S

11
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:31,385
POLICY ON TRANSGENDER STUDENTS.

12
00:00:31,385 --> 00:00:32,386
THAT POLICY REQUIRES TEACHERS TO

13
00:00:32,386 --> 00:00:34,589
ADDRESS THESE STUDENTS BY THEIR

14
00:00:34,589 --> 00:00:35,356
PREFERRED NAME INSTEAD OF THEIR

15
00:00:35,356 --> 00:00:38,159
BIRTH NAME.

16
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:40,194
TEACHER JOHN SAYS THAT THAT

17
00:00:40,194 --> 00:00:40,895
VIOLATES BOTH HIS RELIGIOUS

18
00:00:40,895 --> 00:00:41,396
BELIEFS HE AND HIS

19
00:00:41,396 --> 00:00:43,998
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT.

20
00:00:43,998 --> 00:00:46,167
I RECENTLY SPOKE TO MR. CUVIER

21
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:48,569
AND HIS ATTORNEY AND I BEGAN BY

22
00:00:48,569 --> 00:00:51,406
CHALLENGING ON WHETHER THE

23
00:00:51,406 --> 00:00:52,140
SCHOOL DISTRICT REALLY VIOLATED

24
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,977
THE CLIENT'S RIGHTS.

25
00:00:55,977 --> 00:00:57,578
YOU CAN'T USE THE CLASSROOM FOR

26
00:00:57,578 --> 00:00:58,780
ANYTHING YOU WANT TO DO SPEECH

27
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,348
WISE, I MEAN, YOU ARE UNDER

28
00:01:00,348 --> 00:01:02,951
CONTRACT WITH THE SCHOOL.

29
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:04,185
IF SOMEBODY IS A TEACHER OF

30
00:01:04,185 --> 00:01:05,787
ANTHROPOLOGY WANTS TO GET UP AND

31
00:01:05,787 --> 00:01:11,593
TALK ABOUT HIS OR HER VIEW ON

32
00:01:11,593 --> 00:01:12,861
NAZISM OR CREATIONISM, THAT IS

33
00:01:12,861 --> 00:01:15,130
MY FREE SPEECH, GAS, BUT YOU ARE

34
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,499
UNDER CONTRACT WITH THE SCHOOL

35
00:01:17,499 --> 00:01:17,999
TO TEACH SPANISH.

36
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:20,769
SO YOU CAN BE FIRED FOR THAT,

37
00:01:20,769 --> 00:01:21,102
CORRECT?

38
00:01:21,102 --> 00:01:23,972
>> YES, TO YOUR POINT, WE

39
00:01:23,972 --> 00:01:26,141
BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A

40
00:01:26,141 --> 00:01:26,808
CONSTRUCTIVE DISCHARGE HERE.

41
00:01:26,808 --> 00:01:29,444
THAT THEY UNREASONABLY THREW OUT

42
00:01:29,444 --> 00:01:30,679
AN ACCOMMODATION THAT WAS IN

43
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:31,179
PLACE.

44
00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:33,014
THEY ACTUALLY HAD A WRITTEN

45
00:01:33,014 --> 00:01:36,584
AGREEMENT TO ALLOW JOHN TO

46
00:01:36,584 --> 00:01:37,919
EXPRESS HIS CONVICTIONS BY USING

47
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:40,188
ONLY LAST NAMES OF ALL OF THE

48
00:01:40,188 --> 00:01:40,622
STUDENTS.

49
00:01:40,622 --> 00:01:42,390
THAT REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION

50
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:42,991
WAS TOSSED OUT BY THE

51
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:45,293
ADMINISTRATION AFTER THE SCHOOL

52
00:01:45,293 --> 00:01:46,394
YEAR.

53
00:01:46,394 --> 00:01:48,130
HE EITHER RESIGNS, FOLLOWS THE

54
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,664
LINE OF THE SCHOOL, USING THESE

55
00:01:49,664 --> 00:01:50,665
TRANSGENDER NAMES THAT WERE NOT

56
00:01:50,665 --> 00:01:53,768
AS HE SAID THE BIRTH NAMES OR HE

57
00:01:53,768 --> 00:01:55,770
WILL BE SUSPENDED AND THEN

58
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:56,371
TERMINATED.

59
00:01:56,371 --> 00:01:58,373
THOSE WERE THE CHOICES.

60
00:01:58,373 --> 00:02:00,375
SO FROM THE STANDPOINT OF OUR

61
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:01,977
LEGAL POSITION, WE BELIEVE THAT

62
00:02:01,977 --> 00:02:03,211
WE HAVE AN ILLEGAL DISCHARGE.

63
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:05,147
THAT IS NUMBER ONE.

64
00:02:05,147 --> 00:02:07,415
NUMBER TWO, THE CONSTITUTIONAL

65
00:02:07,415 --> 00:02:09,550
ISSUE IS CAN THE GOVERNMENT

66
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,920
COMPEL HIM TO VIOLATE HIS

67
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,587
RELIGIOUS BELIEFS?

68
00:02:12,587 --> 00:02:14,556
THERE IS SUFFICIENT FEDERAL LAW

69
00:02:14,556 --> 00:02:16,591
THAT SAYS THAT THEY MUST MAKE A

70
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:18,393
REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION IF HE

71
00:02:18,393 --> 00:02:19,027
HAS RELIGIOUS BELIEFS.

72
00:02:19,027 --> 00:02:21,964
IN THOSE CASES THEY ARE WELL

73
00:02:21,964 --> 00:02:22,965
ESTABLISHED AROUND THE COUNTRY.

74
00:02:22,965 --> 00:02:25,767
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A NEW

75
00:02:25,767 --> 00:02:28,971
ONE, BECAUSE IT DEALS WITH AN

76
00:02:28,971 --> 00:02:29,571
INSIDIOUS EFFORT BY A

77
00:02:29,571 --> 00:02:32,374
GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY, IF YOU

78
00:02:32,374 --> 00:02:34,510
WILL, A SCHOOL PAID BY TAXPAYER

79
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:34,977
FUNDS.

80
00:02:34,977 --> 00:02:36,378
SO WE SEE THIS AS A DIFFERENT

81
00:02:36,378 --> 00:02:37,880
WRINKLE THAT WE HAVE SEEN BEFORE

82
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,382
IN THE CASES COMING UP.

83
00:02:40,382 --> 00:02:41,950
>> Laura: I THINK THAT THE

84
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,020
STUDIES ON TRANSGENDER IS HIM

85
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,988
ARE VERY DIFFICULT.

86
00:02:45,988 --> 00:02:50,959
FIRST OF ALL, THERE IS NO REAL

87
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,795
LONG PEER-REVIEWED STUDY THAT WE

88
00:02:52,795 --> 00:02:54,196
CAN LOOK AT ADS WITH WHETHER

89
00:02:54,196 --> 00:02:55,564
HORMONE BLOCKERS, WE DO NOT NEED

90
00:02:55,564 --> 00:02:57,032
TO GET INTO THAT, IT IS NOT

91
00:02:57,032 --> 00:02:57,399
RELEVANT.

92
00:02:57,399 --> 00:03:00,703
BUT THERE IS A REALLY EXPLOSIVE

93
00:03:00,703 --> 00:03:03,739
GROWTH IN KIDS CALLING

94
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:06,375
THEMSELVES TRANSGENDER.

95
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:07,443
AND JUST IN THE BRITISH STUDY,

96
00:03:07,443 --> 00:03:12,581
THEY WENT FROM I THINK IT IS 94

97
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:13,949
REFERRALS AS GENDER DYSPHORIA,

98
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:16,786
THE TECHNICAL TERM FROM

99
00:03:16,786 --> 00:03:17,186
2009-2010.

100
00:03:17,186 --> 00:03:21,190
94 AT THE CLINIC TO NOW BETWEEN

101
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,961
2016-2171986 REFERRALS INCLUDING

102
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:28,197
SOME OF THOSE WHERE CHILDREN ARE

103
00:03:28,197 --> 00:03:31,167
YOUNGER THAN SIX YEARS OF AGE.

104
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:32,568
PEOPLE ARE THINKING THAT THIS

105
00:03:32,568 --> 00:03:34,804
COULD BE GENDER AFFIRMING

106
00:03:34,804 --> 00:03:37,773
TREATMENTS AND ACTUALLY

107
00:03:37,773 --> 00:03:38,774
ENCOURAGING KIDS WHO CALL

108
00:03:38,774 --> 00:03:40,176
THEMSELVES TRANSGENDER, MOST

109
00:03:40,176 --> 00:03:40,643
GROW OUT OF IT.

110
00:03:40,643 --> 00:03:42,011
THAT IS THE WAY THAT IT IS.

111
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:45,348
BUT OTHER STUDIES, ADOLESCENT

112
00:03:45,348 --> 00:03:46,949
HEALTH JOURNAL SAYING THAT THEY

113
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:48,785
ARE TWO TO THREE MORE TIMES

114
00:03:48,785 --> 00:03:50,987
LIKELY TO SUFFER FROM

115
00:03:50,987 --> 00:03:52,054
DEPRESSION, SUICIDE, OTHER

116
00:03:52,054 --> 00:03:54,090
MENTAL DISORDERS, VERY DIFFICULT

117
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:54,924
MENTAL DISORDERS, VERY DIFFICUL

118
00:03:54,924 --> 00:03:55,291
DIFFICULT.

119
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,794
SO ARE YOU ACTING IN PART OUT OF

120
00:03:57,794 --> 00:03:58,528
CONCERN FOR THESE KIDS THINKING

121
00:03:58,528 --> 00:04:02,131
THAT THEY ARE GETTING BAD ADVICE

122
00:04:02,131 --> 00:04:04,967
FROM THEIR PARENTS OR OTHERS?

123
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:07,570
>> I DO REALLY CARE ABOUT THESE

124
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,339
STUDENTS, THAT IS WHY I WANTED

125
00:04:10,339 --> 00:04:11,040
TO SIDESTEP THE WHOLE ISSUE.

126
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,475
I WANTED TO FOCUS ON TEACHING

127
00:04:12,475 --> 00:04:14,977
THE KIDS ORCHESTRA AND BEING

128
00:04:14,977 --> 00:04:16,144
ABLE TO REACH OUT TO THEM.

129
00:04:16,144 --> 00:04:19,148
AND I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OVER THE

130
00:04:19,148 --> 00:04:19,982
COURSE OF THE YEAR CULTIVATE

131
00:04:19,982 --> 00:04:22,952
FRIENDLY RELATIONSHIPS WITH MY

132
00:04:22,952 --> 00:04:23,519
STUDENTS INCLUDING THE

133
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,253
TRANSGENDER STUDENTS OF MINE.

134
00:04:24,253 --> 00:04:25,655
AND I REALLY WANT TO CONTINUE

135
00:04:25,655 --> 00:04:27,423
TEACHING THEIR PET I LOVE THESE

136
00:04:27,423 --> 00:04:30,160
KIDS AND I WANT TO CONTINUE THAT

137
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,460
WORK.

138
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,461
>> Laura: JOHN, WHAT WAS THE

139
00:04:31,461 --> 00:04:33,463
REACTION FROM THE OTHER

140
00:04:33,463 --> 00:04:33,963
STUDENTS?

141
00:04:33,963 --> 00:04:35,565
THEY MUST HAVE HEARD ABOUT THIS.

142
00:04:35,565 --> 00:04:39,435
WHAT GRADE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT

143
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:41,171
>> 9-12.

144
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:43,173
>> Laura: WHAT WAS THE

145
00:04:43,173 --> 00:04:43,907
REACTION OF THE OTHER STUDENTS

146
00:04:43,907 --> 00:04:44,641
WHEN THEY CHANGE NAMES AT THE

147
00:04:44,641 --> 00:04:47,911
MIDDLE OF THE TERM?

148
00:04:47,911 --> 00:04:51,548
>> IN MY CLASS, BECAUSE I HAD

149
00:04:51,548 --> 00:04:52,749
BEEN REFERRING TO STUDENTS BY

150
00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:54,584
THEIR LAST NAME ONLY, IT HAS NOT

151
00:04:54,584 --> 00:04:56,186
REALLY BEEN A TOPIC THAT HAS

152
00:04:56,186 --> 00:04:57,720
BEEN DISCUSSED.

153
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,922
WE FOCUSED ON WORKING TOGETHER

154
00:04:58,922 --> 00:05:00,156
AS A TEAM TO CREATE BEAUTIFUL

155
00:05:00,156 --> 00:05:00,490
MUSIC.

156
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,325
I THINK THAT I'VE BEEN

157
00:05:02,325 --> 00:05:03,526
SUCCESSFUL IN BEING ABLE TO

158
00:05:03,526 --> 00:05:05,962
CREATE A CULTURE AND MY

159
00:05:05,962 --> 00:05:06,563
CLASSROOM THAT THEY ARE

160
00:05:06,563 --> 00:05:08,064
RESPECTING EACH OTHER AND I

161
00:05:08,064 --> 00:05:08,531
EXPECT THEM TO.

162
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:10,700
AND I CARED FOR THEM AND DO

163
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,170
RESPECT THEM ALL.

164
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:17,941
>> Laura: AND THE SUIT BEING

165
00:05:17,941 --> 00:05:18,775
FILED IN FEDERAL COURT?

166
00:05:18,775 --> 00:05:21,978
>> WE HOPE NOT, WE HOPE THAT THE

167
00:05:21,978 --> 00:05:24,848
SCHOOL BOARD AT 6:30 ON MONDAY,

168
00:05:24,848 --> 00:05:26,883
RECANTS, ALLIANCE OF FREEDOM

169
00:05:26,883 --> 00:05:29,085
BROUGHT ME INTO THIS TO TRY TO

170
00:05:29,085 --> 00:05:32,155
AVOID LITIGATION IF WE CAN GET

171
00:05:32,155 --> 00:05:33,790
IT HANDLED, THAT'S WHAT JOHN

172
00:05:33,790 --> 00:00:00,000
WANTS AND WHAT WE WANT.
