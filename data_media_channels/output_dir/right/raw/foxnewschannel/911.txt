101
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26,084
UNBELIEVABLE.

102
00:02:26,084 --> 00:02:27,652

00:02:37,195 --> 00:02:37,562
DIRECTION.

110
00:02:37,562 --> 00:02:38,363

112
00:02:39,764 --> 00:02:40,799
OF THE MEDIA WITH THE FBI.

113
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:41,733
WHAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL

00:02:50,942 --> 00:02:51,543
NOW, THERE IS SOME

121
00:02:51,543 --> 00:02:52,210
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THEY

135
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:12,230
BECAUSE THEY ALL HAVE THE

136
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:15,100

00:04:40,985 --> 00:04:42,253
FIX THIS AND WE ARE GOING TO

196
00:04:42,253 --> 00:04:43,088
HAVE VERY SIGNIFICANT

197
00:04:43,088 --> 00:04:44,456
TRAINING OF ALL OF OUR

198
00:04:44,456 --> 00:04:46,191
AGENTS, NEW AGENTS, SENIOR

199
00:04:46,191 --> 00:04:47,225
AGENTS, ALL THOUSANDS OF

200
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:48,493
AGENTS THAT THEY NEED TO BE

201
00:04:48,493 --> 00:04:50,929
UNBIASED IN THEIR

202
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:51,362
INVESTIGATION.

203
00:04:51,362 --> 00:04:52,697
AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF THEY

204
00:04:52,697 --> 00:04:55,133
ARE UNBIASED IN THEIR

205
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:55,567
INVESTIGATION.

206
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:56,735
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE FBI

207
00:04:56,735 --> 00:04:57,702
SUN BIASED IN

208
00:04:57,702 --> 00:04:58,169
INVESTIGATIONS.

209
00:04:58,169 --> 00:04:59,104
WHY ARE YOU TRASHING YOUR

210
00:04:59,104 --> 00:05:01,272
OWN AGENCY?

211
00:05:01,272 --> 00:05:03,241
THE PROBLEM ISN'T JOE FBI

212
00:05:03,241 --> 00:05:05,210
AGENT OR SALLY FBI AGENT.

213
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:08,747
THE PROBLEM IS JIM COMEY.

214
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,348
THE PROBLEM IS STRZOK.

215
00:05:10,348 --> 00:05:12,617
THE PROBLEM IS PAGE.

216
00:05:12,617 --> 00:05:14,552
THE PROBLEM IS THEIR OWN

217
00:05:14,552 --> 00:05:14,953
CROWD.

218
00:05:14,953 --> 00:05:18,456
I FOUND IT INCREDIT DIB

219
00:05:18,456 --> 00:05:19,724
BAILIFF OUTRAGEOUS OF THE

220
00:05:19,724 --> 00:05:20,892
FBI DIRECTOR.

221
00:05:20,892 --> 00:05:23,061
I HAPPEN TO KNOW IT IS.

222
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:24,429
ON THE OTHER HAND, EVERYBODY

223
00:05:24,429 --> 00:05:25,430
NEEDS TO BE TRAINED NOT TO

224
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,297
BE BIASED?

225
00:05:26,297 --> 00:05:28,967
THIS REPORT, EVEN THOUGH THE

226
00:05:28,967 --> 00:05:30,301
IG SAYS HE DIDN'T FIND

227
00:05:30,301 --> 00:05:31,536
POLITICAL BIAS, I HAVE TO

228
00:05:31,536 --> 00:05:32,437
SAY THERE IS BIAS THROUGHOUT

229
00:05:32,437 --> 00:05:36,808
AND HE USES THE WORD

230
00:05:36,808 --> 00:05:38,977
THROUGHOUT BUT I WOULD ASK

231
00:05:38,977 --> 00:05:39,644
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL WHAT

232
00:05:39,644 --> 00:05:41,346
KIND OF BIAS ARE YOU TALKING

233
00:05:41,346 --> 00:05:42,947
ABOUT SEXUAL BIAS; RELIGIOUS

234
00:05:42,947 --> 00:05:43,248
BIAS?

235
00:05:43,248 --> 00:05:44,215
OF COURSE IT WAS POLITICAL

236
00:05:44,215 --> 00:05:44,516
BIAS.

237
00:05:44,516 --> 00:05:45,784
AS STARTED OUT BY SAYING

238
00:05:45,784 --> 00:05:47,385
THERE IS NOT A SINGLE

239
00:05:47,385 --> 00:05:48,520
PRO-TRUMP TEXT FROM ANY OF

240
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,254
THESE FBI AGENTS.

241
00:05:49,254 --> 00:05:50,822
THERE IS NOT A SINGLE

242
00:05:50,822 --> 00:05:52,957
PRO-TRUMP FBI AGENT.

243
00:05:52,957 --> 00:05:54,292
THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE

244
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:54,659
OBJECTIVE.

245
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:55,693
THEY HAVE POLITICIZED IT TO

246
00:05:55,693 --> 00:05:58,296
SUCH AN EXTENT AND THE

247
00:05:58,296 --> 00:05:59,597
REASON, THE REASON IS AS I

248
00:05:59,597 --> 00:06:00,732
SAID THEY HAD TO PROTECT

249
00:06:00,732 --> 00:06:01,399
HILLARY CLINTON BECAUSE SHE

250
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,500
WOULD HAVE AND SHOULD HAVE

251
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,334
BEEN INDICTED.

252
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:04,936
SO, HILLARY, I SAW YOUR

253
00:06:04,936 --> 00:06:06,304
LITTLE TWEET TODAY, KIND OF

254
00:06:06,304 --> 00:06:08,540
THINKING WELL, SIGH, EVEN

255
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,275
COMEY USED HIS PERSONAL

256
00:06:10,275 --> 00:06:11,075
EMAIL FOR GOVERNMENT

257
00:06:11,075 --> 00:06:13,511
BUSINESS BUT HILLARY YOU

258
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,313
VIOLATED THE ESPIONAGE ACT

259
00:06:15,313 --> 00:06:16,614
AND JIM COMEY PROTECTED YOU,

260
00:06:16,614 --> 00:06:18,516
YOU COULD VERY WELL BE IN AN

261
00:06:18,516 --> 00:06:19,617
ORANGE JUMPSUIT TODAY AND

262
00:06:19,617 --> 00:06:21,052
I'M QUITE, QUITE SERIOUS

263
00:06:21,052 --> 00:06:22,187
THAT YOU AREN'T AND YOU

264
00:06:22,187 --> 00:06:24,889
SHOULD THANK GOD FOR THAT.

265
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:27,592
>> Sean: GREAT ONE, MARK

266
00:06:27,592 --> 00:06:27,926
LEVIN.

267
00:06:27,926 --> 00:06:29,828
BY THE WAY I HAVE A MUTUAL

268
00:06:29,828 --> 00:06:31,496
FROM A KNEW ACTUAL FRIEND

269
00:06:31,496 --> 00:06:33,865
BILLY SAYS WOW TELL MARK

270
00:06:33,865 --> 00:00:00,000
