12
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:24,925
THAT SOUNDS INSINCERE BUT IT'S

NOT, IT'S SINCERE.

WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

20
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:36,370
WHO THE PRESIDENT WAS.

21
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,739
SO FOR THE LAST YEAR WE HAVE

22
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:39,740
CONSISTENTLY HELD BACK.

23
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,742
EVEN AS OMINOUS SIGNS

24
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:43,543
ACCUMULATED, WE STRUGGLED

25
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,112
AGAINST CALLING THE MUELLER

29
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:49,016
WE DIDN'T WANT TO THINK THAT IT

30
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:49,282
WAS.

31
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:49,950
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S GETTING

32
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,085
HARDER TO DENY THAT NOW.

33
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:52,819
AS FEDERAL JUDGE T.S. ELIOT PUT

34
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:55,756
IT LAST WEEK, MUELLER IS SEEKING

35
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:58,759
ONLY INFORMATION THAT WOULD

36
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:01,028
REFLECT ON MR. TRUMP OR LEAD

37
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:01,928
WITH POSSIBLE IMPEACHMENT.

00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:04,331
THERE YOU HAVE IT.

39
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:06,767
THAT IS A HIT JOB ON A

40
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:07,934
DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED LEADER.

41
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:08,635
THE LEFT KNOWS THIS AND OF

42
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:10,904
COURSE IT PLEASES THEM.

43
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,140
REMOVING HIM FROM OFFICE IS THE

44
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,908
ONLY PRINCIPAL THEY RECOGNIZE.

45
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,144
BUT INSTEAD OF ADMITTING THAT

46
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:18,979
THEY LECTURE THE REST OF US

47
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:20,580
ENGRAVE TONES ABOUT THE RULE OF

48
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,314
LAW LIKE THEY REALLY CARE WHAT

49
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:21,915
THE CONSTITUTION SAYS.

50
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,985
OF COURSE THEY DON'T.

51
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:25,852
AS THEY POINTED OUT IN A PRETTY

52
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,922
SMART PIECE OVER THE WEEKEND

53
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:29,856
MUELLER WILL HAVE THE POWER TO

54
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,325
TAKE TRUMP OUT.

55
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:33,460
NO INSTITUTION WOULD.

56
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,128
THE ONLY INSTITUTION WITH THE

57
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:36,163
POWER TO PROSECUTE THE PRESIDENT

58
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:37,097
IS THE CONGRESS.

59
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,231
THE PRESIDENCY IS A POLITICAL

60
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:38,565
OFFICE.

61
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:41,334
VOTERS GET TO DECIDE WHO FILLS

62
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:41,902
IT.

63
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:44,938
OTHERS GET TO CHECK THE POWER,

64
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,773
NOT ROGUE FBI AGENTS, NOT PETER

65
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,141
OR LISA PAGE.

66
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:48,675
COULD THE CONGRESS.

67
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,510
IF THE PRESIDENT HAS COMMITTED A

68
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,711
CRIME THE CONGRESS CAN PUT HIM

69
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:52,679
ON CRIME, THAT'S CALLED

70
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:53,146
IMPEACHMENT.

71
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:53,814
THEY COULD DO IT TOMORROW IF

72
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:56,349
THEY WANTED.

73
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:57,184
IT'S IN THE CONSTITUTION.

74
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:58,385
IMPEACHMENT, THIS IS THE BEST

75
00:01:58,385 --> 00:01:59,619
PART, TAKES PLACE OPENLY IN

76
00:01:59,619 --> 00:01:59,953
PUBLIC.

77
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,756
THE REST OF US CAN WATCH IT AND

78
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:04,758
EVALUATED EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

79
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:06,760
THERE ARE NO REDACTED DOCUMENTS

80
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,128
OR LEAKED TEXT MESSAGES FROM

81
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:09,930
CREEPY FBI AGENTS.

82
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,131
THE WHOLE THING IS TRANSPARENT

83
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,732
AND THAT'S HOW DEMOCRACIES ARE

84
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:17,404
SUPPOSED TO OPERATE, OPENLY.

85
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:18,905
UNDERSTANDS THIS IS THE

86
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:19,539
DEMOCRATIC BASE.

87
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,941
AMAZING, BUT IT'S TRUE.

88
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,742
THEY BADLY WANT TO IMPEACH

89
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:24,344
DONALD TRUMP, AND THEY SAY SO.

90
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,178
THEIR LEADERS LIE ABOUT IT AND

91
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:25,979
THEY DO IT FOR THE SAME REASON

92
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,148
THEY LIE ABOUT EVERYTHING,

93
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,349
BECAUSE ALL THEY CARE ABOUT

94
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:29,816
REALLY IS POWER.

95
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,751
THEY DON'T WANT TO SCARE VOTERS

96
00:02:31,751 --> 00:00:00,000
BEFORE THE MIDTERM ELECTION SO
