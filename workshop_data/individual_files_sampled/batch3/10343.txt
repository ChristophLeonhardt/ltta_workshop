it's a bad really bad situation there's the tragedy 15 people dead - friendly fire then there's the fallout everyone's blaming everyone he Jets deliberately created a dangerous situation for the warships and aircraft located in that area while it may have been a Syrian missile that down the plane it was Israel that set the stage says Russia Israel bombed Syria again the Syrians defend themselves and the Russian jet gets caught in the crossfire the Israeli military though blames Iran and Hezbollah Israel holds their sad regime whose military shut down the Russian plane fully responsible for this incident it was their fault Israel had to bomb Syria you see Iran was transferring lethal technology to Hezbollah via the Syrian military apparently so Israel had to stop them the Syrians panicked and started launching anti-air missiles everywhere Israel is blameless says Israel as for the United States can you comment at all on the the shoot down of the Russian jet yesterday and whether or not you us had any visibility in it over a deconfliction line or any other means as far as it attracted terror we did not the coalition was not involved with this did you have any visibility into it as it was happening through either your own radar or through the deconfliction line we did not that I'm tracking I didn't see what happened usually what one doesn't see what happened one doesn't blame anyone unless one can get in a cheap shot against Iran I would like to express sorrow to our Council partners Russia for the tragic loss of life when the Russian plane was downed yesterday if Russia is interested in bringing peace to Syria it should make sure Iran in its militias leave Syria once and for all the risk of a broader conflict will leave with them Iran is responsible for creating the Syria we see today it's an interesting argument Israel's been bombing Syria near enough monthly sometimes weekly in order to prevent Iran from launching an attack on Israel to date there have been zero Iranian attacks and a whole lot of Israeli ones we condemn this new act of Israeli aggression against my country the UN Security Council must bring Israel to account for its violation of international law Israel attacked Syria twice this week but apparently some are unaware of that strange isn't that how selective people are about international law and bombing but others are seeing this as a warning a wake-up call the risks of conflicts escalation a huge the risk of miscalculation a misunderstanding that led to the downing of a Russian aircraft and cap slates on a small scale the much bigger and even more frightening risk of a wider miscalculation we call upon all parties especially when we are getting this type of positive news regarding what could have been a dramatic military escalation to refrain from military actions elsewhere Israel has expressed its condolences even offered to send the head of its Air Force to Russia to report on the incident Putin's urging calm saying this was a tragic fluke struck a certain Western Australia knows this situation is different from the one when a Turkish jet shot down our plane back then Turkey intentionally shot down the aircraft but now it looks like a chain of accidental events fortunately it appears a military escalation has been prevented verbal one is in full swing of course but there's a lesson here five nuclear powers of fighting in Syria on different sides and the tiniest spark there could cause the biggest inferno the world's ever seen you
