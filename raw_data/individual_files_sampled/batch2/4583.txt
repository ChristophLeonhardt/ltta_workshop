I obviously with my know your value platform feel really strongly about these comments and they made my blood boil I was shaking when I heard them alisz Jordan Walter Isaacson next to me they both were shaken Willy Joe and I are going to do a really kind of major debrief on the entire thing on the know your value website because it goes down to value here he is undermining a woman's credibility because he says look at her yeah and laughs derisively what a pig and then talks about looking at Donald Trump's wives what a pig and this is a guy who ran pageants Donald Trump for his living okay so we're not even going in back room during teen pageants so he could watch those girls disrobe I'm not a fan of pageants but I'm not gonna judge someone doing pageants for a living and you know that's the Miss America pageant is making great progress so there's a lot to talk about there but my point is beyond the hypocrisy this is a really bad day for women if this is exactly the person the president wants speaking for him telling people to look at someone and then laughing derisively and it's a woman talking about she's not credible cause look at her and then and then and then comparing her to the president's wives this is not the America that you and I have been trying to pave the way for women for we have a long way to go for women knowing their value the president and his attorney have taken us back like decades it's a bad day for Humanity imagine if you are not magic that any of us sat here and said look at those crazy old men right look at those crazy old cigar-smoking wacky men spouting their mouths spouting lies I mean they would say that we're in appropriate we're ages how is it in 2018 Rudy Giuliani can say this and you don't have an immediate apology from the White House how doesn't Ivanka Trump stand up and say I'm making my way back to New York this is too shameful well look and remember let's not forget Rudy Giuliani a man spouting absurdities about how type of women he values and doesn't value which is so offensive and weakest ed it's so correctly he's a man who divorced his wife on television she found out Donna Hanover that she was getting divorced when he announced it at a press conference what kind of family values are those he's the least qualified to talk about who is a person or a parent of value and you know as it goes for Ivanka I mean she you know really made representations that she was going to be a champion of women a champion of the LGBTQ community she has been nothing but a hypocrite and a coward she cowards in the White House and doesn't say anything when issues come up that clearly deserve her response in her voice what I wonder Donald Trump appeared in a softcore pornography movie himself called centerfolds I want to say in the early 2000s so Michael it's sort of stunning that suddenly Rudy Giuliani has found some sort of I'm not even going to say religion some sort of faux highbrow Family Values nonsense Donald Trump has had over a dozen women who have posed in Playboy and I'm not judging it on the apprentice he met stormy Daniels at a Trump golf event he didn't think she was too low in for him then so what do you do do you try to file a defamation suit against mr. Giuliani well we haven't decided what we're going to do Stephanie but I couldn't agree with your comments more you know it's it's the hypocrisy of this president as it relates to women and and that is really astounding to have mr. Giuliani criticize my client for how she looks and what she has done for a living and basically tie that to her credibility and claim that she's not doing in respect is ridiculous especially when you look at and I want to be really clear with what I'm about to say you know the first lady of the United States when she came to the United States she engaged in modeling some of those pictures show her scantily clad you know they're beautiful photographs by the way no one judges her based on those pictures no one judges her based on how she looks relating to her credibility or respect if anyone were to do that the white house would be clamoring they would demanding an absolute apology and that there'd be repercussions for that and rightfully so we're demanding the same Giuliani should be fired immediately not next hour not tomorrow not next week right now this cannot be permitted to stand and then the last thing I'm gonna say is mr. Giuliani wants to talk about daughters well let me tell you something I have two young amazing daughters and regardless of what profession they may pick and regardless of what they look like ultimately if anyone were to ever make these remarks about them as women I'd absolutely knock them out hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
