Hilary Clinton made an appearance at the Grammys and it was as cringe-worthy as you might expect Hillary Clinton or as my good friend Kirk Schlichter calls her felonio von pantsuit made an appearance at the Grammys last night now you've probably seen it by now look I don't watch award shows as a rule I don't want to watch a bunch of mega rich leftist elites pat themselves on the back because they're nannies agents and managers Auto Tunes producers editors songwriters background musicians background singers valets personal assistants did something that they're getting the credit for so I don't watch award shows for that reason I always love it when a celebrity gets mother of the Year award dad of the Year award yeah it's really hard to be mom of the year with 14 nannies a fleet of SUVs and three personal assistants taking your kids clothes and food shopping yeah really tough mom you've got it really really tough that single mom on the bus stop going her a second job she's really really happy you got that award especially when it's pouring and she forgot her umbrella she's so happy you got that award yeah if you get on your private jet when she's struggling to take her kids to for ice cream let alone Disney World so give yourself some more Pat's on the back Hollywood music industry do you guys deserve it you're the real hero you're the really but they embarrassed themselves even further because look Hillary Clinton this woman could be somewhat dignified you would expect it but she's not the Clintons are not dignified people the Clintons are people who are or were really just white trash in the White House they've always been they've never cared about the rule of law they've never cared about insulting the American public they've never cared about disgracing our nation committing crimes they're there they are literally the Clintons are the not the me to hashtag me to generation the Clintons personify hashtag what's in it for me they certainly do now look we've watched this election while the 2016 election be be rigged in favor of Hillary Clinton to the point we've never watched any other election every day but actually I'm wrong it's I was gonna say every hour but it's not every hour it's every minute a new story is popping up about Miss doing misdeeds about wrongdoing inside Department of Justice FBI the intelligence community the Obama White House Camp Hillary the PACs associated with her on behalf of Hillary Clinton fusion GPS the list goes on piece of information upon piece of information about just how bad and just have dirty the dealings weren't we saw what Hillary did to Bernie Sanders in the primary working with debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC to rig the primary against Sanders now if you don't know and I won't get too into the weeds political parties are not supposed to and not supposed to pick sides in primaries at the most local level up to the federal level so local county democratic parties aren't supposed to take sides and date and local primaries and the DNC the Democratic National Committee is not supposed to take sides in the primary for the presidential race they're just not supposed to do it nor are the Republicans but they did it they did it and they admitted it loudly and proudly and debbie Wasserman Schultz essentially said hey we're a private organization we did it what are you gonna do about it screw you Bernie so the Clintons have a history of getting away with whatever they want they're never called on anything because the media loves them the media fawns over them hillarie broke the law we all know that hill oka the law I have to say she allegedly broke the law but we all know that hillary broke the law we know that whom Abidine should be in jail whom Aberdeen Hillary's right hand like her daughter her I don't want to go there but but whatever she is to Hillary and there's a lot of speculation on what she is the Hillary but whatever she is to Hillary Huma Abedin knowingly negligently willfully intentionally assigned whatever level of culpability you want put classified emails on her husband's laptop a guy who was not cleared to see them a guy who was a convicted pedophile a guy who's gonna go serve two years in prison he was holding classified information on his laptop presumably but that other people couldn't see it or that Huma had her own insurance policy that's yet to be seen nothing was done nothing was done we've got the President of the United States now facing an obstruction of justice investigation or fighting back against crimes that never happened think about this Robert Muller is pulling people into perjury traps over crimes that he knows never happened I can't think of a worse perversion of our justice system know what Robert Muller is doing in fact I'm gonna go as far as to say that as an investigator on the outside looking in at the Muller investigation I think Muller has gone from unethical potentially criminal himself using his investigation his sham of an investigation to obstruct install an investigation into the collusion between the US government and Team Hillary during the election the collusion between the US government the FBI the DOJ the intelligence community and team Hillary during the election Muller sham is blocking and stalling that valid investigation so want to talk about obstruction of justice let's look at robert muller first but this isn't about him this is about hillary now we've got hillary clinton who's constantly popping up like Bigfoot and get these grainy photos of her walking through the Chappaqua woods like that you know the old bigfoot but you don't really know if it's Bigfoot but it's hillary and like a quilted coat I was gonna make a joke about putting an antler hat on her but I'm not gonna go there it's not nice he's somebody's grandmother hmm and who knows how many others kids bill doesn't know about but that's another show entirely but don't look you got Hillary Clinton walking around the woods and then when she's not walking around the woods meandering around like granny dementia she pops out and says silly things like this is for my feminists bitches or has to jab the president all culminating in her showing up at the Grammy Awards now we don't want politics infused into pop culture the NFL should have learned that lesson this season you know I'm down here in South Florida and many bars and many areas have Florida blue but many others are very red and many bars are opting not to show the Super Bowl because of the politics three of them that I've driven past have said with respect to our troops who are police to our first responders to our president to the country were not gonna broadcast a Super Bowl this year they're kissing off thousands of dollars because they're just so fed up think about that you're a bar owner Super Bowl Sunday is one of the biggest days of the year and I'm driven by three that are not gonna show the game because of the disrespect NFL players have shown to our president our nation our troops are first responders or cops or firefighters our flag and Hillary Clinton plays in all that but she shows up at the Grammys reading excerpts from Michael Wolf's moronic book and and the skit was the Grammy performers celebrities were auditioning for the audiobook and it ends with Hillary and predictably the audience goes wild and and and it's the greatest thing they've ever seen and she's amazing and that she probably hosted her after-party that consisted of insurer virgin martinis and Murder She Wrote playing on the video wall on a loop and they loved it and they fawned over her and told her I was the greatest after party had ever been to and how Hillary Clinton is the greatest thing since sliced bread and now what's worse here is that CBS aired this CBS which purports to be an objective network an objective journalism outlet with CBS News which we know it isn't they tried to smear Bush 43 president george w bush with those bogus dan Rather memos they tried to well when Ben Rhodes Obama's national security or on his national security beta twink worked for the Obama administration Ben Rhodes his brother was the president of CBS News Ben Rhodes is hysterical on social media because of the TEL storm that is about to collapse the Democrats house of cards the CBS is not an objective outlet they didn't disclaim Hillary's comments they didn't disclaim the celebrities comments against the president no they presented it as objective hard news so my question is why do outlets like CBS CNN the Washington Post a New York Times MSNBC why do they continue to get unfettered press creds for the White House to Congress while outlets like the rebel have to constantly request them I'm gonna go out there and say it I've set a theme before our editorial standards I'm much higher than they're we're not allowed to use anonymous sources I can mention on-air to you my managing editors are tough here I can say look I spoke to some sources in law enforcement and this is what they're telling me take it with a grain of salt but they're people in the know but they won't let me my editors here will not let me bring you a story solely based on anonymous sources I can bring you a story on hard news that Muller did a B C and D and then I followed up spoke to some retired FBI agents and this these are their personal opinions on Robert Muller that they'll let me do but they never let me turn around and say to you well Adam Schiff said this on the record Democrat Adam Schiff my anonymous source is retired FBI contradicted him go with that the rebel would never let me do that but CNN CBS The Washington Post the New York Times they do that every single day enter a story last week about ambassador to the UN US ambassador to the UN nikki Haley having an affair with President Trump that happened mostly on Air Force One while nikki Haley is no Wallflower nikki Haley came back with both barrels blazing that this is absolute nonsense I've been on Air Force One one time and the presence of many people she said in fact I've never been alone with the President of the United States even when he was talking to her about being confirmed or or being selected and then confirmed as ambassador to the UN there were always multiple people around them his staff her staff he's never been alone with the president he's been on Air Force one one time yet the fake news media ran with stories about an affair between her and the president and I bring up Nikki hailey because she pushed back pretty hard on Hilary's embarrassment at the Grammys Nikki hailey I'm gonna read you her tweet she said I've always loved the Grammys but they have artists read the fire and fury book killed it don't ruin great music with trash some of us love the music without the politics thrown in it and she's right and that's why Hollywood is suffering movie sales are down now look we movie movie ticket sales are down and it's for a lot of reasons write paper whoo I don't go to movies because I just hate people around me eating their popcorn and then look but no buts flapping their lips texting and talking on their cell phones people have gotten very rude well I don't go to movies the only movies I go to were those ones where you pay extra money and you get the big lounge here and they bring you food and they bring you booze because that's a bit more enjoyable that much enjoyable of an experience or I will go to IMAX for things like movies like Dunkirk which I saw in IMAX which I thought was phenomenal and you did see it in IMAX but barring those you know rare instances I don't go to movie so I get my movie ticket sales are down it's also a pay-per-view makes it very easy and now with them releasing these movies earlier and Charlie up charging you a premium fee I'd much rather do that than go to the movies it's cheaper anyway all-in but but the entertainment industry has lost us because they they don't understand that more than half of this nation is not radically far left more than half of the viewers of the Grammys last night didn't want to see Hillary Clinton mocking the President of the United States they didn't want to see it the people that wanted to see it for the elite DC LA New York City bubble echo chambers the rest of the nation is rolling their eyes and Hillary Clinton should know better the woman should have a little bit of dignity and go away quietly you should just go away quietly in a retirement give her a quarter million dollar a pop speeches he'd care of her grandchild but no she's hell-bent on power and she's hell-bent on on returning a job that was never hers in the first place the presidency was never hers for the asking it's the American people's to give Hillary thought she was entitled to it not that she had a earn the trust the respect and most importantly the vote of the American people but even worse or whoever produces the Grammys because now they've taken the Grammys from sex drugs and rock and roll with dementia a purse full of hard candies and regret if you like this content please subscribe to our
