TO HEAL FROM THE IMPACTS OF

44
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:12,850
RACISM.

45
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,420
>> Tucker: IT'S A LITTLE AT

46
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,122
PATRONIZING THOUGH NO IN THE

47
00:01:18,122 --> 00:01:19,891
ASSUMPTION ALL BLACK PEOPLE

48
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:22,393
ARE POOR AND NEED THE HELP

49
00:01:22,393 --> 00:01:23,027
THE WHITE PEOPLE.

50
00:01:23,027 --> 00:01:25,396
AND IT IT MAKES THE WHITE

51
00:01:25,396 --> 00:01:26,597
PEOPLE FEEL VIRTUOUS LIKE

52
00:01:26,597 --> 00:01:27,765
THEY ARE COMING TO THE

53
00:01:27,765 --> 00:01:28,599
RESCUE AND I DON'T KNOW HOW

54
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:30,101
IT MAKES THE BLACK PEOPLE

55
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:30,401
FEEL.

56
00:01:30,401 --> 00:01:32,036
BUT IT PROBABLY MAKES SOME

57
00:01:32,036 --> 00:01:34,272
OF THEM FEEL PATRONIZED, I

58
00:01:34,272 --> 00:01:34,839
WOULD THINK.

59
00:01:34,839 --> 00:01:35,907
>> THANK YOU, TUCKER.

60
00:01:35,907 --> 00:01:38,176
I SAW YOUR SHOW ABOUT

61
00:01:38,176 --> 00:01:39,744
RACISM, ROSEANNE BAR WE BOTH

62
00:01:39,744 --> 00:01:40,812
AGREE THAT RACISM IS REAL.

63
00:01:40,812 --> 00:01:42,180
WE BOTH AGREE THAT RACISM

64
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,214
GOES TWO BASE.

65
00:01:43,214 --> 00:01:44,715
AND WHAT WE ARE SAY

66
00:01:44,715 --> 00:01:46,884
SOMETHING THAT RACIAL

67
00:01:46,884 --> 00:01:47,852
DISPARITIES, IF YOU LOOK AT

68
00:01:47,852 --> 00:01:49,053
OUR COUNTRY, THE COLOR OF

69
00:01:49,053 --> 00:01:50,154
YOUR SKIN IS A PREDICTOR OF

70
00:01:50,154 --> 00:01:51,756
HOW LONG YOU WILL LIVE, WHAT

71
00:01:51,756 --> 00:01:52,557
KIND OF ECONOMIC LEVEL YOU

72
00:01:52,557 --> 00:01:54,392
WILL BE IN AND OTHER

73
00:01:54,392 --> 00:01:54,725
FACTORS.

74
00:01:54,725 --> 00:01:57,595

00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:01,032
SIMPLE.

79
00:02:01,032 --> 00:02:02,767
BROADLY, MAYBE.

80
00:02:02,767 --> 00:02:03,935
AFRICAN IMMIGRANTS TO THIS

81
00:02:03,935 --> 00:02:05,570

THEY HAVE DIFFERENT

93
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,318

WHY DOESN'T THAT MAKE YOU

102
00:02:31,562 --> 00:02:32,096

WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD

187
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:40,558
