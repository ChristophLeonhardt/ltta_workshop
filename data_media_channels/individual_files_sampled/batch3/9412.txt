D.C. SEWER SWAMP OPENING MONOLOGUE. THE ONE WE WILL GO THROUGH ALL OF THIS VERY, VERY SLOWLY AND PRECISELY, LOTS OF GROUND TO COVER, WITH EVEN BREAKING NEWS ON THE LAST 2 MINUTES. TOMORROW MORNING WE WILL FINALLY GET A CHANCE TO WITNESS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT HEARINGS IN HISTORY OF SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS. AS I'VE SAID MANY TIMES, THE 36-YEAR-OLD ALLEGATION SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. AND IT HAS BEEN BY REPUBLICANS AND THE PRESIDENT. AT 10:00 A.M. AND OPEN HEARINGS THEY WILL LAY IT ALL ON THE TABLE AND IN THE U.S. SENATE THEY WILL MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH. REMEMBER, THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE IS ADVICE AND CONSENT. OF COURSE, THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. 40 YEARS OF ONE'S LIFE IS VERY IMPORTANT. JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN IN THE PUBLIC SPOTLIGHT FOR ALL THESE DECADES AND BECAUSE OF HIS WORK HE IS LITERALLY FACED AND PASSED SIX DEEP BACKGROUND FBI CHECKS. THOSE THAT KNOW KAVANAUGH THE BEST, I SCHOOL FRIENDS IN COLLEGE FRIENDS, THOSE THAT WENT TO LAW SCHOOL, GIRLFRIENDS, COLLEAGUES, FELLOW JUDGES AND CLERKS, THOSE PEOPLE THAT HAVE ALL WORKED WITH HIM, WAS THE COACH WITH BASKETBALL IN OTHER SPORTS, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS, I HAVE PRAISED KAVANAUGH FOR HIS CHARACTER, JUDGMENT AND FRIENDSHIP AND WHO HE IS. THROUGHOUT UNTIL 12 DAYS AGO, ANY ALLEGATION OF ANY SEXUAL MISCONDUCT EVER. JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS HAD ONE OF THE MOST EXTENSIVE TRACK RECORDS OF ANY FEDERAL JUDGE AND HE WORKED ONE OF THE MOST HIGHEST PROFILE FEDERAL COURTS. HE'S BEEN THERE FOR YEARS AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT PROFESSOR FORD AND HER GROPING ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HIM HAVE A LOT OF ISSUES. WE WILL GO STEP-BY-STEP THROUGH EVERY ALLEGATION TONIGHT. THESE CHARGES WERE MADE TO CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS, AND WHILE JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO, NOT AN INDEPENDENT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. BY THE WAY, THE CLAIM DATES BACK TO WHEN FORD AND KAVANAUGH WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL 36 YEARS AGO AND FORD CANNOT REMEMBER A DATE OR LOCATION OF THE ALLEGED INCIDENT. AND THE FOUR WITNESSES THAT FORD LISTED TO CORROBORATE HER CLAIMS, ALL OF THEM DENY WHAT SHE IS ALLEGING AND PROFESSOR FORD HAS REPRESENTED BY AN ATTORNEY WHO POINTED OUT ON THIS SHOW IS A LEFT-WING ACTIVIST WHO ONCE VOWED TO RESIST DONALD TRUMP AT EVERY LEVEL AND HIS INCONSISTENT ON IMPORTANT ISSUES INVOLVING SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE. SHE DIDN'T BELIEVE PAULA JONES OBVIOUSLY, SHE DEFENDED AL FRANKEN. DESPITE ALL OF THESE WARNING SIGNS, IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT PROFESSOR FORD AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH SPEAK UNDER OATH. THE PRESIDENT WOULD MAKE EVERY ACCOMMODATION POSSIBLE AND TONIGHT DEMOCRATS ARE DOING THE EXACT OPPOSITE. THEY HAVE ALREADY CONVICTED JUDGE KAVANAUGH BEFORE EVEN HEARING FROM HIM. OR PROFESSOR FORD. AND RUSHING TO JUDGMENT AGAINST TWO UNCORROBORATED CLAIMS AGAINST KAVANAUGH, ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE SO SALACIOUS WILL LITERALLY TONIGHT MAKE YOUR HEAD SPIN. THE SECOND PLANE THAT CAME OUT IN THE NEW YORKER MAGAZINE WAS SO OUTRAGEOUS AND SO UNSUBSTANTIATED THAT EVEN THE CHILD HATING "NEW YORK TIMES" REFUSED TO OFFICIALLY REPORT ON IT. IN THIS CASE, A WOMAN NAMED DEBORAH RAMIREZ. SHE ALLEGES THAT IN THE 1980s, KAVANAUGH MIGHT HAVE EXPOSED HIMSELF TO HER AT A DRUNKEN COLLEGE PARTY. RAMIREZ HERSELF WASN'T TOTALLY SURE IF IT WAS KAVANAUGH, IF HE WAS THE PERPETRATOR. ACCORDING TO HER OWN WORDS IN HER OWN ACCOUNT SHE BECAME" QUICKLY INEBRIATED" AT THE PARTY. SHE WAS "FOGGY AND SLURRING HER WORDS" AND RAMIREZ EVEN ACKNOWLEDGED THAT SHE HAD SIGNIFICANT MEMORY GAPS FROM THAT EVENING. THOSE RAMIREZ LISTED IN HER CASE TO THE INCIDENT HAVE ALL FLAT FLATLY DENIED HER CHARGE INCLUDING HER OWN BEST FRIENDS. NOT A SINGLE PERSON CORROBORATE HER STORY, NOT ONE. MOMENTS AGO WE LEARNED THERE IS ANOTHER ACCUSER MAKING AN ANONYMOUS HEARSAY CLAIM ABOUT AN INCIDENT THAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN KAVANAUGH AND A WOMAN IN 1998 AND THIS ANONYMOUS NBC NEWS REPORT IS OBVIOUSLY A REPORT THAT I DOUBT NBC NEWS WOULD EVER MAKE ABOUT TOM BROKAW OR MATT LAUER OR AND HE LACKED. THEY WOULDN'T DO IT ABOUT PEOPLE THAT THEY'VE WORKED WITH OR HAVE WORKED WITH OVER THE YEARS. SO THE QUESTION IS, I WAS JUDGE KAVANAUGH SUPPOSED TO DEFEND HIMSELF NOW FROM AN ANONYMOUS ACCUSER AT THE 11TH HOUR? WHICH NOW BRINGS US TO THE SINGLE MOST SICKENING ALLEGATION THAT THE LEFT WANTS YOU TO BELIEVE AS ABSOLUTE FACT. IT WAS BROUGHT INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN BY YOU KNOW HIM, HE'S ON FAKE NEWS CNN EVERY HOUR ON THE HOUR AND IF HE IS NOT THERE HE'S OVER ON CONSPIRACY TV AND NBC. MICHAEL AVENATTI, THE BOMBASTIC, UNTRUSTWORTHY AND FAME SEEKING ATTORNEY WHO MADE IT HIS LIFE'S MISSION TO RESIST AND HATE DONALD TRUMP, WHICH IS FINE. HIS CLIENT IN THIS CASE IS A WOMAN NAMED JULIE SWETNICK. AT THIS LATE HOUR SHE IS ALLEGING THAT BETWEEN 1981 AND 1983, SHE ATTENDED AT LEAST TEN PARTIES, WHERE SHE CLAIMS THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND HIS FRIEND MARK JUDGE ROUTINELY DRUG TO FEMALE PARTYGOERS. THIS HAPPENED REGULARLY, ALMOST ON A WEEKEND BASIS. AND EVEN IN THE SUMMER. AND IT WAS AN ORGANIZED SCHEME TO EITHER GIVE THEM GRAIN ALCOHOL OR DRUGS, TO GANG OR TRAIN RAPED THESE VICTIMS. SHE ALSO CLAIMS TO HAVE BEEN PART OF ONE OF THOSE GANG RAPES. SHE'S SAYING THAT THEY WOULD ATTEND PARTIES AND YOUNG GIRLS WERE DRUGGED AND. NOR DID ANYONE ELSE THAT EVER WENT TO ANY OF THESE PARTIES, NOT A SINGLE PARTY. NO SPECIFIC DATES WERE GIVEN AND NO NAMES WERE GIVEN OTHER THAN MARK JUDGE AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH. NO OTHER WITNESSES LISTED, NO ONE HAS CORROBORATED THESE CLAIMS. DURING THE ALLEGED TIME PERIOD, SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN ENROLLED IN COLLEGE WHILE KAVANAUGH WOULD HAVE BEEN A 15 OR 16-YEAR-OLD HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT. SHE DESCRIBED BOYS WAITING IN LINE TO RAPE DRUGGED WOMEN. SHE SAID SHE WENT TO AT LEAST TEN OF THESE PARTIES AND MANY MORE HAPPENED AND NOBODY EVER TOLD THE TEACHER. A LAW ENFORCEMENT REPRESENTATIVE, APPEARANCE, ANYBODY, EVERYONE THAT WAS A PART OF THIS ALL KEPT IT SECRET. IN A STATEMENT, KAVANAUGH REACTED TO THIS AND THIS IS WHAT HE SAID. THIS IS RIDICULOUS AND FROM THE TWILIGHT ZONE. I DON'T KNOW WHO THIS IS IN THIS NEVER HAPPENED. TODAY, JUST HOURS AFTER THESE ALLEGATIONS BECAME PUBLIC, 64 HIGH SCHOOL ACQUAINTANCES AND FRIENDS OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH RUSHED TO HIS DEFENSE IN A STATEMENT, CALLING THESE CLAIMS "NONSENSE. WE NEVER WITNESSED ANY BEHAVIOR THAT EVEN APPROACH IS WHAT IS DESCRIBED IN THIS ALLEGATION. IT IS REPREHENSIBLE AND THE EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF TIME WE HAVE COLLECTIVELY SPENT WITH BRETT KAVANAUGH, WE DO NOT RECALL HAVING EVER MET SOMEONE NAMED JULIE SWETNICK, NOR DID WE EVER OBSERVE HIM ENGAGING IN ANY CONDUCT RESEMBLING THAT DESCRIBED IN HER SO-CALLED DECLARATION. REMEMBER, JUDGE KAVANAUGH TOLD OUR OWN MARTHA MacCALLUM THAT HE WAS A THROUGHOUT ALL OF HIGH SCHOOL AND MOST OF COLLEGE. CAN'T BELIEVE WE ARE DISCUSSING THIS, BUT WE ARE, IS WHAT HE SAID. PEOPLE GENERALLY IN HIGH SCHOOL, I THINK ALL OF US HAVE DONE THINGS IN HIGH SCHOOL THAT WE LOOK BACK ON AND REGRET OR CRINGE A BIT. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. I NEVER SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ANYONE, I NEVER HAD ANY INTERCOURSE OR ANYTHING CLOSE TO INTERCOURSE IN HIGH SCHOOL AND MANY YEARS THEREAFTER. THE GIRLS FROM THE SCHOOLS I WENT TO AND I WERE FINE. SO YOU ARE SAYING THAT THEY'RE ALL THESE YEARS IN QUESTION YOU ARE A? THAT'S CORRECT. IF YOU NEVER HAD INTERCOURSE WITH ANYONE HIGH SCHOOL AND THROUGH COLLEGE SINCE WE ARE PROBING INTO YOUR PERSONAL LIFE HERE? MANY YEARS AFTER, I WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT. Sean: NOW TODAY SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM TWEETED OUT "I HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME BELIEVING THAT ANY PERSON COULD CONTINUE GOING TO TEN PARTIES OVER A TWO-YEAR PERIOD WHERE WOMEN WERE ROUTINELY GANG RAPE ED AND NOT REPORTED. WHY WOULD ANY PERSON CAN NEED TO PUT THEMSELVES AND THEIR FRIENDS IN DANGER? ISN'T THERE SOME DUTY TO WARN OTHERS? AND ALSO BREAKING MOMENTS BEFORE WE CAME ON AIR, NEW REPORTS THAT A RESTRAINING ORDER WAS FILED AGAINST JULIE SWETNICK BY HER EX-BOYFRIEND IN 2001. HER BOYFRIEND TONIGHT TELLING THE POLITICO "RIGHT AFTER I BROKE UP WITH HER SHE WAS THREATENING MY FAMILY, MY WIFE, THREATENING TO DO HARM TO MY BABY AT THAT TIME. AND THEN SHE SAID IN A TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH POLITICO, I KNOW A LOT ABOUT HER, SHE'S NOT CREDIBLE AT ALL, HE SAID IT, NOT AT ALL. LOOK WITH "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" IS REPORTING JUST MINUTES AGO. ROUGHLY A DECADE AGO, JULIE SWETNICK WAS INVOLVED IN A DISPUTE WITH A FORMER EMPLOYER, EMPLOYER, NEW YORK LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, OVER A SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINT THAT SHE FILED. ACCORDING TO PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH HER, THE FIRM WAS RUN BY DEBORAH KATZ, THE LAWYER CURRENTLY REPRESENTING DR. FORD AND THE COMPANY FINALLY REACHED A SETTLEMENT WITH JULIE SWETNICK ACCORDING TO PEOPLE IN "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" ." DESPITE EVERYTHING WE HAVE NOW SHOW DEAL, YOU HAVE, AND THIS IS WHY WE ARE IN A CRISIS IN THIS COUNTRY. MANY IN THE LEFT, MANY IN THE MEDIA, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THEY HAVE ALREADY CONVICTED JUDGE KAVANAUGH OF WHAT A HORRIFIC, LIFE SHATTERING CLAIM AND WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE, TAKE A LOOK. THIS IS A MONUMENTAL, DEFINING MOMENT THIS WEEK. WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE LIKE COFFEE GOING TO PRISON AND THEN KAVANAUGH GOING TO THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND. TO BE HONEST THAT'S A VERY WHITE MALE DEFENSE. PART OF THIS BACKLASH THAT WE ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW COMES FROM A CULTURE OF SEXISM AND PATERNALISM IN THIS COUNTRY, AND THAT SILENCE GENERATION AFTER GENERATION. THIS IS A PATRIARCHAL ON FOR MY FULL DISPLAY. THAT TO ME IT JUST WAS NOT BELIEVABLE. WE ALLOW THE PREDATOR IN CHIEF, THE ADMITTED PREDATOR IN CHIEF TO PLACE PEOPLE ON THE SUPREME COURT. HE IS PICKING THE TYPE OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY LIKE HIM. AND THIS THING AS A WHOLE INVESTIGATION NOW, IT SHOULD NOT GO FORWARD. Sean: WHILE THE LEFT, THE MEDIA AND THE DEMOCRATS ALL RUSH TO JUDGMENT, MANY OTHERS WITH SERIOUS CRIMINAL CLAIMS WILL UTILIZE THE SERVICES OF THE POLITICAL, VERY ANTI-TRUMPET, AND IT'S A SLEAZY LAWYER NAMED MICHAEL AVENATTI. EARLIER TODAY THE PRESIDENT HAD THIS TO SAY ABOUT HIM, TAKE A LOOK. President Trump: IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS LAWYER THAT JUST CAME OUT, HE'S A LOWLIFE. HE REPRESENTED DEMOCRATS AND NOBODY EVER TALKS ABOUT THAT. IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD ONE BUT HE IS A DEMOCRATIC LAWYER SO IT'S A HORRIBLE CON GAME AND I THINK THE PEOPLE ARE FINDING IT OUT. Sean: I WANT EVERYONE TO THINK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I BELIEVE AMERICANS ARE FAIR-MINDED. THIS ISN'T ABOUT REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS DENIED ALL OR CONSERVATIVE OR LIBERAL. MICHAEL AVENATTI, NANCY PELOSI, MAXINE WATERS, NOW THE NEW FACES OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. WE HAVE AN ELECTION IN 41 DAYS. I CALL MENOTTI GEARING UP FOR A PRESIDENTIAL RUN. THIS IS NOW, AND THIS IS WHAT WE GOT TO THINK ABOUT. THIS IS NOW A PARTY OF NO DUE PROCESS, NO RULE OF LAW, NO CONSTITUTION, A ZERO PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE. DO YOU KNOW, IT'S IN THE LAST 12 DAYS I CAN'T FIND A SINGLE DEMOCRAT THAT IS WILLING TO DEFEND THE PRINCIPAL OF PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE AND DUE PROCESS? BY THE WAY, THE PARTY OF BILL CLINTON AND KEITH ELLISON. SO TONIGHT WHAT WE ARE SEEING FROM MICHAEL AVENATTI ON THE PEOPLE ON THE LEFT IN THIS COUNTRY, SADLY, I TELL YOU THIS ALL THE TIME. THEY USE THIS TACTIC EVERY TWO AND FOUR YEARS, CHARACTER ASSASSINATION. IT'S THE NUMBER ONE TOOL IN THE DEMOCRATIC PLAYBOOK AND SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT CALLED OUT EARLY TODAY AND A POWERFUL PRESS CONFERENCE. HOW OFTEN DO I SAY EVERY TWO OR FOUR YEARS, THEY WILL CALL REPUBLICANS RACIST? HOW HORRIBLE IS THAT, SEXIST AND MISOGYNIST, XENA PHOBIC AND HOMOPHOBIC, ISLAMOPHOBIC? REPUBLICANS WANT DIRTY AIR AND WATER AND THEY WANT CHILDREN TO DIE AND THEY WANT TO THROW GRANNY OVER THE CLIFF. WE'VE NOW GOTTEN USED TO IT. BUT TO SAY THAT ABOUT PEOPLE, EVERY ELECTION SEASON, TO DO THIS WITH EVERY SUPREME COURT NOMINEE, HERE'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID. President Trump: THEY ARE ACTUALLY CON ARTISTS BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHAT QUALITY THIS MAN IS AND THEY'VE DESTROYED A MAN'S REPUTATION AND THEY WANT TO DESTROY IT EVEN MORE. I THINK PEOPLE WILL SEE THAT IN THE MIDTERMS, BUT THEY HAVE DONE TO THIS FAMILY AND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO THESE CHILDREN, THESE BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN OF HIS AND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO HIS WIFE. AND THEY KNOW IT IS A BIG FAT CON JOB. THEY GO INTO A ROOM AND I GUARANTEE YOU, THEY LAUGH LIKE HELL AT WHAT THEY HAVE PULLED OFF ON YOU AND ON THE PUBLIC. THEY LAUGH LIKE HELL. Sean: THE PRESIDENT KNOWS THE SHAMEFUL TACTICS OF THE LEFT FIRSTHAND. REMEMBER DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, REMEMBER WHEN "THE NEW YORK TIMES," I THINK IT WAS TOP FOLD, THEY FALSELY ACCUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP SEXUAL MISCONDUCT, THE SO-CALLED BOMBSHELL STORY. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE SOURCE OF THE TIME USED DENIED TRUMP EVER ACTED INAPPROPRIATELY. WE KNOW BECAUSE WE INTERVIEWED SOME OF THEM, A NUMBER OF THEM. HERE'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID ABOUT THAT EARLIER TODAY. President Trump: I WAS ACCUSED BY, I BELIEVE IT WAS FOR WOMEN. YOU CAN CHECK WITH SEAN HANNITY OR FOX BECAUSE THEY COVERED IT VERY STRONGLY. I WAS ACCUSED BY FOUR OR FIVE WOMEN WHO GOT PAID A LOT OF MONEY TO MAKE UP STORIES ABOUT ME. WE CAUGHT THEM IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA REFUSED TO PUT THAT ON TELEVISION. THEY REFUSE TO EVEN WRITE ABOUT IT. Sean: WE ACTUALLY FOLLOWED UP ON THAT PROGRAM. EVERYONE ELSE IN THE MEDIA IGNORING AND GOING ALONG WITH "THE NEW YORK TIMES" AND WHAT THEY PUT OUT. I ACTUALLY DID SOME REPORTING AND HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO INTERVIEW THE WOMEN FROM THE AT TIMES FAKE NEWS STORY. HERE'S WHAT THEY SAID AFTER THE TIMES MAKE THE ACCUSATION. TAKE A LOOK. I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM BE ANYTHING BUT A GENTLEMAN, A VERY GRACIOUS TO WOMEN AND RESPECTFUL OF WOMEN. ANYBODY THAT TELLS ME THAT I SAW THAT IT IS. HE WASN'T THAT WAY TO ME OR ANYBODY. I MET A LOT OF WOMEN WHEN HE WAS AROUND. HE EMPLOYS A LOT OF WOMEN AT DEALS WITH A LOT OF WOMEN AND HE RESPECTS THEM AND THEY RESPECT HIM. I BASICALLY WOULDN'T GIVE THEM A STORY AND THEN THEY CAME OUT WITH THEIR OWN VERSION OF IT AND TOOK SOMETHING OUT OF MY BOOK AND TOTALLY TWISTED IT AND MADE IT SO NEGATIVE. I HAVE NOTHING BUT POSITIVE THINGS TO SAY ABOUT DONALD TRUM DONALD TRUMP. Sean: I DON'T REMEMBER THE RETRACTION IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES" EITHER. THE LEFT'S CHARACTER ASSASSINATION STRATEGY DIDN'T START WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP, IT'S A TIME-TESTED PRACTICE FROM THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. REMEMBER WHAT THEY DID TO SUPREME COURT, ROBERT ROB SUPREME COURT, ROBERT ROR SUPREME COURT, ROBERT ROT SUPREME COURT, ROBERT ROB SUPREME COURT, ROBERT ROR REAGAN'S NOMINEE FOR THE U.S. SUPREME COURT, ROBERT RO? HE WAS NEVER NOMINATED BECAUSE OF ALL THE SLANDER. THE GUY THAT TOLD NOBODY AFTER HE LEFT A WOMAN TO DIE AFTER A CAR ACCIDENT AND WENT HOME AND WENT TO BED? ROBERT CHAPPAQUIDDICK KENNEDY. THIS IS A LAND WHERE WOMEN WILL BE FORCED INTO BACK ALLEY ABORTIONS, BLACK WOULD SIT AT SEGREGATED LUNCH COUNTERS, ROGUE POLICE COULD BREAK DOWN CITIZEN STORES IN MIDNIGHT RAIDS AND WRITERS AND ARTISTS WOULD BE CENSURED AT THE WHIM OF GOVERNMENT. Sean: THEN A FEW YEARS LATER, OF COURSE DEMOCRATS TRIED TO BRING THE PRIME COURT JUSTICE WHO BECAME ONE OF THE FINEST JUSTICES IN OUR GENERATION, CLARENCE THOMAS, THROUGH THE MUD. 1991, SENATE DEMOCRATS PULLED OUT HIS FORMER COLLEAGUE ANITA HILL MAKING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HIM. SOUND FAMILIAR? THIS CHARACTER ASSASSINATION WAS SO VICIOUS AND SO HORRIBLE, SO NASTY, JUSTICE THOMAS CALLED IT A HIGH-TECH LYNCHING. TAKE A LOOK. THIS IS A CIRCUS, IT'S A NATIONAL DISGRACE. AND FROM MY STANDPOINT AS A BLACK AMERICAN, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, IT IS A HIGH-TECH LYNCHING FOR UPPITY BLACKS WHO IN ANY WAY DEIGNED TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES. TO DO FOR THEMSELVES. TO HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS. AND IT IS A MESSAGE THAT UNLESS YOU KOWTOW TO AN OLD ORDER, THIS IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO YOU. YOU WILL BE LYNCHED, DESTROYED, CARICATURED BY A COMMITTEE OF THE U.S. SENATE, RATHER THAN HUNG FROM A TREE. Sean: THE CIRCUS OF DISGRACE IS BACK IN WASHINGTON AND THESE TACTICS DON'T STOP AT THE SUPREME COURT NOMINEES, MANY ALSO TRY TO DESTROY THE CHARACTER. I KNOW, I WAS IN ATLANTA AT THE TIME OF THE OLYMPIC BOMBING. RICHARD JEWELL FALSELY ACCUSED AS BEING THE LONE BOMBER. HE FIT THE PROFILE BECAUSE HE LIVED WITH HIS MOTHER. HE WAS LISTENING TO MY RADIO SHOW AT THE TIME AND SAID I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT STOOD UP FOR HIM AT LEAST GAVE HIM THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE. HE CHANGED MY LIFE. THEY ALSO SMEARED FALSELY ACCUSED REMEMBER THE DUKE LACROSSE TEAM? WE DIDN'T RUSH TO JUDGMENT ON THE SHOW. AND LET'S NOT FORGET WITH THE LEFT DATED IN FERGUSON. DARREN WILSON WAS FOUND INNOCENT IN THAT CASE. REMEMBER BALTIMORE, FREDDIE GRAY? TRAVE ON MARTIN, GEORGE ZIMMERMAN. HOW MANY TIMES DID PRESIDENT OBAMA RUSH TO JUDGMENT? THE CAMBRIDGE POLICE ACTED STUPIDLY. DURING EVERY BIG MOMENT, SO MANY IN THE LEFT AND SO MANY IN THE PRESS RUSHED TO JUDGMENT FOR PURE POLITICAL GAIN. THERE IS NO PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE EVER WITH THESE PEOPLE WHEN IT COMES TO POLITICS. HARRY REID LIES ABOUT MITT ROMNEY AND SAID HE HASN'T PAID TAXES IN TEN YEARS. WHEN ASKED ABOUT IT LATER AFTER THE ELECTION AND ROMNEY LOST, HE BOASTS ABOUT EIGHT. HE'S PROUD OF HIS LIFE. THIS HAPPENS EVERY ELECTION SEASON, ONE OF THE BIGGEST SMEARED JOBS OF ALL COMES FROM CHRISTOPHER STEELE'S DIRTY DOSSIER. A DOCUMENT BOUGHT AND PAID FOR BY HILLARY CLINTON AND THE DNC TO LIE TO YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, TO REAGAN ELECTION IN THIS COUNTRY AND THEN TO DESTROY A PRESIDENT AFTER WITH ABSURD UNTRUE SALACIOUS CLAIMS LIKE THIS. TRUMPS A "PERVERTED CONDUCT IN MOSCOW INCLUDED PAIRING THE PRESIDENTIAL SUITE AT THE HOTEL WHERE HE KNEW PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD STAYED ON ONE OF THE TRIPS TO RUSSIA AND DEFILING THE BED WHERE THEY HAD SLEPT BY HIRING A NUMBER OF TO PERFORM GOLDEN SHOWERS, IN OTHER WORDS, IN FRONT OF HIM. HE SAID THAT DOSSIER, THERE IS ONLY A 50/50 CHANCE. THOSE LIES WERE SPREAD TO YOU OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HILLARY PAID FOR IT, RUSSIAN ALLIES OF ALL THINGS. YET THE LEFT PUSH THESE UNVERIFIED AND UNCORROBORATED CLAIMS THROUGHOUT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF OUR GOVERNMENT RIGHT INTO THE GULLIBLE MEDIA, THEIR ARM THAT PUSHES THEIR PROPAGANDA. AS YOU CAN SEE, THE LEFT'S ATTEMPT TO DESTROY THE LIVES OF PEOPLE WITH BASELESS CLAIMS, IT IS A CLEAR, OBVIOUS AND NOW PREDICTABLE PATTERN. THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE UNFORTUNATELY, THESE ARE REAL LIVES WHEN YOU SAY THAT SOMEONE IS A RACIST OR SEXIST OR HOMOPHOBE, A GANG, REAL FAMILIES. DEMOCRATS, USING ALL OF THEM. PAWNS IN A POLITICAL GAIN, NO DUE PROCESS AND NO PERCEPTION OF INNOCENCE. HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF IT WAS YOU, AMERICA COMES TONIGHT? BECAUSE THIS IS THE MODERN DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THEY HAVE NOW DEFINED OF THEMSELVES AS A PARTY OF SLANDERERS, SMEAR, CHARACTER ASSASSINATION AND A PARTY OF THIS PARCHMENT. THIS IS CLEARLY WHO THEY ARE BECAUSE I CAN'T FIND A DEMOCRAT NOW SAYING THEY BELIEVE IN THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE. THIS NOW DEFINES THEM. THE ONLY ONE POWER FOR THEMSELVES. ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY, ABOUT SECURITY FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE? THIS IS WHY EVERY FAIR-MINDED AMERICAN HAS A RIGHT TO BE SKEPTICAL TONIGHT. WHAT YOU ARE WITNESSING IS ONE OF THE UGLIEST SMEAR CAMPAIGNS IN HISTORY. IF AMERICA DOESN'T GET THIS RIGHT, THERE WILL BE NO GOOD PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT EVER WANT TO SERVE THEIR COUNTRY FOR DECADES TO COME. WHY WOULD THEY? THEY ARE NOT DOING IT FOR THE MONEY. DEMOCRATS ARE NOW THE PARTY OF NO DUE PROCESS. THEY ARE THE PARTY OF NO PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE. THEY ARE NOT THE PARTY THAT BELIEVES IN THE CONSTITUTION. AS ONE DEMOCRAT SAID, PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE? I HAVEN'T HEARD THEM. AND YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY? BECAUSE THEY ALL SEEM TO BELIEVE
