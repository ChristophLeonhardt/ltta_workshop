welcome to D Westford live great to see you guys we were off yesterday there was a holiday in Canada I believe it was civics day and I learned that learn that by doing some research on the Internet of all places you believe that now I need you guys to keep me how our what-do-you-call is looking our stream is looking and how our connectivity is having a lot of problems they've been what's going on in the area where the studio is and it's really throwing our web for a loop it's it's made things really really difficult and so I want to bring you guys a top quality show it's just when we when we're dealing with this when we're dealing with it I won't say the name of the company that is our internet service provider but I will say that it has been really really difficult since they started putting these new lines in there there's some kind of bottleneck and they've been out there coming out again this week to read diagnose the problem I have been out here for a few hours to try to get this all fixed but for some reason we're still what I'm showing here locally is apparently bottlenecking on its way out at the hub is what they're telling me which is causing you guys to get a bit of a distorted streams I've got them coming back out tomorrow to rediagnosis really been a pain in the neck but that all being said a lot of problem or you could always super chat by the way I want to take your comments we're gonna be talking a lot about social media purging banning punishing conservatives I want to remind you guys about super chat you can make a small donation you can you pop your Chad your your question will pop to the top of the screen a nice bright box and we'll be able to say all great things about you and take your question first now the unfortunately we one of the things we deal with here is is uh we I'm next buddy boy you think they're gonna ban me turbo Jones bye bye YouTube it's over for you alright guys so here's the thing right it's here um Tom torn alright I'm a property right Scott and you've got YouTube and you've got Facebook and you've got Twitter and you've got Apple the iTunes Store and you've got Spotify you know I'm gonna be going with this and they're all private companies they're all private companies so at the end of the day they are absolutely free to do whatever it is they want to do the free to do it look if Twitter tomorrow said hey John Zeeland how are you my friend if Twitter tomorrow said we don't want your card yellow we don't want you we don't like your content we don't want you that's their right all right that's their prerogative they can do that they can do that and I have very little recourse very little recourse but be honest about it I would much rather Jack Dorsey over at Twitter Mark Zuckerberg over at Facebook whoever owns YouTube who runs YouTube I don't know I would much rather than say look or a private company we don't like conservatives we don't like conservatives we're gonna do this to you and the story if you don't like it leave if you don't like it leave boo Apple says yes but it was technology built with taxpayer money DARPA not wasn't it wasn't he's a private sector venture capital funded entities and they have every right to not like conservatives but admit it don't sit in front of Congress and say we're a fair platform we accept all voices we treat everybody the same and lie to America's face look it didn't matter that Zuckerberg sat there and was less than forthright forthright with Congress he wasn't under oath he didn't half Beneatha had to show up and quite frankly I think if he would have fought the subpoena he probably would have won because Facebook isn't a regulated business by the way it like my mug Facebook isn't a regulated business but um admit it look admit it now look at the incidents I'm talking about now you guys know on the show that I say I don't watch Alex Jones I don't buy into Infowars I have tons of problems with Alex Jones and his conspiracy theories over the years however I will fight to the end for Alex Joneses right to disseminate his content I don't have to agree with Alex's content I don't have to watch Alex I don't have to acknowledge Alex but it is chilling that they would try to shut him down now he's been banned from Facebook he's having his content pulled from the stores from Spotify it's all the silence him there saying Louis in the name of hate speech but that's nonsense that's nonsense Alex Jones has moronic conspiracy theories he said things about 9/11 in Sandy Hook that I think are incredibly distasteful and earned him a a permanent unfollow from me I'll never watch his stuff but credit would do he's got a lot of things right he's gotten a lot of things right he turned out some good work he's got some people who work for him but turn out very good work they have a right to be heard to be disseminated now again the places he's being banned are private sector entities that can ban but be honest about it Facebook shouldn't say that they're banning Alex Jones because they hate speech they're not they're not they're banning Alex Jones because his content leans too far right that's why they're banning Alex Jones now you saw the flare up the dust-up on Twitter the other day right where Candice Owens decided to replicate Sarah ji-yong you've seen Sarah gyeong for the New York Times Sarah giong has has surged young you know put out all those it's will and vile stuff Candace Owens takes Sarah Jones words literally word-for-word and simply changes white to black so I like doublet same thing said about web people can this immediately suspended from 12 hours all right idiot Lee suspended from Twitter for 12 hours for doing nothing more than replicating what Alex Jones Widow would Sarah Jiang said now not only not only was she not only was she banned from Twitter she and Charlie Kirk from Turning Point USA go out to brunch in Philadelphia and they get attacked they get attacked for having lunch now think about this pre Civil Rights Act in 1964 the Democrats were the Ku Klux Klan they've come full circle Democrats are now kicking black women out of lunch counters we're back pre Civil Rights Act with racist Democrats we're back when LeBron James I excoriated the LeBron yeah LeBron James for saying that we're back in the Jim Crow era he's right the Democrats attacking Candace Owens proved it black women can't even have brunch next to white people because racist Democrats will attack them and their white lunch partner and kick him out of the restaurant do these morons on the Left not see the irony so Candace Owens get suspended for using Sarah Jones exact words but because she inserted the wrong race great irony is Candace Owens is a black woman and for making comments about black women tongue-in-cheek of course sarcastically to prove a point she suspended for 12 hours from Twitter now Twitter reinstated her a little bit before that because conservatives lost their minds and just collectively bashed Twitter tag Jack Dorsey and Twitter had a backtrack now Twitter of course does what it did what it always does they said well it was a mistake and it's an algorithm y'all give me a break it was an algorithm an algorithm didn't catch Sarah Jones tweets an algorithm didn't catch the tweets of the black gangbangers who called for my death by name when I defend police and police should know not it's human intervention by foreign leftist and if it is an algorithm will a human program that algorithm they design they wrote that code and they knew what they did they pre inserted a bias into the code it's uh it's it's ludicrous it is simply ludicrous that we've got to put up with this alright but it is what it is it is what it is so does it surprise me that Alex Jones was banned no are there gonna be more conservative personalities and entities banned yes now democratic said let me see if I can find it Democratic Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut this is a really really left-wing guy he wants to seize your guns I'm gonna pull some of his tweets this is what Chris Murphy a sitting u.s. senator a man who took an oath to defend the Constitution this is what he wrote on Twitter only 14 hours ago so last night I'm at 9 p.m. Eastern Infowars about about 5 p.m. Eastern yesterday I mean Infowars of the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies they uses sites like Facebook and YouTube to tear our nation apart these companies must do more than take down one website the survival of our democracy depends on it this is a sitting u.s. senator advocating for censorship advocating the shutting down of the scenting speech this is chilling this is a guy who wants to take your guns who wants to crush your rights who says you should be regulated right before that tweet this is what he tweeted I know Facebook and Apple and YouTube have gotten so big they sometimes seem like the government but they aren't they are private companies that shouldn't knowingly spread lies and hate they took a good first step by removing Infowars did they remove Sarah giong did they remove the Washington Post The New York Times you notice that we doesn't call for them to remove any of the left-wing institutions any left-wing media no they want to purge conservatives now remember what is this what is Murphy doing what is the left achieving the you remember when Nancy Pelosi was Speaker of the House at Nancy Pelosi wanted the Fairness Doctrine which would limit conservative speech well that was shot down the Democrats are getting it they're getting it now through their like-minded cronies in Silicon Valley in the mainstream media that's what they're doing they're imposing via the private sector a de facto Fairness Doctrine to shut down conservative speech that's what they're doing it is disgraceful disgraceful disgusting but again they're private companies now one of the things people have to stop saying is start a conservative social media start a conservative Twitter start a conservative Facebook go to gab doesn't work it would require hundreds of millions of dollars in investment and years to build the awareness build a platform work out the bugs gab it it's got a few hundred thousand users it has no utility for media people people that we were we need to disseminate a message to the masses there just aren't enough hi don't say I profile but there just aren't enough people of significance using gab to make it worth while I haven't been on gab in a year I have a verified profile over there because it doesn't have any utility it's all the same people complaining about Twitter it doesn't have any utility as it as an information dissemination platform maybe it should have maybe it could have but I think they also let on some of the wrong people and focused on them and the quality people moved away so it would take a lot of money and a lot of time we need to pressure we need to pressure the the companies that exist with our dollars we need to do with the left us we need to find out who Facebook's bigger sponsors are and pressure them we need to find out what companies the big data aggregators who buy from Facebook sell to and pressure them that's how you make change in the economic well you you have to hit their economics you have to hit their bottom-line that's how you do it it's the best way to do it it's the only way to do it now look I don't want these companies regulated I don't want Facebook and Google regulated I don't want Twitter regulated but that's on them I am seeing some very compelling arguments though that Twitter and Facebook are potentially in violation of as FEC Federal Election Commission guidelines and the reason is pretty simple if your Twitter and you place a value on your platform and the value of information dissemination on your platform you say okay if you're gonna advertise and your advertisement is going to hit this many verified accounts and this many accounts in these regions well we're gonna charge you X and they begin to internally allow one candidate whose political ideology is more like there's more access to the masses on Twitter then they do the candidate on the right well it can be construed as a donation and an unreported donation and they could have FEC problems now gotta dig into that a little bit more but it's a really I've worked on campaigns for a long time it's a very compelling argument very compelling argument and I think an argument that needs to be made more often I don't like involving the FCC in the Federal Trade Commission because at the end of the day I'm a free-market guy and I don't want to see regulation so let us regulate like I said Facebook's real money is in selling your data find out who the big aggregators are they're probably axiom in LexisNexis and we know Cambridge analytical before they ceased operations and I'm gonna dig in about it I'm gonna do a show on who they are and then what I'll tell you is who those big aggregators sell to maybe it's a retail chain maybe it's a supermarket chain maybe it's the auto maybe it's the sporting-goods industry and their retailers and when we find out that's who we put pressure on that's where your Twitter campaign goes hey Auto company ABC we're boycotting your product because you get data from Facebook via this data aggregator and they're there Facebook is purging conservatives they're bias against conservatives and let's play the lefts game let's be smart about it let's find out where the money trail goes follow the money let's follow the flow of the revenue and that's how we put pressure because it's conservatives I don't want to as a conservative I don't want the federal government stepping in and being Big Brother being my bodyguard I don't want that that's a knife that cuts both ways it's a knife that cuts both ways I don't want that I don't want that because then they come back and they regulate everything they come back and they regulate everything now somebody brought something up I was gonna talk about it tomorrow but it's a Tony Craig top secrets a good distraction from that Chinese spy work of the Dems huh this is a story that requires a lot a lot of detail and I want to cover it all tomorrow but Senator Dianne Feinstein had a Chinese spy on her payroll for 20 years did you see that top of Yahoo news is that trending on twitter is Facebook blasting that out I'm gonna tell you all about that tomorrow all about that tomorrow truck my ad says none of this is free market now this is exactly the free market the free market allows a private sector entity to discriminate it most certainly does I own a bar I should be able to say no one with red shirts can come into my bar I don't like red shirts I hate them no red shirts allowed as long as I'm not discriminating based on race or gender or a disability I should be able to discriminate now political ideology is not a protected class and I don't think it should be I don't think anybody should be a protected class anybody I think a business should be able to discriminate against whomever they want they don't want white men in there tell me I can't come in and that'll mean that the majority of America the highest earners in America white men will not patronize your establish a business so discriminate against me I welcome it I don't like protected classes I don't like uh uh hate crime laws no life is worth more than another there should not be an enhanced sentence if one race is killed over another that is the ultimate in discrimination telling one race you're worth less than another so this race for killing someone or leading someone of this race you do more jail time than for that race that is the most discriminatory thing on the planet affirmative action is ridiculously discriminatory we're going to promote you on the basis of your race that is the definition of discrimination you're going to get a job over this candidate even though they're more qualified because of your race that is the epitome of racism truck my ad donate it said I enjoy the show everybody don't agree truck I love that I love that I want you here if you don't agree debate argue with me love having you here truck thank you very very much pleasure to have you every day hopefully every day but see this is what I'm talking about we want this debate discrimination comes when government steps in and says that race is entitled to more than that race that gender that orientation is entitled to more than that one it's ludicrous so that's why I don't want regulation of these social media platforms look you discriminate enough there's gonna be a back sixty-three mil backlash 63 million Americans voted for Donald Trump okay many many more support him today there are conservatives all over the world I've been rented a so I didn't what I normally do is I watch my my chat stream and I see where you guys come in from but every day it's South Africa Australia New Zealand Canada the UK Scotland Ireland Asia you guys come in from all over the world all over the world Jay Cahill's in from Ireland how you doing Jay George Watson from Canada now you come in from all over the world there are conservatives all over the world that access these platforms these platforms will suffer they'll suffer austria's here Cromwell awesome UK in the house awesome awesome awesome flat wind flyer from the UK some of these names Stefan's in from Denmark Nicole from Arizona hey Nicole how are ya see we've got people from all over the place coming on in now here's the thing let's see Poland Switzerland this is so cool I love watching it so Australia is waking up New Mexico Quebec Wow fast and furious therefore Germany Michigan more from Ireland Kingston Ontario Canada Denmark you see what I'm saying though South Africa conservatives are all over the world in Netherlands I've got rail wool from the Netherlands getting this one from North Korea North Korea Wow that isn't pretty Pyongyang or in a suburb are you in a bedroom community of Pyongyang so my point is and you guys are seeing you're watching the chat and article Tony's in from Antarctica stay warm stay warm you and the guy from North Korea should share some stories all right but you get my point right you get my point people are coming in from all over the place again we've got Jimmy Lee from Kentucky named and they're conservatives all over the world so these platforms suffer right they don't need to be US based that's what it's not going to matter if the u.s. FCC or the FEC or the Federal Trade Commission the FTC regulate them not going to matter if they regulate them because it's a worldwide thing it's a worldwide web access to this so by purging conservatives by trying to silence conservatives they're hurting themselves but we'd like I said we've got to be smart we've got to play the left game now they think that they're impervious because of the data game it's a big ambiguous right been ambiguous but I worked in that world for a lot of years in law enforcement after law enforcement tracking bad guys bought ridiculous amounts of data I know how that trail works so I'm gonna be digging in I'm gonna really be digging in to who they sell their data to because make no mistake look you go on these platforms for free all right nothing in life is free boys and girls they're selling your data you agree to that in the terms and conditions and I don't mind um that they're selling data they've got to make money nobody's forcing you to upload stuff Keith McIntosh $50 damn Keith thank you very much test he said something important I want to she's talking about the Broward School race is here and we've got a big school board race coming up in Broward County doesn't mean a lot oh you guys from around the world it goes to the censorship issue I want to touch on this the terrible parkland shooting right Robert run ski run see the school's chief in Broward County newspaper for publishing a report on the shoot which makes look bad now Robert Runcie the school chief in Broward County a guy whose ineptitude who does an action led to the parkland shooting he was found to be quite liable in this report may look very bad he's a far left Obama Democrat from Chicago he's suing local media for daring to publish the report a public report funded by taxpayers much like Chris Murphy from Connecticut wants social media to silence conservatives my name is love says your feet is lagging I know we're trying to work that out it was great for most of the show now we're having a little problem hopefully it'll come back we got them coming back in tomorrow to diagnose the issue but see this is the thing with liberals they want to silence dissent they don't like dissent you don't why the gun no message they've got no message none now John Doe says you tubers have it hard have a hard on cause alex is gone and you all will be next so I don't know if you're a troll or if you make it out who cares who cares lupine says stream lag is good it means the AI is watching yeah but you know what it's annoying it is annoying we had a really great stream I don't know why we keep running into this problem it's just annoying really really really troubling let's see what's going on here take some comments now wow wow not a lot of them somebody said where is Trump Trump you should stop Facebook Google YouTube is they have breaching laws and silencing and censoring free speech free speech they're not they are not you don't have free speech on a private-sector platform this is what I try to explain the Conservatives you have no freedom of speech on YouTube it's a private sector entity you have no freedom of speech on Twitter you have no freedom of speech on Facebook you have freedom of speech in the public square in the public arena not on a social network not on a social network or a platform owned by somebody else you don't have freedom of speech there Joe Moss says its antitrust but it's not it's not antitrust anyone is free to start a new platform if customers don't use it it's not antitrust antitrust means when one company is so big that they go out of their way to crush others no one would stop us from starting a social network gap exists Twitter did not get out of business people just chose to use Twitter not gab that's not antitrust it's not antitrust Facebook seize took CIA in-q-tel money in-q-tel is CIA's venture capital arm after they started Facebook as a publicly traded company so there's a lot of bad information out there these are not First Amendment violations these are not antitrust violations what just because the company grows because people choose not to use other social networks look Facebook was the little kid on the black myspace was bigger Facebook was more user intuitive people moved over to Facebook that was it there were other social networks you success is not antitrust violations and antitrust violation people throw these turns around but they're not not accurate I hear freedom of speech freedom of speech First Amendment First Amendment First Amendment you don't have one and on a private platform they can shut you down for any reason you agree to that in the terms and conditions that's what you agree to hmm Daniel Barret Barker says not much but every little bit helps keep up the good fight revelry donated five pounds it helps and we thank you and for your support right-wing platforms do not need it do not support businesses that support these platforms support the little guy Neil Williams well yeah but you know what you're never going to grow to critical mass being a little guy this is not going to happen John Zeeland wants that over the rebels gonna have a party when we reach 1 million YouTube subscribers it's a good idea I'll have to bring that up with Ezra and the crew it's outrageous they would do it especially because they lied to do so for Western civilization I'm assuming he means ban people like Alex Jones let's see they will be coming to shut down the rebel next well Cole the rebel probably gonna fight him let's see flourescent says there must be a legal action against governments Google YouTube and Facebook at other platforms that silence our opinions and truth because inconvenient and does not suit their interest or agenda no no first look government is different than private sector if government shuts down your free speech in a public place you do every course if private companies do it you don't and you shouldn't I'm a property rights fan so the way you pressure a private company is to go after their revenue you go after their revenue and let's see truck my ads is they won't shut down the serve it is now they won't why would they they're their allies they love each other their buddies hang out they hang out on those Bill Kristol cruises Cromwell says censorship with a free media spreading worldwide and the only conclusion you can draw from this is that the world order is showing its teeth yep the globalists want to shut down let's see the private sector only answer is - that was a good comment share hold well Ed's to shareholders only or investors at their private which is right that's why you go after their revenue n LG HT n donated government officials use it needs to be run like a utility thanks for the donation should I completely disagree I don't want to see private entities run like utilities and regulated it sets a terrible terrible dangerous precedent for business a terrible precedent very dangerous Nigel why has info war shut believe and shut they've been banned from Facebook they saw their own website time to regulate social media like power companies disagree do not want to see regulation conservatives don't want regulation let's see why is Hillary not rotting in prison house man asks because there's a different standard of justice for the Clintons don't you know very different hmm Andrew burr sac is right see if you regulate private business than you over regulate it's exactly what we don't want Dead Frontier says what is your opinion about Obama's interference that I needed comments towards the new government is this set of president or energy in the US I think Barack Obama needs to shut his mouth he was the worst president in history the worst president in history Keith McIntosh gave us more Mexican million help me understand the you don't want something a 4.5 billion dollar pipeline sent 50 million in Palestine no way to stop no what is barrier to wall a lot in there look Trudeau's a disaster he's your Obama the barrier to the wall here in the United States or the Democrats that's the barrier to the wall John Doe is a troll so we're gonna block John though next time he comes around alright uh as Deb McGee says cuz the jails refused to look because the jails refused to lower standards and accept Hillary as an inmate yeah she's gonna bring the neighborhood down Hillary comes to jail as there goes the neighborhood Hillary's here all the other inmates are really embarrassed about being in jail and I want to tell people worthy well if she's on their cell block they lie about living in a different cell block yeah let's see what else we got here then why are power companies regulated by the government its regulation is bad because power companies are given a legal monopoly that's not the case with social media anyone is free to start a new social media entity let's say in public domain and YouTube Facebook our public domains they must that's not accurate that's not accurate not in the u.s. anyway not in the US not in the US you know not in the US just not the truth you know in the US the First Amendment applies to government it doesn't apply to the private sector doesn't apply to the private sector will Gibbon says what do I think about Tommy Robinson being free I think it's great I think it's great I think it's said that he's still gotta face charges that he's only out on bail I think the whole thing is silly and moronic but such as life in the UK you know I feel horrible Joe Moss is arguing me saying it is antitrust whether I want to admit it or not it's not antitrust you're free to set up a success is not antitrust what you're asking for is nationalization and socialism of Industry for the government to come in and take over companies that are too successful or regulate them no no no take that take that back to whatever country countries do that that's not America that's not America let's see Infowars pissed off the CIA no that's not it they're just to right-wing believe me they you guys are confusing public entity with publicly traded company a public entity is not a publicly traded company publicly traded company is still a private entity it's just owned by the shareholders MxA let's say it wasn't an MX given he's making me I'm gonna be very wealthy in Mexico Keith McIntosh says makes no sense GOP rules Congress Senate and presidency this connect just doesn't understand well we need because in the Senate we've got that dumb rule or I need 60 votes and we only have a 51 majority so the Democrats still can hold things up in the Senate not in the house barb says great show how can we pressure the private sector to give speech what would help like I said so we're gonna do is we're gonna look at who Facebook Twitter sell their data to and who those large data companies sell that data to that's who we press to stop buying and I'm gonna be doing a lot of research on that and bringing you those answers Neal Williams donate it again five pounds thank you Neal thank you to barb we appreciate it let's see Bush 10 just as I say they are privately owned and they all take government subsidies every company does in the form of tax breaks and all it doesn't make them nationalized entities I got to tell you guys I'm kind of concerned with how many here would like to see business nationalized by the government that is not a conservative position not a conservative position at all yep this is a great comment Frank Vanda Pitts says social media pride ourselves and is a really good comment by Frank van Defense's social media prided themselves on being just platforms not publishers not so long ago you're right now all of a sudden their publishers were gonna police their content that's a great great great comment let's see let's see there are other platforms they may be small but folks need to support them when the big boys misbehave in order to hold them accountable yes and that's why it's not antitrust these other platforms exist that they're not successful is on them look I ve disagree with Facebook's politics I vehemently disagree with Twitter's politics but what I don't disagree with is their success they did something right to get billions of collective users I'm never going to condemn a company for its success that's an American that's unamerican dirt dogs I've got to tell you I'm concerned with your defense of these monopolies they're not monopolies a successful company just because you don't want to use these other entities does not make a certain entity a monopoly it doesn't because you've got to remember something if you let them regulate today tomorrow they regulate the gun industry they regulate your cell phone so that government software is on every cell phone guys don't understand the Pandora's Box you want to open with regulation you do not understand you want every gun registered back to the owner you want the gun companies to have to make only one type of firearm that serves no purpose open the door with this kind of regulation to the private sector no good no good no regulation let the free market work right now with the free market is telling us is that Facebook and Twitter are offering a better service than the other guys now it's up to the other guys to be smarter to figure out what Facebook and Twitter offer what they don't exploit the vulnerability and do what they do better that's what Facebook did to MySpace and they won so someone else can win that is not a monopoly that is not antitrust that's the free market and that's what needs to be done you don't blame Twitter because the engineers over at gab turned out a product that's not user intuitive because they marketed poorly because they cultivated certain people on the platform who had ideas that the mainstream bigger bigger name figures wanted to distance themselves from they made engineering and marketing mistakes that's not Twitter's fault somewhere out there is a very smart person or a group of people and they're gonna crack that nut they're gonna figure out how to make a better social network and they're gonna succeed maybe they're conservative maybe they're liberal I don't know I don't know but leave it to the free market do not regulate do not regulate now good question from Andrew Berg sack what are my thoughts on Facebook wanting to tide Bank info to their platform I think it's chilling and it should never be allowed under any circumstance never be allowed under any circumstance market is legalese for baby needs no market is free market it means we decide we vote with our dollars that's what the free market means that's what the free market means the BBC is a fake propaganda brainwashing news channel why would anyone buy a TV licence well look the BBC a state-run media that's what happens when you get state-run media and the funny thing is I see many people saying the BBC and the CBC are dishonest and then calling for regulation of US companies do you want government-run social networks and media and Czech nationalists on that Ezra I'm John Ezra's got a different show let's okay far right and far left opinions of free speech here in America yep they are yep Facebook zone 20% by Zuckerberg yeah Bill Gates only own about 37% of Microsoft and then he even sold more of that all I let me see let me go through we have so many mm-hmm we have so many comments today alex is back it was all his son Howard G says now Alex was in Facebook Infowars site was never taken down now people misunderstood that they were banned from Facebook their their programs were pulled off of iTunes and Spotify people aren't mistaking that their site was brought down yeah right so Charlie Brown now says good point about regulation it's like Microsoft Windows Office people have a choice to use Linux on PC no one forces people to use only Windows exactly just Windows was easier to use it was a more intuitive product some more people bought it other options exist you choose not to use them because one product works better it's that simple that's not a monopoly that's not antitrust people confuse that they confuse that a new content will not be allowed either I believe for Infowars well they're gone so that new content none of their content historical archived or new they're gone from those platform they're gone from those platforms somebody's saying the Alex Jones YouTube channel got deleted to up okay I don't know that but I guess so let's see bring down the NWO the New World Order entities well we're trying we are so easily programmed it's all laid out of head of us they laugh at us cars in space I don't know what that means but I like the idea of cars in space Jay Cahill we are getting banned for bloody silly reasons from Facebook yeah yeah well look like I said at the beginning of the show the the rules are very arbitrary incredibly arbitrary and as a conservative just gotta be careful you got to learn their game learn how to play it let's see UK censorship is alive and well yep it is yep it is once any other company becomes a real threat and the larger company will acquire the smaller one that's why we need to keep the market fair but the smaller one doesn't have to sell see that's still not a monopoly or antitrust if I start a company and I do so well that Facebook comes to me and says I want to pay you two billion dollars there's no Gundam I had to take the money I'd be a dummy not to take it but I'm selling freely the market made me successful a competitor or a partner in business decided I was valuable enough to add to their portfolio of brands and wants to buy me they're not crushing me they're not drowning me in lawsuits to bankrupt me and put me out of business that would be an antitrust problem that would be a monopoly problem they're coming to me and saying hey you're doing really well we want to give you a lot of money to buy you I'm free to say no we really like running the business or I'm ready to retire pay me that's the way the free market works that's the way the free market works and it's called an exit strategy most people start companies with an exit strategy in mind to either be acquired by a bigger competitor for a lot of money or to go public hmm you don't start a business just to work the rest of your life and run it you want that big payday where you can go and sit on your yacht and do nothing libertarian position is privatization of roads how would that work would government have to sell the roads to people and wouldn't that one person have a monopoly on the road or example yeah that's why those will never work libertarianism for social issues is wonderful I subscribe to much when it comes to infrastructure and defense it falls down with no real solutions so there are places for government but in a very very limited fashion in my opinion then explain what and government broke up the phone company because they were given the monopoly and then it got too big Czech nationalists says John could you tell me if you think America became a constitutional presidential State I'm from Europe so I don't know no no we are we're a constitutional republic in our Constitution gives the executive branch many many admit administration based powers and Donald Trump is exercising them but it's in line with the Constitution I don't see anything happening that's concerning quite frankly even with Obama he stretched them but he acted within his authority for everything he bought Obamacare and immigration let's see we've got a lot of comments coming in mm-hmm whoa whoa whoa I can't even read it Infowars is still live-streaming yeah well they're still up they're just they're just you know banned from certain platforms nobody took their site down let's see what if some people owning lots of shares holding the kick out like Jones off or sell those shares that's the free market if I owned the majority of a company and I say I don't like that guy I don't want them involved with our company that's how it works that's how it works well somebody Zoll I don't know Allah doggie why haven't we the people got together yet and started our own social media platform easily done where you getting the money were you getting the back-end infrastructure who's coating it who's the project manager who's paying their salaries it's not that easily done it takes a lot of money a lot of zeros to build that all right so John Doe we know is a troll and John Doe just wants to so let's say John Doe is gone by John Doe goodbye I Nigel says what is Infowars done that so bad nothing now they've done some dumb conspiracy things but nothing to be banned the way they were they were right wing it were right leaning that's all that's all let's say NL ghcn says taking gab of Google App Store to keep Twitter the top dog as an antitrust or just private company well it is it is because it's the App Store it they're a private entity they can take any app off they want they don't have to leave you on there and I've got some issues to a Gaby's run um I just think they gravitated toward the wrong people again the whole it's free speech works for gabon gab that's their right but they've got to understand that it doesn't that that doesn't extend to the places where they sell their product now I can disagree with it but it doesn't surprise me why it happened truck my ad says domain registrar's do that - yep but again they're private entities they can do that look you got to understand that you live in a world we are where corporate marketing people tend to swing left alright and because they tend to swing left and truck thanks for the donation because they tend to swing left they're going to infuse that bias into the minds of corporate management into the minds equipment and so that's why you're getting these problems that is why you're gonna have these problems you know let's see see Chrissy Chrissy says Alex is usually right that's why he sense or not it's more than that now is that he's right leaning and he's fiery and they don't you understand the left is desperate they see the Democratic Party's fallen apart it has no message none let's say Alex Jones will win his defamation case and these non monopolies will pay maybe maybe I don't know what his defamation case is a private sector entity removed him from their platform frustrated left wing lower judges especially Obama's leftovers in the ninth circuit are more in control than the Trump administration temporarily good point temporarily when they rule in favor of illegals and bad guys but eventually it'll get up to this Supreme Court which is now pretty conservative and and ultimately will win let's see hmm no message so shut up conservatives madness oh you're saying the dens have no message so they shut up conservatives yeah it's pretty much it it's pretty much it cast troy 54s is the greatest threat the freedom comes from the left I agree I couldn't agree more mm let's see libertarianism with the final solution yeah libertarianism is very weak on defense we live in a dangerous world non-interventionism is a very noble and ideal concept doesn't work in the real world let's see Democrats and MSM going crackhead crazy yep Gail Koch me and Ohio Republicans vote today they do get out there and vote for the Republican Cathy Madson donate a 5 bucks Thank You Cathy you have a question mm-hmm Cathy if you do just let me know and this one likes my mug you like that mug dad it's my don't tread on me mug I bought two of those cuz I figured they might be taking off the store shelves let's see yeah my libertarian mug yep yep yep a listen when it comes to stuff like that all day long all day long but I'm not a non-interventionist I think we've got to kill the bad guys over the air before they over there before they kill us over here it's been working for 17 years I'm not a fan of wars but I also don't want to see 3,000 Americans Canadians Europeans die on their own soil either so I'd rather kill him over their contact info says am i from Canada nope I'm the rebels of American guy I'm down in Florida from New York down in Florida almost 15 years yep came south palm trees Sun been rainy windy Payne says Tommy Robinson for prime minister I don't know if time he'd want that job at this point I don't know if he'd want that job but England could do worse and ruber SEC says historically the Democrats have been on the wrong side of history well they were the party of the Ku Klux Klan they were the party that opposes the Civil Rights Act in 1964 yep they certainly have Democratic Party sprung from the Confederacy the Dixiecrats so they really have they really have been on the wrong side of history let's see do I like Bernie Sanders god no a crazy old communist and no no no no no no no dude if some guy kills you media won't care no it probably won't they probably won't and I was responding before he froze up to truck my ad said dude if some ghetto thug kills you major media won't care now they was they tried it was a Bronx cow they failed let's see - I watched Trump rallies gay Laskey of course I do I've been to several down here in Florida it's uh it's actually a good time they're pretty fun let's see Bernie is okay just don't talk politics nothing about Bernie is okay Bernie Sanders a communist he honeymoon in communist Moscow back in the 1970s when Russia was our most aggressive bitter enemy nothing about Bernie Sanders okay greetings John I want to be at a trump rally you should go to one they're pretty fun oh we've got a flat earther here we've got a flat earther that is so silly so silly question anyone do private companies inside the USA not at the follow the USA's laws like we have here in Europe no of course they have to follow our laws of course they do and this one asks how hot is it in Florida here in London is boiling been pretty hot but in the high 80s every day I mean it's August in South Florida boy I'll tell you what it hasn't been as unbearable as it was last summer so we're hoping we don't have a bad hurricane season again but typically we get two bad ones in a row and then we're okay for about ten years last year was pretty bad I'm guessing this year might be bad as well yeah hmm let's see what else will they arrest Obama soon Obama's not getting arrested don't believe that nonsense neither is Hillary don't believe those QED conspiracy theorists hangman John Ruth good morning John good morning hang man good to see you man you're in late today hmm yeah my name is love's it's hot everywhere it is Florida's been pretty hot this summer but it's been pretty easy been nice in the evenings and went about 6:30 Eastern this morning walk my dogs it was pretty nice you could sell it it was just getting hot the Sun is pretty brutal though Suns been pretty brutal lately question what do I think about the situation in Venezuela I think it's tragic I think that whole Maduro assassination thing it looks to me like he did it himself it was one of those amateur attempts I've ever seen it certainly wasn't the u.s. trying to whack him if we wanted a wacom he'd be dead yeah no fires in Florida hopefully Nigel says no no because it's been pretty actually we've gotten rain every day and so even though it's super hot here we've gotten a pretty strong rain every evening or early morning and typically this time of year one coming through in the afternoon so the Everglades out in those areas that could burn there wet they've been enough that happened let's see we got here guys so the stream is getting a little bit stream is starting to lag a little bit so rather than have you guys deal with that like I said it's treating starting lag a little rather than have you guys deal with that for the last five minutes I'm going to end it up now I will be back with you tomorrow morning unless they're here to put the final fixes on this they're supposed to come a bit later but if they make it earlier here I got one more paid for comment bye keep maghen that so anytime the president wants to spend an amount of money that represents a rounding error in the overall budget he has to get Dems on his side if yes that's crazy why make any promise it's a little more complex than that would deals the president can cut and already funded things we need to go back to a simple majority in the Senate that something President Trump is working on he wants that cappy Madson says revoking section 230 protection for YouTube and Facebook help maybe they would fight a tooth and nail I don't think it would happen they would fight it tooth and nail alright guys I'm going to end on this note so the stream doesn't live in a couple of minutes anyway so the stream doesn't cut out on you again be back with you tomorrow morning 7:30 a.m. Eastern thanks so much for being with me love being with you every morning thanks for watching guys see you tomorrow
