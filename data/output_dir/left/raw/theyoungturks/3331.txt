1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,940
TAYLOR SWIFT, SHE IS IN THE
NEWS.

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,639
SHE'S IN THE NEWS BECAUSE

3
00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:09,179
THE ACLU REACHED OUT TO HER
LAWYER AND SOME PEOPLE ARE

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:16,670
CLAIMING THAT HER LEGAL TEAM IS
TRYING TO CONTAIN OR STRICT

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:17,890
FREEDOM OF SPEECH.

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,970
HERE IS WHAT
HAPPENED.

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:21,970
I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:26,750
THIS HONESTLY UNTIL WE START
TALKING ABOUT IT BUT APPARENTLY

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,000
SOME PEOPLE ON THE ALL RIGHTS
HAVE FOUND SOME SYMBOLISM THEY

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,560
LIKE WITHIN HER LYRICS,
ESPECIALLY IN THE SONG AND THE

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,190
VIDEO FOR LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME
DO.

12
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,070
THERE WAS A BLOGGER FROM
POP

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,320
FRONT WHO WROTE THIS ABOUT THAT
SINGLE:

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:01:09,190
SAYING THEY FOUND SOME NAZI
IMAGERY IN THE VIDEO, WE HAVE AN

15
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:13,780
IMAGE OF IT ACTUALLY, TAYLOR
LOOKING OUT OVER THIS ROOM FULL

16
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:18,100
OF MODELS FROM A PODIUM AND THIS
WRITER, THIS BLOGGER SAYS THAT

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,100
THAT IS REMINISCENT OF WHAT
HITLER DID.

18
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,100
HER LAWYERS

19
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,100
RESPONDED TO POP FRONT.

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,100
YOU CAN
SEE, THAT IS WHAT THE MODELS

21
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,100
LOOK LIKE IN THE AUDIENCE THERE.

22
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,450
HER LAWYER SENT A CEASE AND

23
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:31,480
DESIST LETTER TO THIS WRITER,
MEGAN HURTING AND HER LAWYER

24
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:52,280
SAID:

25
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,441
SO THAT PROMPTED THE WRITER,
MEGAN HURTING TO CONTACT ACLU

26
00:01:56,441 --> 00:02:01,610
AND THE LAWYERS FROM THE ACLU
HAVE SENT A LAWYER TO TAYLOR

27
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:14,440
SWIFT'S LAWYER SAYING:

28
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,650
THERE YOU SEE THE ACLU DEFENDING
THIS BLOGGER'S FREEDOM OF

29
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,790
SPEECH AND NOW THERE ARE SOME
ARTICLES OUT THERE WHERE PEOPLE

30
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,400
ARE SAYING THAT HER LAWYERS ARE
TRYING TO SILENCE THIS WRITER.

31
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,400
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK ABOUT
THIS?

32
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,970
IT'S THE STREISAND EFFECT
AGAIN.

33
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,560
YOU SAY DON'T TALK ABOUT

34
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,940
THIS ARTICLE THAT TAYLOR SWIFT
DIDN'T LIKE.

35
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,250
I HAD NEVER HEARD

36
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,820
OF THIS ARTICLE BEFORE AND NOW
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT.

37
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:44,270
I THINK THIS IS REALLY COLD ON
THE PART OF TAYLOR SWIFT.

38
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,349
I HAVE TO WONDER WHAT WENT ON
BEHIND THE SCENES HERE.

39
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:49,510
DID SHE ASK HER LAWYER, SANCTION
THIS?

40
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,880
WAS THIS LAWYER, MAYBE THERE'S A
PROTOCOL IN THE TEAM OF SWIFT

41
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,430
AND IT IS LIKE IF YOU SEE THE
FOLLOWING THINGS THEN YOU HAVE

42
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,030
TO GO AFTER THEM AND HIT THEM
WITH A CEASE AND DESIST.

43
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,240
I JUST

44
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,069
DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

45
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:03,069
TAYLOR IS A
PERSON.

46
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:04,069
SHE IS NOT AN ENTITY.

47
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:06,700
I KNOW WE SOMETIMES FEEL LIKE
SHE IS BECAUSE SHE IS A HUGE

48
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,940
POPSTAR BUT SHE IS A PERSON.

49
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,170
IF YOU DISAGREE WITH SOMEBODY,

50
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,780
ENGAGE WITH THEM.

51
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,310
WHEN
BREITBART WAS RETREATING THE

52
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,880
LYRICS TO LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME
DO, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY

53
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:22,270
TAYLOR SWIFT DIDN'T REPLY
AND SAY, HEY, I DON'T LIKE THIS.

54
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:27,069
I DON'T SUPPORT YOU GUYS
RETWEETING MY LYRICS.

55
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:28,069
BUT SHE

56
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:35,250
DOESN'T, THE PERSON WHO WROTE
THIS IS SOMEONE WHO HAS

57
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,600
OPINION WHO IS SUBSTANTIATED BY
THINGS, TAYLOR SWIFT IS A

58
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,099
PERSON, ENGAGE WITH PEOPLE
THAT ARE INSERTING THEIR

59
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:43,540
CRITICISM OF YOUR ART.

60
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,720
BE A PERSON ABOUT IT.

61
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,810
LIKE YOU SAID, THIS IS POP
FRONT.

62
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,810
WHATEVER THAT IS, IT'S

63
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:52,050
NOT THE OUTLET TO DRAW THIS
COMPARISON BETWEEN ALL RIGHTS

64
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,360
PROPAGANDA AND TAYLOR SWIFT
SONGS.

65
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,190
OTHER MAJOR OUTLETS DID,

66
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,800
I THINK BY STATE AND A COUPLE OF
OTHERS.

67
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,030
I'M THINKING THAT THE

68
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,489
LAWYERS TARGETED THIS ONE
BECAUSE IT MIGHT HAVE SEEN

69
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:05,900
LIKE A MORE ATTAINABLE TARGET,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

70
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,099
A LITTLE GUY.

71
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:10,580
A POWERFUL
PERSON ATTACKING LITTLE GUY.

72
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,580
IF

73
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,130
IT WAS IN THE NEW YORK TIMES,
THEY WOULD NOT DARE.

74
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,130
I THINK,

75
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,199
THE ACTUAL TAKE ITSELF THAT THE
BLOGGER HAD I FEEL IS PROBABLY

76
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,370
LOOKING WAY TOO DEEP INTO
SOMETHING.

77
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,440
IT'S A BIT OF A

78
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,440
REACH.

79
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,529
TAYLOR SWIFT IS A
FRIVOLOUS POPSTAR IN THE SONG IS

80
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:30,759
A TOTALLY FRIVOLOUS SONG.

81
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,400
IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE TO READ ANYTHING

82
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,849
DEEPER AND IT OTHER THAN THE TOP
SURFACE LEVEL THING BUT THAT

83
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:43,580
DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE SHOULD
CONDONE A MORE POWERFUL PERSON

84
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,070
FROM SILENCING A LESS POWERFUL
PERSON JUST BECAUSE THEY DON'T

85
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,349
LIKE WITH THE PERSON SAID.

86
00:04:48,349 --> 00:04:50,289
WE
ARE STARTING TO SEE A GROWING

87
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:57,539
TREND IN AMERICA OF RICH PEOPLE
BASICALLY SHUTTING DOWN

88
00:04:57,539 --> 00:04:59,080
JOURNALISM THAT THEY DO NOT
LIKE.

89
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,969
THERE WAS THE PETER THIEL

90
00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:03,119
SHUTDOWN OF GAWKER.

91
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:06,610
THE WAR THE
HE WAGED FOR YEARS AND ENDED UP

92
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,610
WINNING.

93
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,610
IT SET A HUGE
PRECEDENT.

94
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,960
I THINK THAT IS VERY

95
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,419
CONCERNING FOR THOSE OF US THAT
WORK IN THE MEDIA, AND WE ARE

96
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:19,339
PAID TO SAY STUFF ABOUT PEOPLE
AND SAY WE ATTACK SOMEONE FOR

97
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:21,430
WHATEVER REASON AND IT WASN'T
TAYLOR SWIFT, IT WAS ACTUALLY A

98
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,659
MORE SINISTER PERSON OR WHATEVER
AND THEN WE WERE APPROACHED WITH

99
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,520
ONE OF THE CEASE AND DESIST
LETTERS.

100
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,520
OUR ABILITY TO FIGHT

101
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,910
BACK IS MUCH MORE LIMITED THAN
THEIR ABILITY TO ATTACK US.

102
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,660
AND THE INTERESTING THING IS
THERE IS A THROUGH LINE BETWEEN

103
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,689
SEVERAL OF THE STORIES THAT WE
DISCUSSED TODAY, LIKE YOU

104
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:42,180
BROUGHT UP, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
DRAWING COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE

105
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:47,139
WAY THAT DISNEY, WEINSTEIN, AND
TAYLOR SWIFT'S LEGAL TEAMS HAVE

106
00:05:47,139 --> 00:00:00,000
COMMUNICATED WITH THE PRESS AS
OF LATE.
