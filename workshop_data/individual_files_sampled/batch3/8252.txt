DENUCLEARIZATION, ALL THE MURDERS AND STUFF, NOT SO MUCH. THE PRESIDENT SAID WE'LL BE DOING SOMETHING ON IT BUT HE DIDN'T ELABORATE. GENE CUMMINGS IS WITH US. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE PLIGHT OF HIS PEOPLE? WE DON'T KNOW A WHOLE LOT BECAUSE Shep: WAS OUR DESCRIPTION GENERALLY SPEAKING ACCURATE? FROM WHAT WE KNOW. WE KNOW FROM DEFECTORS WHAT THE CONDITIONS ARE OVER THERE. THE NUMBER OF DEFECTORS IN THE PAST YEAR GIVEN THE NEW RESTRICTIONS ON IMMIGRATION AND MIGRATION, THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS IMPOSED, THE NUMBER OF RECENT DEFECTORS IS DOWN TO TWO, LITERALLY TWO. Shep: TWO PEOPLE. TWO PEOPLE HAVE GAINED ACCESS TO THE UNITED STATES. THE NUMBERS ARE ALWAYS LOW. REGARD LOW. BUT THOSE DEFECTORS THAT HAVE COME IN HAVE DESCRIBED THE VERY KINDS OF CONDITIONS THAT YOUR TALKING ABOUT AND WHAT YOU DESCRIBED WAS IN A UNITED NATIONS REPORT IN RECENT YEARS. YES, THOSE ARE THE CONDITIONS THAT PEOPLE ARE ENDURING OVER THERE. THAT'S WHY SO MANY HUMAN RIGHTS ADVOCATES WANTED FOR THE PRESIDENT TO PUT THAT ISSUE ON THE TABLE IN A MORE ANIMATED WAY THAN IT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN. Shep: YOU MENTIONED THERE'S A RHETORICAL CARROT AND STICK ACTION HERE. YES. ONE OF THE THINGS WITH THE PRESIDENT, HE HAS A TENDENCY TO SOFTEN UP HIS TARGET WITH TOUGH RHETORIC AND THEN BRING THE PERSON TO THE TABLE WITH COMPLIMENTS. IT'S CARROTS AND STICKS. HE DID IT WITH MEXICO WHERE HE WAS VERY HARD ON THEM AND THEN TRIED TO BRING THEM INTO THE NAFTA NEGOTIATIONS. DIDN'T WORK THEN. WE'LL SEE IF THIS WORKS NOW. Shep: THIS JUXTAPOSITION OF THE BEATING UP OF OUR FRIENDS AND THE HUGGING OF OUR ENEMIES PHYSICALLY IS STRIKING AND FEELS HISTORICAL. I WONDER WHAT THE LENS OF HISTORY WILL DO TO IT ALL. ALL OF THIS WILL BE JUDGED BY HISTORY. WE'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO KNOW AT THE END OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WHAT KIND OF GRADE HE WILL GET IN THE HISTORY BOOKS. MUCH WILL DEPEND ON HOW NORTH KOREA EVOLVES AFTER THESE TALKS, AFTER ANY KIND OF AGREEMENT. YOU KNOW, THE SAME IS TRUE OF THE IRAQ WAR. WE CAN'T REALLY MEASURE IT UNTIL WE SEE WHAT BECOMES OF IRAQ. THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE HERE. IT DOES FEEL HISTORIC. IT'S A DIFFERENT APPROACH THAN WE'VE SEEN IN DECADES. MAYBE A DIFFERENT APPROACH IS WHAT WAS NEEDED. CERTAINLY THAT WAS THE ARGUMENT PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE ABOUT CUBA. WE'VE DONE IT ONE WAY FOR 30 YEARS. WHY NOT TRY SOMETHING. Shep: OF COURSE BEN RHODES WENT IN TO TALK TO CASTRO'S NEXT OF KIN 20 TIMES BEFORE PRESIDENT
