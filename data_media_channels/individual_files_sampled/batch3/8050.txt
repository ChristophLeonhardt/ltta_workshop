NOT JUST DEFENSE. Martha: FASCINATING. MARK PENN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE TONIGHT. THANK YOU. Martha: DULING EDITORIALS THIS EVENING. MY NEXT GUEST IS PRESIDENT TRUMP OVER HANDLING THIS PROBE. KIM STROSSEL WRITES THIS TRUMP CAN DEFINE THE TERMS OF THIS DEBATE AND DEFEND THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND HE CAN ENLIGHTEN THE COUNTRY. BUT IS TIME FOR DOING SO PRODUCTIVE SOLID GROWING VERY SHORT. "WALL STREET JOURNAL" COLUMNIST KIM STRASSEL JOINS US NOW. THANKS FOR BEING WITH US. HI, MARTHA. YOU SAY THEY HAVE TO APPROACH THIS FROM A CONSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE. EXPLAIN. WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT HOW THERE SEEMS TO BE NO THERE THERE ON THE COLLUSION QUESTION. THE HOUSE REPORT IS NOW OUT. BY ALL REPORTING MR. MUELLER HAS NOT FOUND ANYTHING THERE EITHER. SO THE REPORTS NOW SAY HE IS MOVING TO THE QUESTION OF OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. THAT REQUIRES AN ENTIRELY NEW LEGAL APPROACH, ONE THAT GOES RIGHT AT THAT CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION. BECAUSE YOU TALK TO ANY CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER, THEY WILL SAY THAT A PRESIDENT CANNOT BE CONSTRUED TO HAVE OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE WHILE HE WAS IN THE PROCESS OF ENGAGING IN CORE CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS. AND THAT INCLUDES FIRING SUBORDINATES AND DIRECTING LAW ENFORCEMENT LIKE MR. COMEY. Martha: YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS I FIND INTERESTING WE HAVEN'T HEARD DIRECTLY OBVIOUSLY FROM ROBERT MUELLER ON THIS. ONE OF HIS SPOKES PEOPLE SAID SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU READ ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING, DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE EVERYTHING THAT YOU READ, BECAUSE WE'RE NOT LEAKING ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THIS SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION. AND, YOU KNOW, ALSO SAID THEY WILL ISSUE AT THE END OF A REPORT. THAT IS WHAT THIS IS LEADING UP TO. THIS IS NOT LEADING UP TO SOME SORT OF INDICTMENT. IT'S LEADING UP TO MUELLER RELEASING A REPORT. PROBABLY ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT WE HEARD JAMES COMEY DO BACK IN JULY BEFORE THE ELECTION. TO SAY HERE'S WHAT I LOOKED AT. THIS KIND OF LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE ON DESTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. THIS LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE WHATEVER. YOU KNOW, NOBODY KNOWS WHAT HE IS GOING TO SAY. WHAT'S THE PROCESS THERE? I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO COME OUT OF THAT REPORT ONCE IT HITS THE AIR? WE HAVE NO IDEA BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY QUIET ON WHAT THAT REPORT WILL LOOK LIKE. BUT THIS IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR THE TRUMP TEAM TRUMP LAWYERS TO GO TO A FEDERAL COURT GET DECLARATORY JUDGMENT FROM THAT COURT THAT HOLDS THAT PRESIDENTS CANNOT BE HELD ON OBSTRUCTION WHEN EXERCISING CORE FUNCTIONS. YOU PUT THE SPECIAL COUNSEL ON NOTICE THAT THAT IS NOT AN AREA THAT HIS REPORT SHOULD GO BECAUSE IT'S NOT A CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION AND CAN YOU ALSO POTENTIALLY SHUT DOWN THIS DISCUSSION THAT IS EVERYWHERE IN THE PRESS AND AMONG DEMOCRATS AS WELL, TOO. BECAUSE IT'S BEGINNING TO IMPEDE ON OTHER PRESIDENTIAL ABILITIES LIKE IMPEACHMENT I'M SORRY, LIKE PARDONS. HE CAME OUT AND PARDONED SCOOTER LIBBY AND YOU HAVE ALL THESE DEMOCRATS SAYING THAT IS OBSTRUCTION. HE GIVES AN ORDER TO HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL. THEY SAY IT'S OBSTRUCTION. SO THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT JUST NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED ONE WIRT OTHER. Martha: ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW, FOLKS WHO ARE VERY KINDER THAT THERE WAS SOME SERIOUS WRONGDOING HERE ARE POINTING MOSTLY TO THE MICHAEL COHEN PART OF THE INVESTIGATION. THAT THESE RECORDINGS THAT ARE ON HIS SEVERAL CELL PHONES THAT HE HAD ARE LIKELY TO LEAD DOWN SOME ROAD THEY BELIEVE THAT WILL ENTRAP THE PRESIDENT IN SOME WRONGDOING. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT SEEMS TO BE VERY MUCH IN THE FOREFRONT IS THIS MEETING AT TRUMP TOWER. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED ABOUT THOSE SITUATIONS, HOW DOES THAT PLAY INTO HOW YOU SEE THE LARGER PICTURE HERE OR DOES IT? WELLING, THE MEETING AT TRUMP TOWER, IF YOU LOOK THROUGH THIS HOUSE
