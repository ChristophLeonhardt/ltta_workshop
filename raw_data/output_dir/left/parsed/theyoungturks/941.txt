Trump's rhetoric in response to China in
regard to China is very different
compared to his own personal business
with China even when it comes to his
current re-election campaign
so his re-election campaign of course is
gonna have campaign flags and all sorts
of stuff and it is currently being
manufactured in China and we have some
photos to prove it okay okay
no no look this is a guy whose slogan is
make America great again
mm-hmm this is the guy who says if you
don't do to make products in America I
will punish you like he said the
harley-davidson and he said over and
over again to different companies
without missing a beat because he does
not care about hypocrisy he just doesn't
care about it his own campaign slogans
for 2020 his banners are being made in
China
in fact they're now rushing orders to
America before the tariffs start yes
because then the signs will be more
expensive and they don't want more
expensive signs because they like buying
from China how could you not see the
massive hypocrisy if you were for if you
wear the red hats that say make America
great again and your whole thing was I
like Trump he's tough he's doing the
tariffs that'll show China we've got to
make a birthday job back home he's
shipping out is the banners first
campaign to China I look I guess if you
think I don't care man I just hate
Latinos and Muslims and mainly black
people too okay so I don't care where he
makes the things I don't care about any
of his slogans I don't care about
anything attached to reality as long as
he hates the same people
I hate I'm gonna vote for Trump I go
okay fair I get it okay but just admit
it
