>> THIS IS NOT ABOUT

16
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:25,253
IMMIGRATION.

17
00:00:25,253 --> 00:00:26,421
IT'S ABOUT HUMANITY.

18
00:00:26,421 --> 00:00:27,055
IT'S ABOUT FAMILY.

19
00:00:27,055 --> 00:00:29,958
IT'S ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A

20
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:31,225
COUNTRY.

21
00:00:31,225 --> 00:00:31,960

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ZERO-TOLERANCE

24
00:00:36,831 --> 00:00:38,032
IMMIGRATION POLICY.

25
00:00:38,032 --> 00:00:40,568
>> IT IS APPALLING.

26
00:00:40,568 --> 00:00:41,235
IT'S NOT AMERICAN.

27
00:00:41,235 --> 00:00:41,736
IT'S UNNECESSARY.

28
00:00:41,736 --> 00:00:44,038
>> IT IS ALSO NOT NEW.

29
00:00:44,038 --> 00:00:45,139
THE DECISION TO PROSECUTE ANY

30
00:00:45,139 --> 00:00:46,874

31
00:00:46,874 --> 00:00:48,843

PRESIDENT BUSH IN 2006.

34
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:52,647
>> THIS ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY IS

35
00:00:52,647 --> 00:00:54,983
INTENDED TO DETER PEOPLE FROM

36
00:00:54,983 --> 00:00:59,320
BREAKING THE LAW.

ADVOCATES CLAIM HELP REDUCE

ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.

40
00:01:10,198 --> 00:01:11,633
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MAKES

41
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:12,367
THE SAME CASE TODAY.

42
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:13,601

00:01:25,813 --> 00:01:26,581
ZERO-TOLERANCE WILL REDUCE

49
00:01:26,581 --> 00:01:26,881
FRAUD.

50
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:29,617
>> WE DO NOT HAVE THE LUXURY OF

51
00:01:29,617 --> 00:01:31,052
PRETENDING THAT ALL INDIVIDUALS

52
00:01:31,052 --> 00:01:33,321

USING CHILDREN TO POSE AS FAMILY

58
00:01:44,098 --> 00:01:46,467
INCREASED 315% THIS FISCAL YEAR,

59
00:01:46,467 --> 00:01:47,769
EXPLOITING A LOOPHOLE TO ESCAPE

60
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:49,203
DEPORTATION AND PROSECUTING

61
00:01:49,203 --> 00:01:50,104
THOSE CASES, THE DEPARTMENT

62
00:01:50,104 --> 00:01:53,408
SEPARATED SOME 1200 CHILDREN

63
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,910
FROM AN ADULT.

64
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,012
>> THE SMUGGLERS AND TRAFFICKERS

65
00:01:58,012 --> 00:01:59,447
KNOW THE LOOPHOLES BETTER THAN

66
00:01:59,447 --> 00:02:00,782
CONGRESS.

67
00:02:00,782 --> 00:02:01,349
>> CRITICS SAY TRUMPET

68
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:02,016
SEPARATING CHILDREN NOT TO

69
00:02:02,016 --> 00:02:03,584
CHANGE THE LAW BUT AS A

70
00:02:03,584 --> 00:02:04,686
BARGAINING CHIP TO FUND HIS

71
00:02:04,686 --> 00:02:04,986
WALL.

72
00:02:04,986 --> 00:02:08,723
>> HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE

73
00:02:08,723 --> 00:02:12,860
DON'T HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO WOULD

74
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,561
RESCIND THIS ZERO INHUMANITY

75
00:02:13,561 --> 00:02:16,698
POLICY IMMEDIATELY?

76
00:02:16,698 --> 00:02:18,433
>> MOMENTS AGO, THE

77
00:02:18,433 --> 00:02:20,068
ADMINISTRATION STRESSED THAT

78
00:02:20,068 --> 00:02:21,202
ENTERING THE U.S. WITHOUT

79
00:02:21,202 --> 00:02:23,237
PERMISSION IS A CRIME.

80
00:02:23,237 --> 00:02:25,173
BASICALLY, THE PROBLEM IS WHEN

81
00:02:25,173 --> 00:02:26,674
YOU DETAIN WOMEN AND CHILDREN,

82
00:02:26,674 --> 00:02:28,242
THE COURTS HAVE SAID THAT YOU

83
00:02:28,242 --> 00:02:31,279
HAVE TO RELEASE THEM WITHIN 20

84
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:32,013
DAYS THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATION

85
00:02:32,013 --> 00:02:32,714
WANTS CONGRESS TO CLOSE THE

86
00:02:32,714 --> 00:02:33,981
LOOPHOLE SO FAMILIES CAN STAY

87
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:35,249
TOGETHER.

88
00:02:35,249 --> 00:02:36,684
WHAT WE HEARD FROM DEMOCRATS

89
00:02:36,684 --> 00:02:37,452
TODAY IS THEY WANT TO BAN THE

90
00:02:37,452 --> 00:02:38,619
PRACTICE AND THEY BELIEVE

91
00:02:38,619 --> 00:00:00,000
FAMILIES SHOULD BE HANDLED
