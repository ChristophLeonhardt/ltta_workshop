DIVE AND SWIM THEIR WAY OUT. MAYBE SOMEDAY IT WILL BE TO IT'S A VERY COMPLEX QUESTION. ROE VERSUS WADE ARE THE ONE PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF HAVING AN EFFECT. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. BUT IT COULD VERY WELL END UP WITH STATES AT SOME POINT. Eric: THAT'S PRESIDENT TRUMP IN HIS EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH MARIA BARTIROMO SAYING HE IS NOT LIKELY TO ASK NOMINEES IF ELECTED HE WOULD APPOINT JUDGES WHO WOULD REVERSE AND PUT AN END TO THE HISTORIC ABORTION RULING. LEAVING MANY CONCERN ABOUT WHAT THIS OPEN SEAT COULD MEAN FOR WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE IS WITH EVENTUALLY BEING OVERTURNED OR DO YOU THINK THE SUPPORTERS WHO ARE THE PRO-CHOICE SUPPORTERS ARE UNJUSTIFIED IN THEIR FEARS? I HAVE A HOPE THAT'S BIGGER THAN ROE VERSUS WADE BEING OVERTURNED. IT TURNS IT BACK TO THE STATES. IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE LEGALITY OF ABORTION, IT JUST MEANS THAT DECISION WOULD BE LEFT TO THE STATES, WHICH FRANKLY, ERIC, IS WHERE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ANYWAY. THERE IS NO MENTION OF ABORTION OR WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS IN THE CONSTITUTION, WHICH IS THE LIMITATION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WHAT REALLY NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS A DISCUSSION ON PERSONHOOD. THE QUESTION IS NOT IS ABORTION OKAY OR NOT OKAY. THE QUESTION IS, IS THE UNBORN CHILD A PERSON? IF IT IS SO, AT WHAT POINT? IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN THAT THAT SHOULD BE INVOKED. THAT PERSON IS ENTITLED TO DUE PROCESS BEFORE HE OR SHE LOSES LIFE OR LIBERTY. THEY ARE TERMINATED IN LIFE AND LIBERTY BY THE SINGLE DECISION OF THE BIRTH MOTHER. THAT'S NOT PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF THOSE PERSONS. Sandra: GOVERNOR, THE PRESS SECRETARY, YOUR DAUGHTER, WAS EXACTLY IS THE PRESIDENT LOOKING FOR IN HIS SUPREME THE MAIN THING THE PRESIDENT IS LOOKING FOR ARE PEOPLE THAT FIT THE QUALIFICATIONS THAT YOU WOULD WANT IN A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, TREMENDOUS INTELLECT, SOMEONE WHO WILL STICK TO UPHOLDING THE CONSTITUTION AND SOMEBODY WHO HAS GREAT JUDICIAL TEMPERAMENT. THOSE ARE THE BIG THINGS THE PRESIDENT IS LOOKING FOR IN A CANDIDATE. Sandra: HE HAS A BIG JOB TO DO. THE WHITE HOUSE. IT'S A VERY SMART YOUNG LADY YOU JUST HAD ON. I THINK SHE IS SPOT ON WHEN IT I TELL PEOPLE ALL THE TIME I'M NOT INTERESTED IN THE APPOINTING A CONSERVATIVE JUSTICE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THE PERSON TO BE IDEOLOGICAL. I WANT HIM TO BE SOMEBODY WHO IS PURE TO THE ORIGINAL WORDS AND TEXT OF THE CONSTITUTION. IF A PERSON COMES WITH AN IDEOLOGICAL BENT LIBERAL OR CONSERVATIVE THEY WILL BE LOOKING AT THINGS AS IF TO LEGISLATE FROM THE COURTS. WE HAVE A LEGISLATIVE BODY CALLED CONGRESS. THE JUDICIAL BRANCH HAS NO RIGHT WHATSOEVER UNDER THE CONSTITUTION TO LEGISLATE ANYTHING TO ORIGINATE A LAW AND WE NEED SOMEBODY WHO WILL BE A I HOPE THE PRESIDENT STICKS TO THAT. I THINK HE WILL. I THINK THE NAMES ON HIS LIST ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMMITTED TO THAT. Eric: WHO JUMPS OUT AT YOU? INTERVIEWING HERE TODAY. ALL THE PEOPLE ON THE LIST HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL. I LIKE AMY CONEY BARRETT AS A POTENTIAL NOMINEE. I THINK SHE WOULD BE TERRIFIC. ANY ONE OF THESE PEOPLE. THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN VETTED AND LOOKED AT BY THEIR EXPERIENCE UP TO PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING EXCEPT THE FACT WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT THE DEMOCRATS WILL OPPOSE ANY PERSON THAT THE PRESIDENT PUTS FORWARD AND WHOEVER PUTS FORWARD I DO NOT ENVY THEM GOING INTO THAT LION'S DEN. THEY NEED TO GO INTO THE HEARING ROOM WITH A PISTOL, CHAIR AND WHIP. THEY'LL NEED IT WHEN THEY ARE FACING THOSE DEMOCRATS ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. Sandra: THE PRESS SECRETARY CONFIRMED BIG NEWS THAT MIKE POMPEO, THE PRESIDENT'S THE HOLIDAY, ON HIS WAY TO PYONGYANG TO MEET WITH NORTH KOREA. WHAT IS THE GOAL OF THE WHITE HOUSE HERE? THIS WILL BE THE THIRD TRIP FOR MIKE POMPEO TO THAT REGION. I DON'T HAVE ANY INSIDE INFORMATION SO I'M JUST PRESIDENT TOLD ME WHEN I INTERVIEWED HIM FOR A TELEVISION SHOW A WEEK AGO. HERE IS WHAT I THINK IS HAPPENING. THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THROUGH MIKE POMPEO TO THE NORTH KOREANS. YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO DENUCLEARIZE, EITHER YOU WILL DO IT OR YOU'RE NOT. IF YOU WON'T DO IT VOLUNTARILY WE'LL DO IT FOR YOU. IT WILL BE A VERY STERN AND SERIOUS MESSAGE THAT THIS IS NOT A GAME. WE ARE NOT THE OBAMA OR CLINTONS OR THE BUSHES. THIS IS AN ADMINISTRATION PREPARED TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO KEEP THAT PENINSULA AS LONG AS NORTH KOREA IS DEVELOPING NUCLEAR WEAPONS. I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE WILL BE SAYING TO KIM JONG-UN. Eric: WHAT IF THERE IS NO TIMETABLE, KIM JONG-UN DOES NOT PROVIDE THE INFORMATION? WHAT DO WE DO THEN? WATCH AND TELLS HIM THE TIME IS TICKING. BEFORE THE BATTERY RUNS OUT HE BETTER HAVE THINGS UNDERWAY WE AREN'T GOING TO LET THIS EXTEND INTO THE TERM OF ANOTHER PRESIDENT IN ANOTHER 6 1/2 ABOUT IT. IF HE IS NOT BUCKLE UP AND GET READY. THERE WILL BE SERIOUS REPERCUSSIONS INCLUDING MILITARY REPERCUSSIONS. WE'VE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD BEFORE. I DON'T TRUST FOR HIM THAT THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE DOES BUT HERE IS WHAT I KNOW. IF HE IS AS SMART AS THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES HIM TO BE, IF HE IS THAT PERCEPTIVE HE WILL PICK UP ON THE FACT THIS IS A PRESIDENT NOT AFRAID TO DO WHAT HE SAYS. ONE THING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP THAT EVEN HIS ENEMIES WOULD HAVE TO ACCEPT, HE IS A PERSON THAT ENDS UP DOING WHAT HE JERUSALEM, WHETHER IT'S TAX CUTS, WHETHER IT'S ENFORCING THE BORDER. THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO WHEN HE SAYS SOMETHING ENDS UP DOING IT. THAT'S THE BIGGEST SHOCK TO THE POLITICAL WORLD. HE IS NOT KIDDING AND MAYBE THEY ARE GETTING THAT MESSAGE. THE PRESIDENT IS AHEAD OF US. Sandra: HE HAS MORE INTERVIEWS ON HIS PLATE THIS WEEK. I'LL END WITH THIS. THE PRESIDENT TWEETING A LOT THIS MORNING ON NORTH KOREA HE TALKS ABOUT THE MANY GOOD CONVERSATIONS THAT HE IS HAVING WITH NORTH KOREA GOING WELL, MEANTIME NO ROCKET LAUNCHES OR NUCLEAR TESTING IN EIGHT MONTHS. ALL OF ASIA IS THRILLED. ONLY THE OPPOSITION PARTY INCLUDING THE FAKE NEWS IS COMPLAINING. IF NOT FOR ME WE WOULD NOW BE AT WAR WITH NORTH KOREA. ARE WE A LONG WAY FROM WHERE WE WERE JUST SEVERAL MONTHS AGO BEFORE THE SUMMIT EVER TOOK PLACE? WELL, WE CLEARLY ARE. YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT THE ROCKET'S RED GLARE OVER THE PENINSULA RIGHT NOW. THAT'S A GOOD STEP. WE'RE NOT WHERE WE NEED TO BE. THE SECRETARY OF STATE WILL CONVEY THAT WHEN HE FACES KIM JONG-UN PERSONALLY. YES, WE'RE BETTER OFF. JUST HAVING CONVERSATION IS BETTER OFF. GETTING SOME CONCESSIONS. NOW THEY HAVE TO LIVE UP TO IT. I THINK LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY, THEY WILL HAVE HELL TO PAY IF THEY DON'T. Eric: ARE THOSE SARAH'S BABY PICTURES OVER YOUR RIGHT SHOULDER OR GRANDCHILDREN? SOME OF THEM ARE SARAH'S BABY PICTURES, SOME ARE MY SONS. MY HOUSE AND OFFICE ARE FILLED WITH PICTURES OF SIX GRANDKIDS WHO HAPPEN TO BE OBJECTIVELY SPEAKING THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GRANDCHILDREN IN THE WORLD,
