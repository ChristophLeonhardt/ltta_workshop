hello everyone my name is Matthew
McKenna and welcome back to my channel
today we're going to be doing another
one OK ROCK video I did like a part one
where I listened to a bunch of their
songs mostly studio versions like music
videos and stuff like that and today
we're going to be venturing into some
other stuff because we're listening to
different songs but also live versions I
don't think I've ever like specifically
done a live video reaction before so
this is the first and I'm pretty excited
and it's something that a lot of you
requested before we start though if
you're new here make sure you click

get notified any time I upload a video
first one we're listening to is called
mighty long fall which was performed at
Yokohama Stadium Wow very powerful drum
straight off the bat I dig it I don't
know if you people know this but I have
actually been playing drums for like 10
years so like nice engaging drum starts
is an easy way to get me hooked
always always a great sign when a band
sounds good live as well as in the
studio they've definitely got real
talent
wow what a crowd also pyrotechnics I
don't think pyrotechnics have ever liked
not been impressive work in that stage
what a killer outfit too
kind of feels like I'm listening to some
like early to mid-2000s rock and I dig
it who's genuinely bit frightening
I love love love seeing crowds get into
performances like this like the bounce
Wow that wasn't particularly a hard note
to hit not really like up there anything
but sustaining it so well like that is
impressive especially alive and
especially like halfway through a song
I'm so into this song right now I don't
really know what it is or what it's
about but just the the sound of it I'm
like yeah this is the kind of stuff I
listen to ever needed to get pumped up
for something I'm like hi I'm sitting
here I'm like why am I sitting down I
need I need to be I need to be dancing I
don't know why he's shirtless though
that guy I mean you know you do you boo
I felt that ending there felt a little
bit heavier than the other stuff time
listen to this is like actually what I
used to listen to as a teenager no lie
that was a very good first impression as
to what their lack is a live band so
really came here the next song now which
is going to be called dream up
Wow he's hyping them up like crazy nice
I'm always impressed by that because
it's like no small feat to get a crowd
to get pumped up like that I don't know
why that amuses me just there running
I'll have you know it's it's very hard
to mime running while sitting down
especially that's the best I can do yeah
get rid of that you don't need that
jacket thanks again serious
literally I used to listen to exactly
this stuff when I was a team I really
wish that I discovered these guys like
eight years ago I would be so into them
gonna be all I'd be listening to now
I've become like an old fart that
listens to in deep hips that trash am i
like a new level of hipster for
acknowledging that I'm hipster
well when the lights went on you really
saw how huge that crowd was they're big
there's something just mind-blowing and
amazing about seeing so many people in
the same place to watch just like one
artist it's just amazing to me
I love this breakdown
I'm firket also ladies and gentlemen
I just love that they're going down the
catwalk now like it's not just one of
them here it's all of these all the band
members other than the drummer of course
like he's not gonna pick up his drums
and walk down the stage they are just
like absolutely owning this crowd right
now he's just
rock-starring it up right now
Big Finish as always
I've seen these thoughts of finishes a
lot in live shows and it's always a good
way to rile up a crowd
nice
so far they've they've quite impressed
me with their their onstage abilities
and really their control of the stage in
the crowd it's it's very impressive and
it's not as easy as people think this
looks a bit older oh wow what a small
intimate crowd oh wait was that is that
a crowd or is it a choir
oh I think it's a choir
that's cool
hey the subtitles
so where's the crowd oh they are down
acquired they're the crowd ohh ohh
the crowd was just so into it that they
were singing the start and the guy okay
I'm with it I understand now
Wow why does this crowd sound so good
they legit sound like a choir I was
convinced for a second than they were
just a choir there so in time and in
tune it's amazing whoa
I love his drum set my god that's
gorgeous
oh that's so beautiful how does he do
those spins without just getting
insanely busy I do like one spin and I'm
like I'm gonna fall over he's moved to
tears that's adorable I pull those like
silly faces when I drum - I don't know
it was like intentional but though
that's about to me as well bring it on
home and bring it home big now come on
oh it's like a breakdown oh my gosh
let's go to feel amazing as a band right
or any honest
well even this just gave me like a
shiver down my spine geez
what a performance
honestly that was Sookie so solo it's so
well done the crowd control was
incredible the crowd was incredible
that's the kind of thing you see a band
pull a performance like that and you're
like yeah they definitely go on places
hot let's move on to the very last one
we're gonna listen to which is no scared
I have to say going from the last
performance this one is a bit flawed
also I should say that I think the last
song that we listened to is probably the
favorite I've listened to out of these
so far and judging by this song still
probably my favorite compared to this
one
such intense eyes my gosh
I feel like we've come totally full
circle huh like more and more often this
sort of stuff is becoming way way
popular like we've gone through several
phases and it's come back to like pop
punk bands killing it this dude has like
the most beautiful drum sets just makes
me so jealous
I don't really have anything to say to
that other than just like Wow
honestly like well I do enjoy their
music I never really imagined myself
listening to their studio versions being
like yeah I'd love to see these guys in
concert but watching these videos I'm
like wow they put on a shower and now
I'm thinking maybe when maybe it would
be pretty cool to go to one of these
shows I don't I don't really go out that
much so that's that's saying something
we didn't get to hear the final drums
overall like honestly very impressed as
I've said quite a few times doing all
that and pulling off really well is no
small feat and it's always really
amazing and impressive to me to see
someone just be able to absolutely own a
stage like that I mean I say someone all
of them obviously own the stage but and
you're like the frontman of the band
especially when there's instrumental
breaks and you're not singing it's very
very hard to like keep energy I guess is
what I'm going for and a lot of people
end up looking kind of awkward during
these instrumental bits on stage but at
no point that I think any of them looked
awkward and overall I really enjoyed
watching that so with all that said I
would love to hear your thoughts what do
you think you disagree with anything
I've said or do just agree with me have
you actually been to any of their live
shows cuz if so I would love to hear
what it was like tell me your story
so thank you very much for watching I
hope you enjoyed the video don't forget
to hit that like button and as always
have an awesome time until I see you
next see ya
