1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:04,450
RECENTLY DONALD TRUMP TOOK TO
TWITTER TO SHARE HOW OUTRAGED HE

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,529
IS IN REGARD TO THE RUSSIA
PROBE, AND FOR THE FIRST TIME HE

3
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:11,880
HASN'T KNOWLEDGED THAT HE IS
BEING PERSONALLY INVESTIGATED AS

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,060
A RESULT OF THIS CASE.

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,650
IN FACT
HE'S BEING INVESTIGATED FOR

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,610
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, MOSTLY
BECAUSE OF HIS OWN DOING AND

7
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:37,800
BECAUSE OF THE FACT HE DECIDED
TO FIRE JAMES COMEY.

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:48,989
NOW --

9
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:59,280
NOW --

10
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,809
KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE IS A
LITTLE BIT OF A CONFLICT IN

11
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:09,610
TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT DONALD
TRUMP WAS ACTUALLY ENCOURAGED OR

12
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:14,180
ADVISED TO FIRE COMEY BY JEFF
SESSIONS AND ALSO ROD

13
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,880
ROSENSTEIN.

14
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,390
AND IF THAT'S THE
CASE, THEY COULD ALSO BE

15
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,330
INVESTIGATED FOR OBSTRUCTION OF
JUSTICE.

16
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,330
IF THEY TOLD HIM TO

17
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:26,380
FIRE COMEY THEY ARE ALSO
IMPLICATED IN THIS CASE.

18
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,240
ROSENSTEIN RELEASED A STATEMENT
ABOUT THIS, HE SAID --

19
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:47,549
ALSO, THIS IS SPECULATION,
THIS IS MY TAKE, THIS IS NOT

20
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,420
FACT, OR HASN'T BEEN CONFIRMED,
BUT I JUST GET THE SENSE THAT

21
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:58,670
MUELLER IS LIKE, DUDE, I DON'T
WANT TO DO THIS ANYMORE, FINE,

22
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,670
I'M RECUSED.

23
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,159
THAT ROSENSTEIN DOESN'T WANT
TO DO IT ANYMORE.

24
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,159
YES.

25
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,369
HERE'S THE INTERESTING
THING, TRUMP STARTS TWEETING

26
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:07,530
ABOUT IT, OF COURSE HE'S
OUTRAGED, HE SAYS --

27
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:16,529
SO IT IS UNCLEAR WHO IS
TALKING ABOUT.

28
00:02:16,529 --> 00:02:17,529
IS HE TALKING

29
00:02:17,529 --> 00:02:18,529
ABOUT SESSIONS?

30
00:02:18,529 --> 00:02:19,529
ROSENSTEIN?

31
00:02:19,529 --> 00:02:20,529
HE'S TALKING ABOUT ROSENSTEIN.

32
00:02:20,529 --> 00:02:26,749
WE ARE ASSUMING HE'S TALKING
ABOUT ROSENSTEIN, TALKING POINTS

33
00:02:26,749 --> 00:02:39,749
MEMO WRITES --

34
00:02:39,749 --> 00:02:44,139
BUT IT'S ALL SUPER
QUESTIONABLE BECAUSE IF YOU CAN

35
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:47,409
REMEMBER, DURING AN INTERVIEW,
TRUMP SAID THIS --

36
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:52,989
LOOK, HE'S A SHOW BOAT, HE'S A
GRANDSTANDER, THE FBI HAS BEEN

37
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:56,919
IN TURMOIL, YOU KNOW THAT, I
KNOW THAT, EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

38
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:01,760
WHAT I DID IS I WAS GOING TO
FIRE COMEY, MY DECISION.

39
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,299
YOU MADE THE DECISION BEFORE
THEY CAME IN?

40
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:05,879
I WAS GOING TO FIRE COMEY.

41
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,810
THERE'S NO GOOD TIME TO DO IT,
BY THE WAY.

42
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,629
IN YOUR LETTER YOU SAID I
ACCEPTED THE RECOMMENDATION.

43
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:13,629
YOU MADE THE DECISION?

44
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:15,959
I WAS GOING TO FIRE HIM
REGARDLESS OF RECOMMENDATIONS.

45
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:22,159
YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO DO
IT UNILATERALLY, AND THEN

46
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,329
FAST-FORWARD TO TODAY, I'M BEING
INVESTIGATED FOR FIRING THE FBI

47
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:29,959
DIRECTOR BY THE MAN WHO TOLD ME
TO FIRE THE FBI DIRECTOR.

48
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,669
YOU ARE A CLOWN.

49
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,530
ROSENSTEIN NEEDS TO LEAVE.

50
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,360
HE
GOT USED WHEN HE WROTE THAT MEMO

51
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,309
THAT HE SHOULD'VE REFUSED TO
WRITE, BUT WHEN HE AGREED TO

52
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:43,589
WRITE IT, IF HE DIDN'T REALIZE
THERE WAS A REASON WHY THEY

53
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:47,379
WANTED YOU TO WRITE THE MEMO,
IT'S SO WHETHER TRUMP THEN MADE

54
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:51,109
A MISTAKE AND I THINK THE PLAN
BY BECAUSE HE CAN'T HELP HIMSELF

55
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:55,401
BY GOING ON WITH LESTER HOLT AND
ADMITTING, NO, IT WAS MY

56
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:59,869
DECISION AND I WAS I WAS GOING
TO DO IT, BUT STILL EVEN NOW

57
00:03:59,869 --> 00:04:01,790
THEY CAN ALWAYS REFER BACK, HE
COULD SAY I WAS GOING TO DO IT

58
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,189
BUT I GOT BOTH JEFF SESSIONS,
WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE ALREADY

59
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:08,419
RECUSED HIMSELF, AND ROD
ROSENSTEIN WROTE THIS MEMO.

60
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:09,419
HE

61
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:12,049
GOT PLAYED, HE ALLEGEDLY HAS
THIS REPUTATION FOR BEING

62
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:16,918
ROSENSTEIN DOES BEING A SERIOUS
BIPARTISAN YOU KNOW HE'S A

63
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:19,929
PROFESSIONAL, THAT WAS THE IMAGE
WE WERE -- BUT A PROFESSIONAL

64
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,090
DOESN'T ALLOW HIMSELF TO GET
USED LIKE THAT, AND QUITTING NOW

65
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,770
AGAIN WOULD SERVE HIM WELL.

66
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,450
BUT
I SEE NO INDICATION THAT HE WILL

67
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,450
DO THAT.

68
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,800
EVERYONE IN AMERICA
SHOULD GET FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH

69
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,500
THE NAME RACHEL BRAND, SHE'S THE
THIRD IN COMMAND AT THE JUSTICE

70
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,669
DEPARTMENT, AND WHEN ROSENSTEIN
RECUSES HIMSELF, AND SINCE TRUMP

71
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:41,650
HAD A CONVERSATION WITH HIM
WHERE HE ASKED HIM TO WRITE THIS

72
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,630
MEMO OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD APPEAR
THAT THAT WOULD BE PART OF

73
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:49,819
MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION, WHAT
WAS THAT CONVERSATION LIKE?

74
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:50,819
WHAT

75
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:51,819
WAS YOUR CONVERSATION WITH THE
PRESIDENT?

76
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:52,819
THAT MAKES YOU

77
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:58,860
INVOLVED IN THE INVESTIGATION,
NOT THE TARGET OF IT, SO MY

78
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,740
HUNCH IS ROSENSTEIN WILL HAVE TO
RECUSE HIMSELF AND RACHEL BRAND

79
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,819
WILL BE THE PERSON WHO
ULTIMATELY TRUMP PRESSURES TO

80
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:05,590
FIRE ROBERT MUELLER.

81
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,590
AND

82
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,340
THEN ULTIMATELY SHE WILL HAVE TO
RECUSE HERSELF IN SOME WAY.

83
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,909
SHE JUST GOT HERE, MAYBE SHE
WON'T.

84
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:14,940
IF EVERYONE INVOLVED IN RUSSIA
HAD TO RECUSE THEMSELVES WE

85
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,370
WOULD HAVE NO GOVERNMENT.

86
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:21,979
BUT
THE MOST INSANE THING ABOUT THIS

87
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:26,129
IS IN ORDER TO COMMUNICATE WITH
THE PRESIDENT, WE HAVE TO TRY TO

88
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:28,259
INTERPRET HIS TWEETS.

89
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:29,530
IT'S ABSURD.

90
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,259
THAT IS LIKE TALKING TO A
14-YEAR-OLD GIRL, LIKE, WHAT DID

91
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:34,460
THAT WE REALLY MEAN?

92
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,699
DON'T INSULT 14-YEAR-OLD
GIRLS.

93
00:05:35,699 --> 00:00:00,000
WELL, THEIR HANDS ARE ABOUT
THE SAME SIZE.
