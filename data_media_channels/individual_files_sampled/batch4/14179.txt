I was tried in what can only be described as a kangaroo court the first night down there there was a prisoner called carne who sailed straight away there's a price up for me I'm taken straight down to the block for the first week I didn't a single thing my son cried every day for two month which we believe I'll be back in prison so I've sacrificed my life tomorrow to bring the changes needed this isn't about my kids yeah this bow is about every single child if there's gonna be about the letter B being on my son
