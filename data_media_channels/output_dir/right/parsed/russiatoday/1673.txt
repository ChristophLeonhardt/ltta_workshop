obviously during the parade itself on
Red Square access rules behavioral rules
are super strict but this is just a
rehearsal so we can hang out here a
little bit and have a bit of fun one of
the brand new things about this year's
parade is that it's gonna feature drones
and I think I can see one right there
oh I think I can see someone from last
year's parade
we searched the stores dish actually I
have some tank driving skills myself
here we go we're let's see if I can do
something with that here
by saving you catchin up with me
everyone's way too serious but perhaps
that's what you should expect really
with this kind of event
okay we really have to go now
what can you sign your lease well no one
allowed me to drive today but the man in
charge just told me that I can use the
hatch to and stand up
I've got no roof now that we parked just
outside Red Square unfortunately we will
have to leave and it's time for the guys
to do some military-grade washing up
