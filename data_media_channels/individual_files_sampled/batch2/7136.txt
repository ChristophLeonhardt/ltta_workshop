Paul Manafort has officially been indicted for shady dealings with Russia and we are now learning about what he spent some of his laundered money on and the details are rather juicy and pretty outrageous so the indictment said that man affort laundered more than eighteen million dollars through offshore accounts and used the money to enjoy a lavish lifestyle here in the United States well what did that lavish lifestyle entail a lot of money on clothing and antique rugs so let me give you some examples so he reportedly spent 1.3 1 million dollars on home automation lighting and home entertainment company in Florida so I'm guessing home automation is like shot like shades and stuff that you guys I don't even know what that means but it sounds ridiculous look there's only two options here when I first read it I thought man this guy's obsessed with this house he also spent 5.4 3 million dollars on home improvement company in Hamptons and then there's a six hundred fifty five thousand dollars on a landscaper of the Hamptons and another hundred sixty four thousand another landscaper he must have a gorgeous house he has several homes that he used his laundered money on but just to finish the thought there it's either like he's wasting the money and I think that's so like what do you did all that you know you're gonna go to prison and all that for just a you gotta have that automation automated lighting in your house and that might be part of the thing and he's an idiot another possibility I don't know I don't know we're gonna have to see as the case unfolds Azizi funneling things through these companies is it more money laundering because it is an ungodly sum to spend on even lavish houses okay so let me give you a couple more examples that will amaze you so he spent more than half a million dollars on a clothing store in Beverly Hills just one clothing store $520,000 one clothing store he also spent twenty thousand dollars on housekeeping in New York and he wired money from his offshore accounts to purchase two properties in New York City and a third in Arlington Virginia now look some of it I get like if you're gonna they're stealing money or money laundering or whatever you did with the Russian oligarch says the indictment charges well you might as well get nice houses and Range Rovers and Mercedes out of it which is what he did he likes art he bought art the twenty thousand on housekeeping seems benign next to everything else so I get that part but why you have to spend a combined 7 million dollars or more to improve your houses how much improvement do you need in a house and then eight hundred and forty nine thousand dollars at another men's clothing store in New York and then nine hundred thirty four thousand dollars at an antique rug store in Alexandria yeah and so he's obviously in incredibly vain because I doubt that the random store in Beverly Hills in New York we're doing money laundering for him I don't know we'll see right but that's what you stole the money for you know that's that's the thing that drives me crazy about these guys who get obsessed with material things man how come people aren't obsessed with like being able to sleep at night right like it's like peace of mind knowing that you earned an honest living yeah you're not gonna be able to afford I don't even know how much for an antique rug but who cares who cares you step on a rug you step on it with your dirty ass feet okay my dog sometimes does wee-wee on it like pee pee on it or whatever like on accident like we clean it up it's fine it's good but like I would like lose my mind if I had this like million dollar rug or however much she spends money on for these rugs like it's just stupid it's stupid you know what's priceless piece of mind being able to sleep at night and not worry about you know the feds coming after me because I'm laundering money and doing all these shady dealings with with Russians but but you see why the country is so sick of the corruption and the greed in Washington so I mean this guy not only it is now facing incredible prison time you know for his dealings here with the money laundering and avoiding taxes that are with the Russian oligarchs but he bothered to do deals with the Russian oligarchs to get stupid and key bugs and then on top of that in one of the parts of the night monied explains that he stiffed one of the oligarchs and when he did he took about eighteen point nine million dollars off the guy and then never returned his calls he went on the Trump campaign to make it whole with him in other words he was gonna do the Russians favors through Trump in order to pay back the 19 million dollars he spent on automated lighting and antique rugs you sold out the country for like designer clothes and antique rugs your greed is despicable and vomitus that's why we can't this is the swamp this is a swamp it was working for Trump and just to be clear he spent nine hundred thirty four thousand dollars on one antique rug Oh one what Reich a hundred and twelve thousand dollars on audio-video and control system home integration so that you could listen to whatever you listened to slightly better slightly better you sold out the whole country I hope with the rugs and the clothes and the slightly better lighting and audio visuals in your home was worth it and and I hope you get enough prison time for us to think it was worth it if you like this video you'll love the whole TYT Network check it out at TYT Network comm slash join
