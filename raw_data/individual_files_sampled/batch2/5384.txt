one's the factor a bunting of our what you're asking about is the assault weapons ban yes sir so let me be honest with you about that one if I believe that that law would have prevented this from happening I would support it but I want to explain to you why it would not senator Rubio my daughter running down the hallway at Margaret Evelyn Douglas were shot in the back yes with an assault weapon the weapon of choice yes okay it is too easy to get it is a weapon of war the fact that you can't skin with everybody in this building and say that I'm sorry that was Fred Guttenberg the father of 14 year-old Jamie Guttenberg who was killed in last week's school shooting in Florida it's the top of the hour here on Morning Joe and joining us now from parkland Florida is Fred Guttenberg right I don't know how you're doing this but we thank you for those out there who still don't get it who still don't think that change needs to happen immediately can you please describe what it's like in your house right now my house is broken and honestly I don't know how we fix it my daughter and anyone who knew her will tell you this was the energy everywhere she went she she created the laughter in our house she was silly with us she was silly with her friends she was someone who brought buzz where she went and she was tough my house I mean and honestly Mike and Joe morning Joe was ritual in my house and in the mornings my kids knew when you guys were on they knew when one of you was absent my daughter is no longer walking in and asking me you know what are they talking about today my house is forever changed and and because she got hunted at school these kids and I'm standing here at a park with this amazing memorial that this community put together they got hunted it I don't want to hear people talk about oh they got shot they got hunted with the only weapon that could do it you can't drive a car through school hallways can't be a weapon of choice a knife I can assure you my daughter was the toughest person I knew she would have ran from that and one I am aware of the video in the hallways at this school they've seen what happened to my daughter running down the hall running for her life my daughter knew what was about to happen and she took a shot through the back single shot severing her spinal cord done dead III I am shocked to my core I can't bring her back but these amazing kids in this amazing community I can only say people messed with the wrong people we're we're not letting this go our children need to be able to go to school all I did on Valentine's Day a day of love my wife's favorite holiday all that I did is I sent my kid to school she doesn't come home to us my brother I'm sorry my son he lost his sister the first night he came down crying he's an only brother now you know it's it's unacceptable this can't happen to another family and I apologize if I'm rambling but it's just been that kind of a week no no you're not rambling you're not Fred you know I can't I can't tell you looking at the pictures and hearing you talking about your daughter how closely that hits home to me because my daughter's the same age I can't imagine what you're going through we sit and talk all the time about her future and what she's going to do and I just want you just for a minute uh as long as you want to take tell us tell us about Jamie tell us what she wanted to do with her life tell us what motivated her and and and tell us what you and your wife saw on her that everybody watching this Shona this country needs to know we lost as a country Florida lost as a state and you lost as a father well my my daughter remember once you she was a great daughter and a great sister she was tough as nails my daughter is standing on my shoulder pushing me forward through this because in my home the philosophy was you always do what's right no matter how hard it is but my daughter was tough but she was also fun she made people laugh her craziness sometimes she made them cry too but everywhere she went people knew her and loved being with her because she was the life of the party she was she was the energy in the room my daughter she was only 14 she was a baby you know when when she was born my son when he was born he was he was a relatively he was quiet when he was born and he's always been kind of chill my daughter came out screaming yeah 20 minutes 30 minutes an hour later she was still scream and I looked at my wife and I said this one's not like the other one and that she never was she was always vocal and had to be heard but at this age of 14 she knew what she wanted out of her life she loved her dance community and dance was always going to be a part of her life but she also was tough and stood up for kids who others bullied she was part of the Best Buddies program she was part of something called the friendship initiative which is a program down here that works with kids who have special needs and she volunteered her spare moments doing that my daughter when she grew up knew she wanted to be married and have a kid by 25 she knew she wanted to be a physical therapist working for a local place down here called the Paley Institute which is for kids with limb deformities this world lost my kid who had her life figured out at 14 who had such a strong head on her shoulders that nothing could take that away until something did my daughter is lost this community has lost 16 other amazing people because they were hunted at school thread we were all riveted by what happened last night what would you like Marco Rubio senator Rubio senator Nelson not only the governor who didn't show up last night he I think shamefully sure but of course the state of Florida is going to be electing another governor this year yep what do you need them to do so when you look back you can say that along with the parents who lost their children at Sandy Hook along with those that lost their loved ones in Orlando that you can say there's a hole in my heart that will never be filled but she didn't die in vain what do you need yeah you know and I'm glad you asked that question because from from I guess a policy standpoint people have been sending me things all week to read and look at and I've just refused to look at any of it I'm going on adrenaline here but but here is what I need I and and I said last night to senator Rubio I'm just a brutally honest person for better or for worse and the truth is if they stand with us and do the right thing I'm gonna throw my arms around him and tell him I love him and I'll do it to all the others as well I need them to be honest I need them to say the truth which is these kids these teachers they were killed by a weapon of war in their school these weapons of war need to be removed from the streets okay my heart is big because of friends of mine who have been lifelong NRA members who are sending me pictures of their cut-up NRA cards and it needs to start there these politicians need to stop doing the wrong thing because of money that they are receiving from that group some people stay out the NRA I stand with MS D which is Marjory Stoneman Douglas we need to take these weapons out of the hands of anyone and we certainly need to deal with the mental health issues that are part of this whole process but the problem is there's only one weapon that can cause this kind of destruction in a school that is supposed to be secure which gets to the next thing we need to do we need to make schools more secure it just shouldn't be that easy to get on to a school property it shouldn't be this easy to keep on doing this we need to have funding for more security in the schools what we do not need and I and I and I I will tell you I heard the little sit down yesterday at the Oval Office and I went out last night enraged we do not need to start throwing more guns in the hands of teachers and students at school knowing what took place better than everyone who might have some opinions on this or most people it was pandemonium people were running all over the place you cannot have shootouts in the hallways of a school you can't it doesn't save lives it will lead to the loss of additional lives we need to have more security we need to have more protection around the schools we need to make it impossible for people to get those guns you know you go to the pharmacy to pick up a prescription in many cases it's going to be hard then it was for this person to get the gun that was used to hunt these people I I don't understand how someone can't agree with me that's a problem we've been trying to talk about it here on the set but it might be better coming from you but when someone from the NRA or a member of the NRA says that assault weapons are their god-given right it's the right to bear arms what do you say my daughter had rights more than just the Second Amendment they've all been terminated okay that's what I say I'm a believer in the Second Amendment assault weapons are simply allowed through a bastardized interpretation of what the Second Amendment is okay and I say we need to be real we need to be realistic I wanted my kid to live out all of her rights I sent my son out to go shooting with his grandfather about a month ago I have no issue with any of that but we shouldn't put in place a process that makes it so easy through some bastardized interpretation to get these weapons I'm sorry there's there's dig to the core of my being I just can't agree let me ask you about also law enforcement I apologize for my language I'm sorry no I your languages is it's certainly fine and we all understand it let me ask about law enforcement as well the president talked about in enhanced background checks marco rubio that brought that up last night that is a change even after las vegas even after newtown even after everything else absolutely but what about law enforcement what about we've heard about the FBI missing and you talked about this last night missing a warning but also you had local law enforcement officers being called to the shooters house something like 30 35 times over the past couple of years and somehow the guy still be still able first of all they don't move on him secondly I guess we needed four people from Florida like you and me we understand about the Baker Act we need to toughen up the Baker Act to keep guns away from people that are mentally ill but but what do we do on background check what do you think about the fact that law enforcement officers were warned all of these times and this guy could cysteine ager troubled teenager could still walk into a store and get an ar-15 I'm glad you asked that and first things first law enforcement in the past week from the day of the shooting and even knowing many members of local law enforcement I just wanna on TV brat my arms around you all and give you a big hug they have given me strength they have been unbelievable they have been everywhere they have done everything that they can do they have they have they have been the backbone of our community for the past week and I am thankful for them as for what happened prior to the shooting I actually think we need to look at the laws that make it very difficult for law enforcement to go out on these tips and not be able to do anything about it because they were following the law okay so I don't blame law enforcement for it I say I blame the laws we have in place and we need to immediately do something about that as for the FBI the morning that I was planning my daughter's funeral I was sitting with the funeral director when I got a call from the FBI telling me that it was about to be public about their mistake I've had proper protocol been followed this person would have been apprehended by them in January if I understood their mistake correctly because I was in a pretty confused place at the time if I understood that correctly somebody needs to be fired somebody's or maybe we need to look at the process that led to the breakdown and close that hole immediately because if in fact that is correct that this person should have been apprehended back in January and this could have been avoided I hope somebody is it is deeply digging into what took place in that breakdown and fixing it because we can't have this again Fred you say you're running on a adrenaline and you're a voice on this is crystal clear I'm wondering how your wife jen is doing how is she gonna get through this we start our a day at the cemetery that's what we do now my wife lost her a baby on her favorite holiday of the year okay my wife will get through this because we're a strong family my son will get through this but my wife is heartbroken we cry a lot we look at pictures and talk a lot we haven't walked into my daughter's room yet my wife is gonna be okay because because I know who we are but it's not gonna be easy it's gonna take a while to to just add to this my wife is the most intensely private person you'll ever meet so to have this happen in the way that it did and to have what's going on here going on adds insult to injury but in in spite of her intensely private way of being she also understands the mission that I am determined to take on I am and I and I will not stop I'm going to be relentless this can't happen again and while she's private she supports me and and we meet that's where we're at right now it's sort of day by day we're gonna figure this out you know Fred I'm looking behind you at that memorial and it reminds me of what I saw Sandy Hook over five years ago I would go up there very early in the morning but before anybody was up actually and I kept going up there and I took a picture of 20 roses that were frozen late December and I've kept it on my wall for five years thinking that somehow someway we had to stop this from happening again that was over five years ago and now I'm looking behind you at a memorial that looks about the same as what I saw in Sandy Hook with all those broken hearts with people swearing never again how how it's done believable how do you what hope do you have that I won't be calling you on this show five years from now to talk about the fight against these weapons of war and this culture and you won't be consoling a father just like you who lost their fourteen-year-old daughter what what hope do you have that this can stop a week ago my soul was shattered this week because of people reaching out stepping up my hope is restored because of the kids who a week ago I had my concerns over because we know they live in their cell phones these kids have restored my faith they have been unbelievable they have been strong they have been fierce these kids are my hope these kids won't stop these kids simply want to go to school and here's the thing unlike in past shootings these kids are at an age where they can verbalize it and fight and this shooting was caught on video the cell phones came out you can't hide from what happened and because of that and the fight in these kids and the fight and me I I have hope I think this time was different and I think we're going to get something done we may not happen tomorrow it should but it's going to happen all right Fred we're with you listen thank you please please tell your wife and your son that our family will be thinking about you and we'll be praying for you and we will be open to anytime you want to come back on and and talk about this there's just nothing that we can say other than we are so sorry and we're with you we're with you so thank you for being here thank you that gottenberg thank thank you be right back thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and
