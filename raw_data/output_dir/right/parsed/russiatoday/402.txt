environmental activists fighting to
protect an ancient woodland in Germany
have clashed with police
that's after authorities attempted to
clear their treehouse camp they've
occupied the site for years as part of a
bid to block the building of a coal mine
there
this is one of the oldest and richest
mixed forests in Central Europe and is
being defer stood because our w/e run
some line here
so in this first we see many of the
contemporary struggles intersecting way
that RWE call its extraction causes
climate change primarily effects on
people of the global south
before there were some lawn structures
here campaign tans covered fireplaces
and a storage platform they had
permission to clear the barricades and
garbage only but they went way beyond
that they completely steward shelters
and took everything they could find like
40 containers bicycles tools and food
we cleared the barricades in vacated the
treehouses we've got people down from
the trees all in all we're pleased
up until now with how the operation has
gone because it's been practically free
of violence
I think that the police is criminalizing
our resistance acting against us with
violence and repression
