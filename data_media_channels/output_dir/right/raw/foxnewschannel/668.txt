1
00:00:03,176 --> 00:00:04,376
EVEN THOUGH LIBERAL AUGUST

2
00:00:04,377 --> 00:00:04,877
OF 2010.

3
00:00:04,878 --> 00:00:06,212
REMEMBER THAT AUGUST OF 2010

4
00:00:06,213 --> 00:00:07,613
SHE WAS CONFIRMED.

5
00:00:07,614 --> 00:00:08,714
MEANWHILE, WE TALKED WEEK

6
00:00:08,715 --> 00:00:10,316
AFTER WEEK ABOUT CIVILITY

7
00:00:10,317 --> 00:00:13,385
AND INCIVILITY AND NOW WE

8
00:00:13,386 --> 00:00:14,486
SEE MORE AND MORE CASES OF

9
00:00:14,487 --> 00:00:16,121
PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT BEING

10
00:00:16,122 --> 00:00:16,488
ASSAULTED.

11
00:00:16,489 --> 00:00:17,990
A MAN NOW CLAIMING HE WAS

12
00:00:17,991 --> 00:00:18,824
ASSAULTED BECAUSE HE HAD A

13
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:20,326
TRUMP FLAG OUT IN HIS YARD

14
00:00:20,327 --> 00:00:20,826
IN FLORIDA.

15
00:00:20,827 --> 00:00:22,828
A LONG ISLAND MAN NOW WAS

16
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:24,163
ARRESTED IN THE LAST DAY OR

17
00:00:24,164 --> 00:00:25,831
SO FOR MAKING THREATS TO

18
00:00:25,832 --> 00:00:27,766
KILL A CAMPAIGN WORKER, A

19
00:00:27,767 --> 00:00:29,702
VOLUNTEER, I BELIEVE, FOR

20
00:00:29,703 --> 00:00:31,103
CONGRESSMAN LEE ZELDIN WHO

21
00:00:31,104 --> 00:00:31,937
TWEETED THIS.

22
00:00:31,938 --> 00:00:33,806
IN THE U.S. POLITICAL SCORES

23
00:00:33,807 --> 00:00:35,774
ARE SETTLED AT THE BALLOT

24
00:00:35,775 --> 00:00:38,277
BOX, THE CONGRESSMAN SAYS.

25
00:00:38,278 --> 00:00:40,145
NOT BY TRYING TO KILL YOUR

26
00:00:40,146 --> 00:00:47,620
POLITICAL OPPONENTS.

27
00:00:47,621 --> 00:00:50,189
DONATO PANICO IS A GREAT

28
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,425
AMERICAN AND SUPPORTER OF @

29
00:00:53,426 --> 00:00:54,593
REAL DONALD TRUMP.

30
00:00:54,594 --> 00:00:56,996
AND ONE OF MY VOLUNTEERS.

31
00:00:56,997 --> 00:00:58,230
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN

32
00:00:58,231 --> 00:00:59,198
TARGETED LIKE THIS TODAY FOR

33
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,933
HIS PASSION AND INVOLVEMENT.

34
00:01:00,934 --> 00:01:01,767
PETE: SOMEONE DRIVES UP,

35
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,638
THEN HE GETS DRAGGED FOR

36
00:01:05,639 --> 00:01:07,506
30 FEET AS THE GUY DRIVES

37
00:01:07,507 --> 00:01:07,806
AWAY.

38
00:01:07,807 --> 00:01:09,708
AND THEN OUTSIDE OF A

39
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:10,776
CAMPAIGN OFFICE, WE'RE NOT

40
00:01:10,777 --> 00:01:12,411
JUST SCREAMING OR

41
00:01:12,412 --> 00:01:13,746
PROTESTING, WE'RE LITERALLY

42
00:01:13,747 --> 00:01:14,647
ASSAULTING AND THREATENING

43
00:01:14,648 --> 00:01:15,914
THE LIVES OF PEOPLE WHO WORK

44
00:01:15,915 --> 00:01:17,650
ON CAMPAIGNS.

45
00:01:17,651 --> 00:01:18,484
ABBY: HERE IS THE PROBLEM I

46
00:01:18,485 --> 00:01:19,918
SEE THIS IS BECOMING THE NEW

47
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:20,219
NORM.

48
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,520
WE ARE SEEING THIS EVERY

49
00:01:21,521 --> 00:01:22,921
SINGLE WEEK, MORE AND MORE

50
00:01:22,922 --> 00:01:23,822
OF THESE STORIES HAPPENING.

51
00:01:23,823 --> 00:01:25,624
WE ARE NOT EVEN NUT THICK OF

52
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:26,725
THE MID TERMS YET.

53
00:01:26,726 --> 00:01:27,393
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

54
00:01:27,394 --> 00:01:29,228
DURING THOSE DAYS AND THEN

55
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,201
PROUD OF THE PERSON YOU ARE

56
00:01:36,202 --> 00:01:36,602
SUPPORTING.

57
00:01:36,603 --> 00:01:37,336
I DO WORRY ABOUT WHERE WE

58
00:01:37,337 --> 00:01:38,237
ARE AS A COUNTRY AND MAKING

59
00:01:38,238 --> 00:01:39,672
THIS THE NORMAL AND THINKING

60
00:01:39,673 --> 00:01:40,105
THIS IS OKAY.

61
00:01:44,711 --> 00:01:45,811
THERE ASK THEM TO LEAVE A

62
00:01:45,812 --> 00:01:46,712
RESTAURANT BECAUSE YOU DON'T

63
00:01:46,713 --> 00:01:48,180
AGREE WITH WHO THEY WORK FOR

64
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:49,515
OR WHATEVER IT IS.

65
00:01:49,516 --> 00:01:50,883
WHAT IS IT GOING TO TAKE A

66
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,987
WHAT MAXINE WATERS IS

67
00:01:54,988 --> 00:01:55,321
SAYING.

68
00:01:55,322 --> 00:01:57,189
WHAT SHE SAYS NOW IS

69
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,926
TRICKLING INTO THE POPULACE

70
00:02:00,927 --> 00:02:03,195
OF THAT SIDE.

71
00:02:03,196 --> 00:02:03,929
GOT TO BE CHUCK SCHUMER AND

72
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:04,563
NANCY PELOSI.

73
00:02:04,564 --> 00:02:05,731
WE DID IT LAST HOUR.

74
00:02:05,732 --> 00:02:06,899
THE JOB NUMBERS, EVEN NANCY

75
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,267
PELOSI SAYS WE HAVE GREAT

76
00:02:11,304 --> 00:02:13,138
WHEN YOUR LEADER WON'T EACH

77
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:13,939
ACKNOWLEDGE GOOD ECONOMIC

78
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,174
DATA AND EVERYTHING IS EVIL

79
00:02:15,175 --> 00:02:16,241
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT, NO

80
00:02:16,242 --> 00:02:18,110
SURPRISE THAT THE RANK AND

81
00:02:18,111 --> 00:02:18,477
FILE.

82
00:02:18,478 --> 00:02:20,379
ABBY: WHY DOES SHE DO THAT?

83
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,947
THAT DOESN'T BENEFIT THE

84
00:02:21,948 --> 00:02:22,247
PARTY.

85
00:02:22,248 --> 00:02:22,848
THEY DON'T WANT TO

86
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:23,482
ACKNOWLEDGE THE PARTY IS

87
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,923
ED: BILL MAHER WANTS

88
00:02:30,924 --> 00:02:31,623
RECESSION BECAUSE HE THINKS

89
00:02:31,624 --> 00:02:32,758
IT WILL GET DONALD TRUMP OUT

90
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:33,192
OF OFFICE.

91
00:02:33,193 --> 00:02:34,159
HE DOESN'T CARE IF THE

92
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,728
ECONOMY IS BAD FOR YOU.

93
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:36,395
ABBY: I WAS THINKING ABOUT

94
00:02:36,396 --> 00:02:39,398
THAT THE OTHER DAY IF THERE

95
00:02:41,768 --> 00:02:43,369
EATING HIS STEAK TARTAR, HIS

96
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,171
LIFE WOULDN'T CHANGE.

97
00:02:46,172 --> 00:00:00,000
SO FOR HIM IT DOESN'T
