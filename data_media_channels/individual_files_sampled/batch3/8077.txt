THIS REPORT DID NOT FIND ANY EVIDENCE OF POLITICAL BIAS OR IMPROPER CONSIDERATIONS ACTUALLY IMPACTING THE INVESTIGATION UNDER REVIEW. THE REPORT DOES IDENTIFY ERRORS OF JUDGMENT VIOLATIONS OF OR EVEN DISREGARD FOR POLICY AND IT DECISIONS THAT THE VERY LEAST, WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT, WERE NOT THE BEST CHOICES. WE WILL ADHERE TO THE APPROPRIATE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS, AND ONCE THAT PROCESS IS COMPLETE WE WON'T HESITATE TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS. Bret: AT THE FBI DIRECTOR CHRIS WRAY REACTING TO THE REPORT FROM THE DOJ. 568 PAGES, AND IN IT, JIM COMEY TAKES IT ON THE CHIN. ALONG WITH SOME OTHERS IN THERE. LET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL, CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR FOR "THE WASHINGTON TIMES," CHARLES LANE, OPENING WRITER FOR "THE WASHINGTON POST," AND MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR AND CHIEF OF "THE WASHINGTON FREE BEACON." CHARLIE, WHAT DO YOU TAKE FROM THIS REPORT, YOUR REACTION TO IT AND WHERE WE ARE GOING? Charles: I THINK THE MOST INTERESTING THING IS, TOP LINE, YOU HAVE PEOPLE SAYING THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF POLITICAL BIAS IN THE WHOLE PROCESS, WHICH IS STRANGE CREDULITY TO THINK ABOUT THAT. AB THERE IS NO SMOKING GUN WHERE JAMES COMEY SAID BLATANTLY, I WANT TO RAKE THIS THING SO THAT HILLARY CLINTON WINS AND DONALD TRUMP LOSES. BUT ALL THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE REPORT SHOWS AT RAMPANT POLITICAL BIAS, ALL UP AND DOWN THE SYSTEM. WHETHER IT'S PETER STRZOK AND HIS STAR-CROSSED LEVER, OR LORETTA LYNCH AND HER DECISION TO PUNT ON THE ENTIRE THING AFTER THE MEETING ON THE TARMAC WITH BILL CLINTON, AND THE WHOLE THING TO JAMES COMEY, OR ALL THE OTHER CHARACTERS THAT CLEARLY HAD AN UNMISTAKABLE BIAS HERE. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU STOP AND CONSIDER THE FINAL DECISION THAT THEY MADE WHEN JAMES COMEY COMES OUT AND GIVES THIS WITHERING INDICTMENT, AND SAYS, BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO INDICT HER. Bret: SPEAKING OF LORENZO LYNCH, I TALKED TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER ABOUT THE EMAIL CASE. WHO IS THE ULTIMATE DECIDER AT THE DOJ? IT DEPENDS ON HOW THE MATTER COMES TOGETHER. ESSENTIALLY IT WILL BE REVIEWED BY THOSE CAREER INDEPENDENT AGENCY LAWYERS THAT I MENTIONED AND THEY WILL MAKE A COMMENDATION AS TO WHAT THEY HAVE DISCOVERED AND WHAT THEY RECOMMENDED. Bret: BUT THE UP OR DOWN, YES OR NO, GOING FORWARD OR NOT, IS THAT YOU? IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THEY FIND. IT WASN'T HER. I THINK SHE COMES OFF NOT TOO HOT IN THIS REPORT BECAUSE HER INABILITY TO SORT OF RESOLVE ONE OR THE OTHER, AND I EITHER GOING TO RECUSE BECAUSE I MET WITH BILL CLINTON ON THE TARMAC, OR AM I GOING TO STAY IN AND TAKE THE HEAT? SHE NEVER CAME TO REST ON THAT POINT WHICH CREATED THE OPENING FOR JANE CALL JIM COMY FOR JANE CALL JIM COMT FOR JANE CALL JIM COMO FOR JANE CALL JIM COMC FOR JANE CALL JIM COMM FOR JANE CALL JIM COME FOR JANE CALL JIM COMA FOR JANE CALL JIM COMO FOR JANE CALL JIM COMG FOR JANE CALL JIM COM, WHICH OF COURSE THE AJI CLAIMS IS TOTAL VIOLATION OF PROCEDURE. MY TAKE ON THIS REPORT IS, IT SHOWS THAT THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF THIS IN IT FOR EVERYONE. I KNOW HILLARY AND TRUMP ARE LOOKING AT THIS VINDICATION, CLAIMING THAT IT SHOWS CLEARLY THAT JIM COMEY INTERVENED IN THIS THING IMPROPERLY AND THAT HURT HILLARY'S CHANCES FOR THE ELECTION. I THINK IT IS JUST STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE, YOU DON'T COMMENT ON AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION IF YOU ARE THE FLATFOOT DOING THE INVESTIGATION FLATFOOT DOING THE INVESTIGATIO INVESTIGATION. COMEY THOUGHT IT WAS HIS RESPONSIBILITY IS TO SOMEHOW USURP THOUGHT, AND THAT'S NOT MY WORD BUT THIS IG'S WORD, USE HER. HE DID IT WITHOUT DISCUSSING WITH HIS SUPERIORS AND THAT'S PRETTY HEAVY STUFF. Bret: THE REVELATION OF THIS OTHER TEXT BETWEEN LISA PAGE AND PETER STRZOK, THE SECOND PART OF IT THAT COMES OUT JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, NO, NO HE WON'T. REFERRING TO TRUMP BEING PRESIDENT. WE WILL STOP IT, STRZOK RESPONSE TO PAIGE. THAT IS DONE BEFORE THE DECISION TO A SLOW WALK THE INVESTIGATION INTO ANTHONY WEINER'S OF THE EMAILS ON HIS COMPUTER. AND THE IG SAYS, THAT'S A PLACE WHERE THE POLITICAL VIRUS COULD HAVE INFECTED THIS ENTIRE THING. AND IT WAS ALSO DONE RIGHT AROUND THE TIME THAT WE KNOW THAT THE OTHER INVESTIGATION, CROSS FIRE HURRICANE, WAS BEING OPENED INTO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. AND STRZOK WAS INVOLVED IN BOTH OF THEM. AT 558 PAGES, IT'S LIKE THE WAR AND PEACE OF JUDGMENT. EVERYONE, FROM HILLARY CLINTON WHO STARTED THIS WITH THE EMAILS ON A CLASSIFIED SERVER TO EMAILS BETWEEN STRZOK AND PAGE, INCLUDING JAMES COMEY, INCLUDING ANDREW McCABE, INCLUDING SOME HALF-DOZEN OFFICIALS THAT HAVE BEEN REASSIGNED OR RETIRED SENSE OF SCANDAL HAS DEVELOPED, THEY ALL EXERCISED GREAT MISJUDGMENT.
