SEN.
DIANNE FEINSTEIN HAS BEEN
UP UNTIL WHITE NOW SHOCKINGLY
OUT OF STEP WITH HER
CONSTITUENTS ON THE ISSUE
OF MARIJUANA.
TODAY SHE TAKES ANOTHER STEP TO
BE LESS OUT OF STEP BECAUSE
SHE SAID THIS.
AND TO THAT I SAY IS SHE NOT
MERCIFUL?
BUT THAT IS HER MOVING
TOWARDS THE POSITION OF HER
STATE.
SHE WENT ON 
TO SAY THIS.
SO SHE SEEMS TO HAVE TO SOME
EXTENT SURRENDERED ON TRYING TO
GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO
COME IN AGAINST CALIFORNIA LAW
TO SHUT DOWN THE PLACES SELLING
MARIJUANA AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
SHE IS STILL PUSHING BASICALLY
THE PLOT LINE OF REEFER MADNESS.
IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME COMING
THAT SHE HAS STARTED TO MOVE IN
OUR DIRECTION, BUT WE ARE STILL
QUITE FAR OFF.
THE FEDS BEING AT ODDS WITH
THE STATE CREATES ALL TYPES OF
OTHER ISSUES BECAUSE AS WE KNOW
THAT THE BANKING REGULATIONS IS
SUCH THAT THEY WON'T TAKE CREDIT
CARDS AT THESE OUTLETS BECAUSE
THEY'RE AFRAID OF THE FEDS
CRACKING DOWN.
THERE IS A WHOLE ECONOMIC
IMPACT ON THIS INDUSTRY THAT
AFFECTS TAXES AND THE HEALTH OF
THE STATE.
IS A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM THAN
JUST THE APPROVAL OF THE DRUG
ITSELF, OF MARIJUANA BEING
EQUAL TO ALCOHOL OR A GATEWAY
DRUG OR WHATEVER.
THAT IS ALMOST LIVING IS A
SEPARATE ISSUE GIVEN ALL
THE PROBLEMS WITH THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT BEING OUT OF
STEP WITH THE STATES.
WELCOME TO 2018.
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS YOU
CAN'T EVEN TALK TO SOMEONE
WHO WAS STILL STUCK ON THIS.
SHE IS MAKING LIKE YOU SAID THE
OLD REEFER MADNESS FROM THE 40S
OR 50S AND YOU ARE JUST NOT
GOING TO GET HER TO GO
ALONG WITH HER CURRENT THINKING.
THE MONEY IS THE BIG DEAL
BECAUSE THEY HAVE ALL THIS MONEY
LIKE COLORADO 
AND WASHINGTON.
I'M NOT A YOUNG MAN BUT IT IS
LIKE TRYING TO TELL MY
GRANDMOTHER THAT WEED IS OKAY.
HE WOULD BE LIKE TRYING TO TELL
YOUR GRANDMOTHER ñ SHE IS FROM A
GENERATION WHERE IT WAS THIS
HORRIBLE THING AND SHE IS NOT
CHANGING HER MIND.
LET'S ACKNOWLEDGE EVERY
SINGLE PERSON UNDERSTANDS
WHAT IS UNDERLYING THE STORY.
THE REASON SHE IS MOVING IS NOT
THAT SHE WAS THINKING ABOUT IT.
IT WAS A REFLECTIVE MOMENT.
SHE IS IN A PRIMARY AND THIS
IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU
HAVE PROGRESSIVE CHALLENGERS IN
A PRIMARY.
THAT'S WHY WHEN PEOPLE SAY THE
PRIMARIES ARE THE WORST THING IN
THE WORLD, ALL THAT IS BS.
THE PRIMARY CHALLENGE IS
SUCCESSFUL IT CAN RESULT IN A
BETTER MORE REPRESENTATIVE
CANDIDATE REPRESENTING A
DISTRICT OR STATE.
EVEN IF IT ISN'T BEFORE YOU HAVE
THE PRIMARY IT CAN LEAD TO THE
CANDIDATE FINALLY ADAPTING ON
SOME ISSUES AND MOVING ON
THE DIRECTION 
YOU 
NEED TO MOVE
IT.
YOU STILL HAVE PEOPLE SPENDING
TIME IN JAIL FOR SIMPLE
POSSESSION OF THINGS THAT NOW I
CAN GO AND BUY RIGHT NOW.
I TALKED TO A CANDIDATE ON
REBEL HEADQUARTERS ABOUT
INSTITUTING REPARATIONS FOR
THOSE WHO HAD SPENT TIME IN
JAIL FOR POSSESSION OF WEED.
THERE WAS SO MUCH FARTHER WE CAN
GO ON THIS ISSUE AND YOU HAVE TO
ASK YOURSELF WHO I WANT
AS MY CHAMPION?
SOMEONE WHO WAS RELUCTANTLY
APPROACHING MY CURRENT POSITION
OR SOMEONE WHO WAS LOOKING TO
THE FUTURE AND THE NEXT STEPS
WHEN IT COMES TO LEGISLATION
HAVING TO DO WITH MARIJUANA.
THANKFULLY WE GOT A PRIMARY
COMING UP SO WE GET TO MAKE
THAT DETERMINATION.
I HATE TO SAY OLD BECAUSE
THERE ARE ALSO SOME FORWARD
THINKING OLDER PEOPLE.
I THINK MOST OF THE POINT OF
PROGRESSIVE POLITICS DOES
NOT REPRESENT OUR VIEW TO THE
FUTURE.
I REALLY THOUGHT WE WOULD'VE
OUTGROWN THIS.
HE'S RIGHT ABOUT THE GRANDMOTHER
THING, I REMEMBER BEING A KID
AND THINKING IT IS GOING TO BE
SO COOL THAT ALL THESE PEOPLE
TO THINK- WE ALL VOTE IN COOL
NEW PEOPLE WHO GET THIS
MARIJUANA
THING.
AND YET WE HAVEN'T, IT IS
INSANE.
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WON'T
COME AROUND ON THIS AND NOW EVEN
THE SENATOR OF ONE OF THE MOST
PROGRESSIVE FORWARD THINKING
STATES HAS JUST NOW COME AROUND
INCREMENTALLY ON IT.
WHEN I SAY OLD I DON'T MEAN ñ
BUT IT'S ALSO THE THING OF HOW
LONG HAS SHE BEEN IN THE SENATE?
30 SOMETHING YEARS?
COMPLETELY OUT OF TOUCH WITH
PEOPLE.
YOU LITERALLY HAVE TO TALK HER
INTO AGREEING TO A LAW THAT
THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA VOTED
FOR.
THAT IS RIDICULOUS THAT YOU HAVE
TO TALK TO A SENATOR LIKE ñ THIS
ISN'T LIKE PEOPLE TALKING ARE
PEOPLE GETTING HIGH AND JOKING.
THERE WAS AN ELECTION IN
CALIFORNIA VOTED IN CALIFORNIA
SAID MARIJUANA SHOULD BE LEGAL
FOR RECREATIONAL USE FOR ADULTS
TO USE.
AND SHE IS LIKE MAYBE IT IS
OKAY.
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR
PERSONAL OPINION.
YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT
THE PEOPLE AND THE PEOPLE
HAVE SPOKEN.
IF YOUR PERSONAL OPINION DOES
NOT AGREE WITH THE PEOPLE EITHER
LEAVE THE JOB OR SUCK IT UP AND
REPRESENT THE PEOPLE.
WHEN YOU'VE BEEN IN THE SENATE
FOR SOME 30 ODD YEARS YOU ARE
COMPLETELY OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE
PERSON YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT
THAT THIS IS WHY YOUNG
PROGRESSIVE PEOPLE FEEL
THAT NO ONE REPRESENTS US.
BECAUSE SHE WAS A SENATOR FOR 10
YEARS BEFORE I WAS BORN.
WE HAVE A MODEL FOR THIS.
THEY VOTE PRO-CHOICE BECAUSE
THEY KNOW THAT IS WHAT THEIR
STATE WANTS.
YOU CAN DO THAT FOR OTHER ISSUES
TOO.
