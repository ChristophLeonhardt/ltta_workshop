our cities like New York stuck with radical far-left mayor's like Bill DeBlasio for the foreseeable future well if things don't change dramatically I fear they are we first have to look at who bill de blasio is or actually is it bill de blasio isn't even his real name I mean it's his legal name but it's not his given name the guy was born in 1961 as Warren Wilhelm jr. in 1983 he legally changed his name to Warren de blasio Wilhelm he hyphenated his mom's maiden name in between his first and last and in 2002 as recently as 2002 he finally became the guy we all know and love Bill DeBlasio and what about its past well he's been a communist sympathizer that we may even be a communist it comes from communist roots in the 1940s his mother worked for a US government agency called the office of War Information and their mission makes me very uncomfortable he they were tasked with painting Stalin in a positive light to sell our alliance with him against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan and Bill de Blasio's mother was one of the Communist propagandists they hired to do just that look a guy comes from a long line of communist sympathizers communists radicals and far lefties in 1983 he himself went on a propaganda indoctrination trip to Russia in 1988 he went down into karaage WA to hang out with Daniel Ortega and the violent communist Sandinistas they despised America the Blasio ran right to them the height of the Cold War this guy was going to Russia going to Nicaragua to hang out with our enemies and today he's mayor of the financial capital of the world America's largest city New York City it is absolutely mind-blowing how does a guy who supported people like Joanne Chesimard aka Assata Shakur a cop-killer on the FBI's most-wanted terrorist list one of the reasons that police officers turn their backs on him at police funerals how does a guy who supports terrorist Oscar Lopez Rivera the Puerto Rican separate his bomber when the political heat became too much to Blasio backed away from but only about 200 feet because they both marched in the Puerto Rican Day Parade only de Blasio marched about half a block behind Rivera so in addition to me in a communist the Blasio is also a coward how does a guy like this get elected in mayor of New York City but we've got to go back to the 2013 Democratic primary see there was only 7 percent voter turnout it was tiny and those people were among the city's most radical the most far left they made the Blasio their nominee because they loved him he sounds like them he empathizes with them he's one of them they knew him they trusted him to further their far-left agenda and the general election was no better there was only 24 percent voter turnout seventy-three point three percent of the city's most well I should say of that twenty four percent most radical far-left voters made Bill DeBlasio their mayor his challenger Joe Lhota only received twenty four point three percent of the vote you're probably saying who in the world is Joe Lhota and that's an unfortunate question because Joe Lhota was Rudy Giuliani's deputy mayor he was the guy who implemented many of Giuliani's nuts-and-bolts solutions solutions I experienced when I was a cop under Giuliani they worked they were outstanding but Giuliani was larger than life and when he came into a room he sucked the air out of it the media attention was only on him but people like Joe Lhota that were doing outstanding work often went unnoticed in 2013 when the election rolled around Joe Lhota got no support no fundraising no endorsements de Blasio on the other hand had Alec Baldwin at every of any of the Hollywood crowd backing him George store owes pumping money into his campaign Soros was one of his main backers and he had Hillary Clinton's infrastructure because the Blasio was the campaign manager for Hillary Clinton's 2000 Senate race in New York State and I fear history is repeating itself I fear it repeating itself because in this 2017 mayoral election coming up next month the Blasio's GOP challenger seems like a sacrificial lamb her name is Nicole malliotakis and de Blasio was 35 points ahead of her now Fox News guy former NYPD detective and private eye Bo Dietl is in the race as well but it seems like all he's doing is screaming at people and cheering on the new year at Yankees bow is amusing but I don't see him as a formidable challenger for mayor of New York City I wish he was it'd be refreshing but what do we do how do we change this tide how do we reverse it how do we get these radicals to give up their grasp on our cities well it's gonna take two things the first one would be a tougher Republican Party and I have no faith in this Republican establishment they are weak they are gutless they sicken me for the second hour Donald Trump like candidates well-known wealthy high name recognition but that's a really big ask because we saw with the press Ted to the Trump family during the presidential race we saw what they did to Donald Trump himself and his reputation a lot to ask somebody to do to themselves their families but unless they do it we're gonna be doomed these cities will be under far-left radical communist sympathetic Democrat control for generations it's terrible for those cities and it's terrible when you look at issues like sanctuary cities an illegal immigration for the United States of America if you like this content if you find it as important as I do please subscribe to our premium service at www.mediaed.org thanks for watching you
