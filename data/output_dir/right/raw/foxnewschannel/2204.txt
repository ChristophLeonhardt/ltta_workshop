1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,684
MEADOWS FIRED BACK THAT

2
00:00:01,684 --> 00:00:03,586
ROSENSTEIN SHOULD STICK TO FACTS

3
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:05,855
AND NOT RHETORIC.

4
00:00:05,855 --> 00:00:07,690
>>  ALL RIGHT.

5
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,959
WE ARE JOINED NOW BY A MEMBER OF

6
00:00:09,959 --> 00:00:14,998
THE HOUSE, FREEDOM CAUCUS.

7
00:00:14,998 --> 00:00:17,834
THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN FROM

8
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:18,468
FLORIDA.

9
00:00:18,468 --> 00:00:19,435
GOOD EVENING.

10
00:00:19,435 --> 00:00:19,736
OKAY.

11
00:00:19,736 --> 00:00:21,838
SO YOU PROBABLY HEARD A LITTLE

12
00:00:21,838 --> 00:00:23,673
BIT FROM THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY

13
00:00:23,673 --> 00:00:24,641
GENERAL RESPONDING TO THIS.

14
00:00:24,641 --> 00:00:26,876
I WANT TO PLAY MORE OF WHAT HE

15
00:00:26,876 --> 00:00:29,779
HAD TO SAY TODAY WHEN THIS TOPIC

16
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:30,813
CAME UP.

17
00:00:30,813 --> 00:00:33,016
>>  DIFFERENT PEOPLE WHO HAVE

18
00:00:33,016 --> 00:00:34,651
BEEN MAKING THREATS PRIVATELY

19
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:36,419
AND PUBLICLY AGAINST ME FOR

20
00:00:36,419 --> 00:00:37,854
QUITE SOME TIME.

21
00:00:37,854 --> 00:00:38,921
AND I THINK THEY SHOULD

22
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:40,456
UNDERSTAND BY NOW, THE

23
00:00:40,456 --> 00:00:41,491
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS NOT

24
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:46,062
GOING TO BE EXTORTED.

25
00:00:46,062 --> 00:00:46,796
WE'RE GOING TO DO WHAT'S

26
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:48,898
REQUIRED BY THE RULE OF LAW.

27
00:00:48,898 --> 00:00:52,101
>>  WHAT YOU MAKE OF THAT?

28
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:54,537
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE EXTORTED

29
00:00:54,537 --> 00:00:55,138
THE DOJ.

30
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:58,074
>>  WELL, EARLIER YOU PLAYED A

31
00:00:58,074 --> 00:01:00,009
CLIP WHERE ROSENSTEIN SAID NO

32
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:01,978
HOUSE REPUBLICANS WOULD PUT

33
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:09,952
NARROW -- THEIR NAMES OF THESE

34
00:01:09,952 --> 00:01:13,456
ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT.

35
00:01:13,456 --> 00:01:15,458
ROSENSTEIN HIMSELF SIGNED THE

36
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:17,560
DOCUMENT TO SPY ON AN AMERICAN

37
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,761
CITIZEN WITH NO JUSTIFICATION.

38
00:01:18,761 --> 00:01:21,531
HE ALSO PUT HIS NAME ON THE

39
00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:24,067
PLEADING TO SILENCE THE

40
00:01:24,067 --> 00:01:29,739
WHISTLEBLOWER IN THE URANIUM ONE

41
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:30,039
CASE.

42
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:31,974
THE DEFINITION OF EXTORTION IS

43
00:01:31,974 --> 00:01:33,209
FORCING SOMEONE TO DO SOMETHING

44
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:34,444
THAT THEY HAVE NO LEGAL

45
00:01:34,444 --> 00:01:36,346
OBLIGATION TO DO UNDER SOME

46
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:36,679
THREAT.

47
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:37,547
ROD ROSENSTEIN HAS AN OBLIGATION

48
00:01:37,547 --> 00:01:38,715
TO FOLLOW THE LAW.

49
00:01:38,715 --> 00:01:40,416
THAT'S ALL WE WANT HIM TO DO.

50
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:43,119
AND WHAT'S MOST TELLING ABOUT

51
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,488
HIS VIEWPOINT OR HIS MOST RECENT

52
00:01:45,488 --> 00:01:46,856
COMMENTS TO THE NEW YORK TIMES

53
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,792
WHERE HE SAID HE DOESN'T BELIEVE

54
00:01:49,792 --> 00:01:51,494
THAT THE CONGRESS HAS A

55
00:01:51,494 --> 00:01:53,596
CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO

56
00:01:53,596 --> 00:01:56,666
CONDUCT OVERSIGHT.

57
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:59,035
AND THEN OF COURSE ENSURE THAT

58
00:01:59,035 --> 00:01:59,936
THOSE FUNDS ARE USED IN

59
00:01:59,936 --> 00:02:02,872
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW.

60
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,274
HERE THE FBI AND DEPARTMENT OF

61
00:02:05,274 --> 00:02:07,577
JUSTICE DEPARTEDED FROM THE LAW.

62
00:02:07,577 --> 00:02:09,044
THEY DID SO BECAUSE THEY WERE

63
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:10,513
OUT TO GET DONALD TRUMP.

64
00:02:10,513 --> 00:02:17,520
>>  LET'S TALK ABOUT CHAIRMAN

65
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,020
GOODLATTE.

66
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,357
IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S PROGRESS

67
00:02:21,357 --> 00:02:24,427
ON SOME OF THESE FRONTS AS FAR

68
00:02:24,427 --> 00:02:25,995
AS COOPERATION WITH THE DOJ.

69
00:02:25,995 --> 00:02:27,563
WHY IS THAT NOT ENOUGH?

70
00:02:27,563 --> 00:02:28,998
>>  WE'RE NOT GETTING THE

71
00:02:28,998 --> 00:02:30,533
DOCUMENTS FAST ENOUGH.

72
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:33,069
WE'VE REQUESTED 1.3 DOCUMENTS

73
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,337
AND WE'VE RECEIVED ONLY A FEW

74
00:02:34,337 --> 00:02:36,539
THOUSAND AT A TIME.

75
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:38,441
THAT'S ENTIRELY INAPPROPRIATE.

76
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:41,544
NOW ROSENSTEIN HAS SHOWN HIS

77
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:42,078
CARDS.

78
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,213
HE DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE

79
00:02:44,213 --> 00:02:45,181
A CONSTITUTIONAL ABILITY TO

80
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:46,382
CONDUCT OVERSIGHT.

81
00:02:46,382 --> 00:02:47,517
I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF

82
00:02:47,517 --> 00:02:51,053
JUSTICE AND THE FBI KNOW THEY

83
00:02:51,053 --> 00:02:52,722
DID WRONG IN THESE FISA WARRANTS

84
00:02:52,722 --> 00:02:54,957
THAT WERE BASED ON FALSE

85
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:56,559
INFORMATION WHERE THEY WERE NOT

86
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:58,394
DISCLOSING THE FACTS TO THE

87
00:02:58,394 --> 00:02:58,694
COURT.

88
00:02:58,694 --> 00:03:00,196
THEY'RE HOPING IF THIS TAKES

89
00:03:00,196 --> 00:03:02,598
LONG ENOUGH AND THIS SURVIVES TO

90
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:05,835
THE NOVEMBER ELECTIONS, THERE'S

91
00:03:05,835 --> 00:03:07,737
A CHANCE DEMOCRATS WILL TAKE

92
00:03:07,737 --> 00:03:09,505
CONTROL AND THERE WILL JUST BE A

93
00:03:09,505 --> 00:03:11,441
WITCH HUNT OF THE PRESIDENT.

94
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,508
TIME IS NOT OUR FRIEND.

95
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:13,676
>>  QUICKLY ON THIS IDEA OF THE

96
00:03:13,676 --> 00:03:17,280
FALL ELECTIONS, WHICH YOU

97
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,382
MENTIONED JENNIFER RUBEN SAYS

98
00:03:19,382 --> 00:03:22,919
THIS, THESE PEOPLE, MEANING YOU

99
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,220
GUYS, TALKING ABOUT IMPEACHMENT

100
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,456
ARE NUTS AND UNFIT TO HOLD

101
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:26,956
OFFICE.

102
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:27,290
ENOUGH.

103
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:27,957
VOTE THEM OUT.

104
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,692
HOW DOES THIS FACTOR IN?

105
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:32,195
>>  WELL, SHE HAS ONE VOTE JUST

106
00:03:32,195 --> 00:03:33,095
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

107
00:03:33,095 --> 00:03:35,064
THE FOLKS IN MY DISTRICT AND

108
00:03:35,064 --> 00:03:36,732
ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE FED UP

109
00:03:36,732 --> 00:03:37,800
WITH THE MISTREATMENT OF OUR

110
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,201
PRESIDENT.

111
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:41,370
WE'VE GOT A PRESIDENT WHO'S OUT

112
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:48,811
THERE TRYING TO DENUCLEARIZE THE

113
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:49,812
KOREAN PENINSULA.

114
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,348
AND HE HAS TO DEAL WITH THIS.

115
00:03:52,348 --> 00:03:55,017
IF THERE EVEN WAS A PROSECUTION,

116
00:03:55,017 --> 00:03:55,918
ROSENSTEIN WOULD BE A WITNESS

117
00:03:55,918 --> 00:03:58,187
BASED ON THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE

118
00:03:58,187 --> 00:03:59,489
RELEASED ABOUT COMEY'S FIRING.

119
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,091
SO YOU CAN'T OVERSEE AN

120
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:03,259
INVESTIGATION WHEN YOU COULD

121
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:05,695
POTENTIALLY BE A WITNESS IN THAT

122
00:04:05,695 --> 00:04:06,128
INVESTIGATION.

123
00:04:06,128 --> 00:04:06,896
THESE AREN'T THINGS THAT ARE

124
00:04:06,896 --> 00:04:07,196
NUTS.

125
00:04:07,196 --> 00:04:09,665
WE JUST WANT THE LAW TO BE

126
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:10,032
FOLLOWED.

127
00:04:10,032 --> 00:04:11,200
>>  KEEP US UP TO DATE.

128
00:04:11,200 --> 00:00:00,000
WE KNOW THAT WE'LL BE WATCHING
