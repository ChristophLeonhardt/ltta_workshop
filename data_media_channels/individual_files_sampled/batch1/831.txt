electronic products they have the iPhone there is Samsung elsewhere in our own country we have vostell German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called on air to want to respect the central bank's independence Lamont Avila cycads austere the German perspective is that no one has an interest in Turkey's economic destabilization but everything must be done to ensure that there is an independent central bank that can work all right let's bring in our panel joining us in Ankara özgür unn Lucas articulate director of the Ankara office of the German Marshall Fund of the United States in Berlin Dietrich von cow former German ambassador and permanent representative to the EU and in London egg a set skin a senior political risk analyst at the firm IHS market welcome to you all Oscar I want to start with you today what can the government of Turkey do to stop this slide well I mean they should do first of all we should maybe look into why this crisis has occurred even before the fall out with the United States I could cite six reasons first the very high current account deficits second the private sector depth third political risk at home for geopolitical risks abroad five market unfriendly economic policies and a six fiscal normalization in the United States some of these that are there is nothing that turkey can do about such as the fiscal normalization in the United States but there's still a lot that turkey can do for market friendly economic policies decreasing political risk at home decreasing private sector depth and decreasing the current account deficit this would require political reforms as well as economic reforms deitrick have any of the efforts by turkey central bank thus far to try and reverse this decline been effective are there any signs that any of them are working I don't I think they might get though in the right direction but we'll probably in all likelihood not be enough because what we are facing is a lack of confidence by investors by international markets in Turkey and that has to do with the attitude of the president of Iran and there is a lack of confidence and therefore the central bank would have from my point of view have to increase interest rate take real firm measures which might not be very popular with the general public and therefore the president hesitates to accept this and the markets know this so there's a lack of confidence and as long as this will stay on it will be very difficult for Turkey to recuperate okay you heard Dietrich Lear talk about the fact that president air Dewan has resisted thus far raising interest rates why exactly is that well for a long time the general consensus in the markets was that when aired one insisted on his theory that high interest rates result in high inflation rather than the other way around that was largely for the purpose of playing to the crowds so to speak for for the domestic audience however we saw in a meeting recently when Ardoin came to London to talk to international investors the president repeated those claims and it was at that point that the markets started understanding that these were things which are genuinely believed and that was really a turning point in terms of perceptions of Turkey and expectations of policy on their Diwan the president appears to have a deep-seated fundamental opposition to interest and whether that's rooted in his religious beliefs or what it might be the result is the same Turkey has been avoiding levels of interest which would be dictated by rational economic policy and the result is a destabilized the Turkish lira and rampant inflation and to act now and to follow what the market is saying now means that they have to do even more than what they would have had to do before because it's it's at this point it's very late and and the results are as we can see all right let's take a step back for a moment turkey is one of the fastest-growing economies and the sixth largest in Europe but it's facing major challenges the inflation rate has reached 15% this year the highest in 14 years Turkey's budget deficit rose by more than half to 13 billion dollars in 2017 the value of turkeys imports is higher than exports leading to a negative trade balance of almost 77 billion dollars last year but on a positive note the economy grew by seven point four percent in the first three months of this year I was here let me ask you how much worse could this now get for Turkey I mean could you envision a total financial collapse or meltdown in Turkey that is very unlikely because despite all the negative factors Turkey's public sector it's still strong Turkey does have a high international debt but it's coming mainly from the private sector and the public finances are very sound and as a matter of fact there are more among the soundest in Europe so a total financial meltdown is very unlikely at this moment Deitrick why specifically is what's happening in Turkey affecting emerging markets the way that it is well because emerging markets in certain ways are in similar situations as turkey is it's a precarious situation you are trying to stimulate economies and there's always the risk that you go beyond rational limits but in Turkey this has taken place due to the attitude of the President and therefore there's the risk that others will also be affected by the way we are in Europe very much intertwined in particular Germany with Turkey also economy clearly and therefore there's also a risk that we might suffer to a certain extent by far not as much as Turkey to a certain extent we will we expect everyone to visit us in September and will have serious discussions we are partners in NATO we are partners we have a a customs union between the EU and Turkey we have we have three million Turks partly with Turkish nationality party with German nationality partly with both in living in Germany working here and we have a vital interest in stable in a stable turkey DJ indeed I'm relieved I'm sorry in early Dietrich's I'm sorry to interrupt it's just that since you're bringing up they ties between Turkey and Germany that leads me to a follow-up question for you because on Monday German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that they want to make sure that you know that the central bank in Turkey has its independence she also said nobody has an interest in an economic destabilization in Turkey and everything must be done to ensure an independent central bank so my question for you is would Germany be in a position to help now in some way well I don't know we will give him l1d advice that our stability our rising out of the ashes of world war ii was largely due also due to not only our efforts and support and free trade and so forth but also that we were run by an our monetary policy by an independent central bank and also the European Central Bank has we insisted on that is independent no central bank that cannot act independently can pursue rational and reasonable monetary policies and if everyone doesn't understand this it may be almost hopeless to head Turkey but if he understood decide to see the light we might be able of course to help them because we have a vital interest in a stable turkey for all kinds of strategic economic reasons but also because turkey due to the 3 million turks in germany is part of our domestic policy scene ok what our president really wants options right now well that there are several options I mean the first obvious right thing to do would be to do what our other guest was suggesting to provide the central bank with the independence that it needs to fulfill its mandate but if aired on continues with his insistence to not allow this then the other options are one one of them of course going to the IMF there are many observers who are betting that this will end up being the case however of course there's a big issue with that and that is the fact that the government's really invested a lot in its claim that it was under this government that Turkey finally came out of these IMF programs and and subjugation to policies imposed by international organizations for everyone to go back to the IMF would be a big embarrassment another option would be to seek support from alternative allies which Ardoin has already hinted he might do Russia China Qatar but again it's dubious the extent of the help which these governments may be willing to offer and obviously releasing the pastor would be yet another option a very obvious solution to defuse the economic strains and the problem there of course is the fact that with the sanctions having been imposed on Turkey by President Trump everyone no longer has a way to come to a solution with the US was also saving face and not appearing like turkey is capitulating to to the US as threats and certainly to release the pastor Andrew Bunsen right now without any major concessions from the US side would appear to be doing exactly that so hence the difficulty of the situation Oscar you heard a gator talk about the detained American pastor Andrew Brunson my question is how much of this confrontation now is basically a fight between US president donald trump and turkish President Recep Tayyip air dawuan I believe that it is the tip of the iceberg because particularly in the United States as a matter of fact sanctions towards Turkey are related to pastor Branson are already being cooked in the Congress so even if the President had not weighed in we would see sanctions coming from the US Congress at verse 30 so as a matter of fact it's the visible part of a much deeper and bigger problem between the two between Turkey and the United States it includes turkeys purchase of s400 missiles from Russia it includes well I mean it includes differences between the United States and Turkey when it comes to Syria and actually the whole of the Middle East it includes public opinion towards the United States in Turkey and public opinion towards Turkey in the United States so I would not call it a problem between the president's my deitrick is the US turkey crisis beyond repair at this point or do you think that it can be mended well two types special types if you want to put it to egomaniacs are getting at each other I am quite squarely saying what I think about the two and that's always difficult in particular because they are both determined by let's say domestic policy consideration in the United States for instance that they have in November elections and the Bible Belt the past or the Bible Belt is importantly in the United States as support for President Trump and his party so you have this aspect and I would say that too the pastor who is of the same Protestant connotation Christian connotation as the vice president of the United States it plays a big role and we need to find a face-saving mechanism to get this pastor out of the fire line I think that is important yes there are other considerations and also like the game turkey plays by being half in half out NATO's half with the west half with Putin but buying war material from the Russians etc etc I think he is over stretching his limits and where he is vulnerable he has now been taught that there is no free lunch Eve not for a Turkish president on the other hand the American president doesn't care too much about what's going on in Europe including Turkey he has his own domestic agenda so we are in a very precarious situation and I as a German European I therefore think that not only Germany but the European Union has to play a certain role in order to get things calm down and but for that we need also some flexibility from both sides including also the president of Turkey okay it looked as though you were reacting to what Dietrich was saying there did you want to add to what he had remarked upon well my reaction was one of agreements for the first time the Turkish government finds itself with US counterparts where which doesn't really care whether turkey remains in the NATO or not at least when we talk about Trump himself it's not really one of his primary considerations that go into his decision-making until now Turkey always used that card based on the assumption that the US side would not risk losing turkey to Russia and breaking the NATO ranks and I think that was the source of the Turkish government's miscalculation in what happened in the past couple of weeks and the question now is based on what they have experienced whether the president mr. Ardoin will go into a strategic reconsideration in how it deals with the u.s. based on his realization that the old tactics no longer work that's the optimistic scenario the pessimistic scenario is one in which we are seeing the beginnings of a permanent break between these decades or old allies özgür what do you think what are the strategic and geopolitical ramifications of all of this first of all I would like to express that although a diplomatic solution is possible it is also very difficult at this point because the president of the United States with his tweets and statement says not only dig the seals into its current position but has also denied president erred on an honorable way out of this crisis so at the moment a unilateral let's say decision by President aired want to release pastor Branson would make him appear weak domestically and also internationally and that is something that president Ardoin would hate so the solution should be something in which pastor Branson is released in return for something that president add-on can present to the Turkish society as a success and the ramifications are actually are very concerning I don't think that either president Trump or president erred one has any intention to see turkey outside of NATO though maybe neither would care deeply I believe that this crisis could trigger a dynamic at the end of which Turkey's NATO membership would be questionable in Turkey as well as outside and even if it's not the intention of the Turkish president actually events could drag Turkey towards such a situation I believe that a lot is stage and we should start acting today Detrick analysts have been saying that this financial crisis in Turkey has been a long time in coming has this been a long time coming of course it has but it has been now reinforced by American countermeasures because of this this clergyman issue which should not be underestimated I would like to repeat we Germans as well as we Europeans have no interest in letting Turkey go down the drains so to speak economically we want a stable Turkey in good relations and terms with the EU aid with NATO with all possibilities for Turkey also to play her role in the Middle East etc so we want to be partners and we will when everyone comes to visit us in Berlin in September we will do our best to be of help whether that will be enough depends on the attitudes yes of the American president also but also of mr. Edwin I would like to remind you we were recently under heavy threats from the American president on trade issues and the Commission took a strong stand but also a flexible one and we came to a standstill and we are not negotiating it is not impossible to bring a similar situation about with between Turkey and the United States but it will require the help of friends and partners of Turkey and we are still economically strongly linked with turkey and also domestically through the three million turks in germany we will try to do our best whether we will be enough to do so you'll have probably the help of the Commission the EU Commission and major partners like France in in the EU and we will do our best this all we can hope it really it depends also on the flexibility or mall parties control participants all right we are out of time so we're gonna have to be there because I don't I want to be optimistic I am co-op team is deitrick relationship metric I'm sorry to interrupt what we have run out of time thank you very much we're gonna have to leave it there so thanks very much to all our guests Oscar and Lucas are giclee dietrich von cow and egg a said chicken and thank you too for watching you can see the program again any time by visiting our website aljazeera.com and for further discussion go to our Facebook page that's facebook.com forward slash AJ inside story you can also join the conversation on twitter our handle is at aj inside story from Nima how much improve and the whole team here bye for now
