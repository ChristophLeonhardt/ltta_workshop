1
00:00:06,946 --> 00:00:07,646
>> Martha: HURRICANE MICHAEL

2
00:00:07,647 --> 00:00:09,047
STILL BLASTING FLORIDA WITH

3
00:00:09,048 --> 00:00:10,148
100-MILE-PER-HOUR WINDS NOW AND

4
00:00:10,149 --> 00:00:12,651
HEAVY RAINS THROUGHOUT THE AREA.

5
00:00:12,652 --> 00:00:13,752
THE STATE IS BRACING FOR THE

6
00:00:13,753 --> 00:00:15,487
WORSE BUT HOPING FOR THE BEST.

7
00:00:15,488 --> 00:00:16,855
TONIGHT, IT'S TOO SOON TO KNOW

8
00:00:16,856 --> 00:00:18,523
HOW BAD THE DAMAGES OR IF LIVES

9
00:00:18,524 --> 00:00:19,858
WERE LOST AT THIS POINT.

10
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,460
AS WE JUST HEARD FROM PAM BONDI,

11
00:00:22,461 --> 00:00:23,461
FOLKS WILL TRY TO GET IN

12
00:00:23,462 --> 00:00:25,297
TOMORROW MORNING AND WHATEVER

13
00:00:25,298 --> 00:00:27,465
RESCUES THEY CAN, BUT EARLY

14
00:00:27,466 --> 00:00:28,633
SUGGESTIONS, ALREADY SUGGESTING

15
00:00:28,634 --> 00:00:30,135
THAT PRIVATE PROPERTY DAMAGE

16
00:00:30,136 --> 00:00:32,537
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 13 AND

17
00:00:32,537 --> 00:00:34,773
$19 BILLION, THROUGHOUT THIS

18
00:00:34,774 --> 00:00:37,242
WHOLE AREA.

19
00:00:37,243 --> 00:00:38,677
FOR RIGHT NOW, RON DeSANTIS IS

20
00:00:38,678 --> 00:00:39,711
IN JACKSONVILLE ABOUT 200 MILES

21
00:00:39,712 --> 00:00:42,047
FROM THE HIGH OF THIS STORM WITH

22
00:00:42,048 --> 00:00:43,882
THE LATEST ON THE HURRICANE AND

23
00:00:43,883 --> 00:00:45,483
ALSO HIS BID TO TAKE THE

24
00:00:45,484 --> 00:00:46,284
GOVERNOR'S MANSION.

25
00:00:46,285 --> 00:00:47,752
GOOD TO SEE YOU, SIR.

26
00:00:47,753 --> 00:00:51,356
WELCOME AND THANK YOU FOR BEING

27
00:00:51,357 --> 00:00:51,856
HERE TONIGHT.

28
00:00:51,857 --> 00:00:53,291
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE

29
00:00:53,292 --> 00:00:55,026
HURRICANE'S RESPONSE AND HOW

30
00:00:55,027 --> 00:00:56,394
THIS IS ALL BEING HANDLED?

31
00:00:56,395 --> 00:00:58,897
>> I THINK IN FLORIDA WE HAVE A

32
00:00:58,898 --> 00:01:00,298
GREAT CADRE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

33
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:01,399
FIRST RESPONDERS AND A VARIETY

34
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,735
OF DIFFERENT WAYS, BUT THIS IS

35
00:01:03,736 --> 00:01:05,370
ONE WAY WHERE, IF YOU ARE GOING

36
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,372
TO DO IT IN FLORIDA, YOU HAVE TO

37
00:01:07,373 --> 00:01:09,007
BE PREPARED TO REACT TO THESE

38
00:01:09,008 --> 00:01:09,341
STORMS.

39
00:01:09,342 --> 00:01:10,976
I THINK THEY HAVE TYPICALLY DONE

40
00:01:10,977 --> 00:01:12,344
A GREAT JOB AND ALL HANDS ARE ON

41
00:01:12,345 --> 00:01:14,045
DECK RIGHT NOW.

42
00:01:14,046 --> 00:01:17,282
THIS IS    IT WAS NOT A STORM TA

43
00:01:17,283 --> 00:01:17,315
THIS IS    IT WAS NOT A STORM TT

44
00:01:17,316 --> 00:01:17,882
THIS IS    IT WAS NOT A STORM TA

45
00:01:17,883 --> 00:01:19,417
WEEK AGO PEOPLE WERE REALLY

46
00:01:19,418 --> 00:01:20,652
PAYING ATTENTION TO.

47
00:01:20,653 --> 00:01:22,454
EVEN THREE OR FOUR DAYS AGO, WE

48
00:01:22,455 --> 00:01:23,154
KNEW SOMETHING WAS HAPPEN BUT

49
00:01:23,155 --> 00:01:24,623
THE FACT THAT IT MATURED SO

50
00:01:24,624 --> 00:01:26,057
QUICKLY INTO A CATEGORY OF FOUR,

51
00:01:26,058 --> 00:01:27,459
I THINK OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS A

52
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,260
LOT OF DAMAGE THAT IS BEING DONE

53
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:30,462
IN TERMS OF THE LOSS OF LIFE.

54
00:01:30,463 --> 00:01:32,130
I THINK THE QUESTION WILL BE,

55
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:34,299
HOW MANY PEOPLE DIDN'T HEED THE

56
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,901
CALL TO EVACUATE, AND ARE THEY

57
00:01:36,902 --> 00:01:38,870
ABLE TO HUNKER DOWN SAFELY OR

58
00:01:38,871 --> 00:01:39,137
NOT?

59
00:01:39,138 --> 00:01:40,438
I KNOW THOSE FIRST RESPONDERS

60
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,873
WILL BE ON THE SCENE IN

61
00:01:41,874 --> 00:01:45,010
PANAMA CITY BEACH AND ELSEWHERE,

62
00:01:45,011 --> 00:01:45,977
TRYING TO SAVE LIVES.

63
00:01:45,978 --> 00:01:47,679
>> Martha: AND HOW WILL YOU

64
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:47,979
REACT?

65
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,082
YOU ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A

66
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:51,483
CAMPAIGN?

67
00:01:51,484 --> 00:01:52,484
I KNOW THE PRESIDENT HAS GONE

68
00:01:52,485 --> 00:01:54,085
SOME HEAT FOR CONTINUING THIS

69
00:01:54,086 --> 00:01:56,454
FUND-RAISER AND A RALLY THAT HE

70
00:01:56,455 --> 00:01:58,890
IS DOING IN ERIE, PENNSYLVANIA,

71
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:01,726
TONIGHT, SO WHAT HAS YOU ARE

72
00:02:01,727 --> 00:02:03,662
BEEN?

73
00:02:03,663 --> 00:02:04,929
>> Rep. DeSANTIS: WE

74
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:05,997
CANCELED OUR FUND-RAISERS AND WE

75
00:02:05,998 --> 00:02:07,699
HAD PUBLIC RALLY SCHEDULED FOR

76
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,467
YESTERDAY AND TODAY AND WE

77
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:10,467
CONVERTED THOSE INTO SUPPLY

78
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:10,802
DRIVES.

79
00:02:10,803 --> 00:02:12,437
WE HAD RENTED A U-HAUL AND WE

80
00:02:12,438 --> 00:02:14,572
HAD PEOPLE COME AND BRING WATER

81
00:02:14,573 --> 00:02:16,641
AND NONPERISHABLE FOOD, BABY

82
00:02:16,642 --> 00:02:18,243
SUPPLIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

83
00:02:18,244 --> 00:02:20,278
WE'VE BEEN LOADING UP THE TRUCK,

84
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:22,080
AND THEN WHAT WE WILL DO IS ONCE

85
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:22,881
THE STORM PASSES AND PEOPLE GET

86
00:02:22,882 --> 00:02:24,916
A SENSE OF WHAT'S NEEDED ON THE

87
00:02:24,917 --> 00:02:26,351
GROUND, WE WILL DRIVE THAT TO

88
00:02:26,352 --> 00:02:29,854
WHEREVER NORTHWEST           INN

89
00:02:29,855 --> 00:02:29,888
WHEREVER NORTHWEST           INR

90
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:29,921
WHEREVER NORTHWEST           INH

91
00:02:29,922 --> 00:02:29,954
WHEREVER NORTHWEST           INE

92
00:02:29,955 --> 00:02:30,021
WHEREVER NORTHWEST           INT

93
00:02:30,022 --> 00:02:30,055
WHEREVER NORTHWEST           INF

94
00:02:30,056 --> 00:02:30,088
WHEREVER NORTHWEST           INO

95
00:02:30,089 --> 00:02:30,121
WHEREVER NORTHWEST           INI

96
00:02:30,122 --> 00:02:30,355
WHEREVER NORTHWEST           INA

97
00:02:30,356 --> 00:02:30,755
IT'S NEEDED.

98
00:02:30,756 --> 00:02:34,259
THAT'S THE BEST WAY WE CAN HELP

99
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:34,659
THE EFFORT.

100
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,629
>> Martha: IT VERY HELPFUL.

101
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,563
LOOKING AT THE POLLS, ANDREW

102
00:02:38,564 --> 00:02:41,266
GILLUM IS NOW UP BY ABOUT 3.7%

103
00:02:41,267 --> 00:02:44,402
IN THE REAL CLEAR AVERAGE OF THE

104
00:02:44,403 --> 00:02:45,070
POLLS.

105
00:02:45,071 --> 00:02:47,672
THESE PROMISING MEDICARE FOR ALL

106
00:02:47,673 --> 00:02:50,875
IN FLORIDA, AND A $15 MINIMUM

107
00:02:50,876 --> 00:02:51,609
WAGE IS A PROGRESSIVE CANDIDATE

108
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,977
AND HE'S DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB

109
00:02:52,978 --> 00:02:53,678
AT FUND-RAISING.

110
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:55,313
I THINK IT'S GOT MORE MONEY THAN

111
00:02:55,314 --> 00:02:56,414
YOU DO AT THIS POINT.

112
00:02:56,415 --> 00:02:58,616
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE REASON

113
00:02:58,617 --> 00:03:01,653
THAT YOU ARE BEHIND RIGHT NOW?

114
00:03:01,654 --> 00:03:04,222
>> WELL, THESE ELECTIONS, PEOPLE

115
00:03:04,223 --> 00:03:06,024
START TO FOCUS I THINK AROUND

116
00:03:06,025 --> 00:03:06,858
THIS TIME.

117
00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:08,860
I THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET ON

118
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:11,930
THE DEBATES STAGE TOGETHER VERY

119
00:03:11,931 --> 00:03:12,664
SOON.

120
00:03:12,665 --> 00:03:15,033
I WELCOME FOX NEWS, YOU END UP

121
00:03:15,034 --> 00:03:16,000
BREAD TO DO ONE IN THE GENERAL

122
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:19,771
LIKE YOU DID IN THE PRIMARY, AND

123
00:03:19,772 --> 00:03:21,039
WE WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

124
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,474
REALLY SHOW THE DIFFERENCES

125
00:03:22,475 --> 00:03:25,477
BETWEEN THE TWO CANDID

126
00:03:25,478 --> 00:03:26,244
CANDIDATES.

127
00:03:26,245 --> 00:03:31,383
I WOULD STAY TUNED ON THIS RACE,

128
00:03:31,384 --> 00:03:35,053
AND WE GOT THE MOMENTUM.

129
00:03:35,054 --> 00:03:36,921
>> A WHILE BACK, WE TALKED ABOUT

130
00:03:36,922 --> 00:03:39,524
YOU TEACHING YOUR KIDS ABOUT

131
00:03:39,525 --> 00:03:40,992
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

132
00:03:40,993 --> 00:03:42,594
YOU CAME OUT IN LATE SEPTEMBER

133
00:03:42,595 --> 00:03:45,463
AND SAID, I AM MY OWN MAN, WHEN

134
00:03:45,464 --> 00:03:47,198
YOU ASKED ABOUT THE HURRICANE

135
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:53,872
RESPONSE IN PUERTO RICO.

136
00:03:53,873 --> 00:03:55,640
IS THAT WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO

137
00:03:55,641 --> 00:03:58,676
WIN THE RACE?

138
00:03:58,677 --> 00:04:00,278
>> IF YOU SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT

139
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:02,514
LIKE I   I HAVE ON A LOT OF KEY

140
00:04:02,515 --> 00:04:04,082
ISSUES, THEY SAY ALL YOU DO IS

141
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,250
DO A TRUMP ONE.

142
00:04:05,251 --> 00:04:07,085
THEN IF YOU DO ANYTHING THAT IS

143
00:04:07,086 --> 00:04:09,087
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT, THEY

144
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,555
SAY, OH, MY GOSH, YOU ARE DOING

145
00:04:10,556 --> 00:04:11,489
THAT.

146
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,124
I THINK THE CONFLICT IS

147
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,660
SOMETHING THAT THE PRESS TRIES

148
00:04:15,661 --> 00:04:16,494
TO DO.

149
00:04:16,495 --> 00:04:17,829
AS GOVERNOR, THE GOOD THING THAT

150
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:18,929
I WILL BE ABLE TO DELIVER FOR

151
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,398
FLORIDA IS, I HAVE A POSITIVE

152
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,101
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESIDENT

153
00:04:23,102 --> 00:04:25,670
AND KEY PEOPLE IN THE

154
00:04:25,671 --> 00:04:26,471
ADMINISTRATION.

155
00:04:26,472 --> 00:04:28,373
FLORIDA HAS A LOT OF NEEDS FROM

156
00:04:28,374 --> 00:04:29,073
OUR MILITARY FOOTPRINT,

157
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:29,674
TRANSPORTATION AND WATER

158
00:04:29,675 --> 00:04:31,276
RESOURCES WHICH HAS BEEN A BIG

159
00:04:31,277 --> 00:04:33,478
PROBLEM HERE AND WE NEED TO WORK

160
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:34,212
CONSTRUCTIVELY WITH THE FEDERAL

161
00:04:34,213 --> 00:04:35,814
GOVERNMENT.

162
00:04:35,815 --> 00:04:38,550
ANDREW GILLUM HAS BEEN RUNNING

163
00:04:38,551 --> 00:04:39,250
ON DONALD TRUMP, AND I DON'T

164
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:41,052
THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO

165
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:41,953
ANYTHING PRODUCTIVELY WITH THE

166
00:04:41,954 --> 00:04:43,154
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WE WILL

167
00:04:43,155 --> 00:04:44,289
BE ABLE TO DO THAT.

168
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,857
I THINK THAT'S A CLEAR

169
00:04:45,858 --> 00:04:47,692
DISTINCTION IN TERMS OF WHAT THE

170
00:04:47,693 --> 00:04:49,060
VOTERS OF FLORIDA WOULD GET OUT

171
00:04:49,061 --> 00:04:50,695
OF A GOVERNOR.

172
00:04:50,696 --> 00:04:51,529
I WILL BE ABLE TO ADVANCE

173
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,231
FLORIDA'S PRIORITIES AND I DON'T

174
00:04:53,232 --> 00:04:54,532
THINK YOU WELL.

175
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:56,100
>> Martha: WE WOULD LOVE TO

176
00:04:56,101 --> 00:00:00,000
COME DOWN AND SEE THE DEBATE,
