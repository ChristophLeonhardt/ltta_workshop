These are the Koch
brothers.
The billionaire industrialists
are frequent targets
of Democrats
for being mega-donors
to various Republicans.
But now their powerful
political network
is taking a hard line against
President Trump’s tariffs
and threatening to
withhold support
for Republicans who support
the president on trade
and other issues.
This is a video that
Charles Koch released
during a retreat for
his network supporters
over the weekend.
“We’re seeing a rise
in protectionism.
The urge to protect
ourselves from change
has doomed many countries
throughout history.
And this protectionist
mind-set has destroyed
countless businesses as well.”
The Kochs’ new strategy
could complicate
Republicans’ efforts to
keep control of the House.
Recently, Koch-affiliated
political groups have pushed
back against the
president’s tariffs —
“To keep growing,
we must keep trading.
Tariffs
are not the answer.”
— sometimes reaching out to
the blue-collar demographic
so critical to Trump’s win
in 2016.
“Because of new tariffs
our farmers’ livelihoods
are at risk.
Carmakers, factory
workers and manufacturers, too.”
The Koch-backed
Americans for Prosperity
also refuse to support the
North Dakota Republican
Senate candidate,
Kevin Cramer,
who is running
against a vulnerable Democrat
incumbent, Heidi Heitkamp.
Trump took to
Twitter on Wednesday
to blast the Koch brothers,
calling them “a total joke,”
and “against strong borders
and powerful trade.”
The conflict is just
the latest example
of the rift forming
between Republicans
who believe in free
markets
and a protectionist president.
