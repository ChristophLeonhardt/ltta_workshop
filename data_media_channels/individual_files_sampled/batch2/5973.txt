okay well what did we what is what is today's spectacle what have we witnessed it is the perfect Rorschach test of this entire Russia investigation if you came in thinking that Peter struck as the villain that he was up to no good there's plenty of you know material there that you can use to validate your view if you have a different view if you heard you know the questions about him on the other side which is that the fact that the FBI disclosed and discussed this investigation into Hillary Clinton in ways that demonstrably hurt her while concealing the investigation into Donald Trump and his campaign and potential investigation I'm sorry potential collusion coordination with Russia and ways that would have hurt him if that was disclosed if this was a conspiracy by the FBI it was a pretty lousy one okay but I think it's important to say you just ran all this no bold strike you know we're you know talking about this guy who was escorted from the FBI premises a month ago this is a guy who the Inspector General of the Justice Department said had exposed bias in his own personal Connie emails and texts using a government phone he says he doesn't have bias the a the IG of the the inspector general appointed by Obama or was inspectors own during the Obama years as well the Trump years said he could not say that bias did not affect Peter Struck's behavior here and robert muller fired struck from his investigation he also said well would they can't say about they know that his bias didn't impact the larger right but mauler had to have him remove it from the investigation a month in when he found out about these texts between him and his former mistress he did believe and published well before six before they went public is an important a very important it is except that by point is that struck was a major figure in the Trump and Hillary investigations from the summer of 2015 through the Muller appointment in 2017 and Muller said oh this is bad news you got to get out of here so but before we celebrate his wonderful testimony about the about how no one and he has no bias and no one has any bias the facts of his own conduct need to be known right well no actually no I that is a question I have why is this public today the investigation what why is this in front of TV cameras isn't if we're in the middle of an investigation why ask him questions he can't answer because this is what happens when the conservative media infrastructure bangs a certain drum and a certain message and then the the mainstream media often is forced to cover that controversy that the right-wing media has been focused on for many many many months this hearing today was not for CNN it wasn't for us here at MSNBC it was specifically for the audience at Fox News they believe that Peter struck was completely biased in this investigation is a witch-hunt and so what Republicans did today was reiterate that message and grill him so that they can show it tonight on television and the audience that already is pre conditioned to believe that he is corrupt in the sophistication is corrupt they're gonna be fed that specific message and this was for them and the real issue of bias there to John's point you know if I can pick up on that it can either be proven or refuted definitively the IG report hedged on this claim so they cannot rule it out but they're not accusing him of this either and this is where you get to a he-said she-said where people can make up their own minds if people can see into it whatever they want while the house is investigating and bringing Peter struck for this long Inquisition the people they're not bringing in metaphor and gates Don jr. Kushner this shot is the investigation that is undergoing they're investigating the investigators they prefer that John this is the part of this that I'm just sort of there's no part of holding this hearing in the midst of this that feels responsible this feels like an irresponsible action by Trey Gallagher okay so I think you cannot look at the release of the IG report on the Hillary Clinton investigation that mentions all of this and say that the FBI and not just about Trump but about Hillary Clinton this report was savage about James Comey the head of the FBI and his conduct in the Hillary Clinton investigation and whether or not that had a material role in changing the results of the election so what this goes to why didn't you show me up here today well he should be if this is nobody right then then it's the wrong person new news in in the IG report was the discovery of these texts that mysteriously never made it to Congress Congress had subpoena that had gotten all this information on what was going on in the mid-year exam and the truth which was the Hillary term and the operation I can't Grey Goose what the hell it was called the Trump Organization and for some reason some of these texts from struck had not did not make it from Justice to Congress and when the IG report came out they had this thing where true struck said to his girlfriend we'll stop it now okay you want to say that that's innocent that's fine you can't let me zoom that it's inland let me play one of those changes the number three he was he was in the Hillary Clinton did not go and do anything that would align with what he that's the important point on his but that's that is the exculpatory part of his story and the fact that that the Trump investigation would remain silent before the election and Hillary was obviously partially undone by the revelation of the into her I want to go back so that's his that's his defense and it's a good one I'm not saying it's not I think that there is a larger that there is an agreed-upon larger good government aspect that could be conducted here but let me play you this this today was a circus today has been is awful it hasn't been a good government moment take a listen I don't give a damn what you appreciate agents truck I don't appreciate having an FBI agent with an unprecedented level of animus working on two major investigations during 2016 if it's so frustrating answer the question if you'll allow him to I'm sure he will he has never answered the question who I can't help but wonder when I see you looking there with a little smirk how many times did you two look so innocent into your wife's eyes and lied to her about mr. Spearman it's outrageous ability look this committee is always filled like I always said with the people that leadership doesn't want to see in front of donors I hate to say it whether it's on the Democratic side of the Republican side this committee gets filled up with those folks and it gave us that hearing jury that was an ugly moment and I mean I knew that comment about the medication was coming and still it's dry Wow look at the American government on display that is all irrelevant all of his affair all of that is irrelevant to whether or not the alleged bias impacted his conduct in the investigation it did not and so I think that the hearings should have been over several hours before and it was not because we went over the same text messages over and over and over and we get the point he said the word impeachment maybe he should've had it doesn't seem like it's done for television cameras one can have shocked that that happened that's a congressional anytime yes a congressional hearing makes it to a network like I'll see ya it is not a good moment for democracy because as as Bismarck said about negotiating with I think France it's like it's like a sausage factory you don't want to know how the sausage is made and the House of Representatives in defense of you know his will stop this was he in his view we was the American voter he was American we as the FBI again people can believe whatever they want about this it was weird pointed out that there are many many Republicans worse things those politicians are elected he is hate an official of the FBI investigating candidates and he is also under there he is under the under the provisions of the Hatch Act was personal views on one hand and professional do me a favor what part of today was bad for Vladimir Putin none of it everything goal is to divide Americans from within this was a spectacular showing of success and I think that was his intention in the hack in the first place it wasn't necessarily explicitly to elect Donald Trump to get the lottery it was about it was just so discord and he's been very successful in doing that even if that predates Trump that goal but remember Trey got one thing you have to say is whatever you think about trey gowdy he is retiring he's leaving he's leaving the Congress he's a very excitable and hot-tempered guy but he's earnest and he wasn't doing this for he's not getting anything from the cameras for doing this he's got a thing he thinks that he's been misled now louie gohmert who was the guy who said the thing about the affair he's scum that's scum that was a scummy loathsome thing to do he's a loathsome politician it's everything you hate about politicians rolled up in one daddy's a different story you know a lot of Democrats don't like him but I think that absolutely is doing it for the cameras you don't you don't do what he did today or the 11 hours of grilling Hillary Clinton on Benghazi Alessi's here I'm sitting right now he has retired from Congress he is not running in 2018 he doesn't he's not making a Crim campaign commercial he wants to go and practice law he's done with why it's interesting tile to sort of to sort of try to moderate this way I do get the sense that like Gowdy is trying to both appease the angry Trump constituency on his committee and at the same time try to bring others around well the investigation does matter he's still checked he's still chairman of that committee he's still a Republican in the House of Representatives he would not be there if he didn't reflect where the conference was on some level and it's true that in certain ways he has tried to build some bridges at least in the sense of accepting the intelligence community's findings without equivocation that Russia meddled in the election for the purpose of helping elect Trump there many others in the house most of his colleagues don't accept that Devin Nunez has not accepted that trey Gowdy has rights in some ways he will go there and try to build those bridges and sometimes I think he will still be partisan right he is in that he does seem to strategy you know is it Monday trey gowdy sunday trey gowdy tuesday trey gowdy on that was an excitable person hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our channel so thank you now do me a favor subscribe by clicking on that button down there click on any of the videos to watch the latest interviews and highlights from MTV daily and MSNBC you get more meat to press content every morning and the first read newsletter if you're tired of content that you don't know anything about where it came from you don't have to have that problem with us NBC News MSNBC MTP and the Meet the Press mind set right here for you on YouTube subscribe now
