20
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:54,360
here um so with the recent<font color="#CCCCCC"> migrate</font>

21
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,340
migrant crisis globally like discussed

22
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,440
last week on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the line it's causing</font>

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">European countries like Germany and</font>

24
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,730
America to reconsider how the world's

25
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,110
going to deal with immigration in 21st

26
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,270
century I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> curious how North Korean</font>

27
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,770
refugees like Daniel fit into this

28
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,200
global issue and more specifically in

29
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,820
regards to Obama's announcement about

30
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,560
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. accepting 10,000 Syrian</font>

31
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,970
refugees I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering what</font>

32
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,320
responsibility to the nations of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,860
southeast such as you know Thailand

34
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,869
South Korea with what do they have in

35
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:23,549
promoting human rights and helping

36
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,799
refugees in their region and the to what

37
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,330
extent should those countries be held

38
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,640
more accountable by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> west sure that's</font>

39
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,680
a great question a couple parts to it

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,960
first of all North Korean refugees are a

41
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,420
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> unique compared to refugees from</font>

42
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,950
other countries for for obvious reasons

43
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,530
they have some unusual circumstances as

44
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,259
far as coming to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. they're</font>

45
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,659
treated exactly like they would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

46
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,970
refugee from Syria or Iraq or

47
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,500
Afghanistan or any other country they go

48
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,780
through pretty much the same process

49
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,140
after their escape North Korea and make

50
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,790
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> through China to one of those</font>

51
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,520
countries<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Southeast Asia where they</font>

52
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,990
they make contact<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the State</font>

53
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,490
Department<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then get registered as</font>

54
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,259
refugees they go through a vetting

55
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,290
process and then they come<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and get</font>

56
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,568
essentially the same programs that that

57
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:11,790
other people get they<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a stipend they</font>

58
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,220
get some help with job placement

59
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,709
so they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not treated any differently</font>

60
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:19,329
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> they go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> South Korea however they</font>

61
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:21,670
they have a totally different system

62
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,140
South Korea really welcomed with open

63
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,750
arms all defectors from the north and

64
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,840
they get a whole reorientation program

65
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,209
where they're taught you know how to do

66
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:34,260
things that they that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not</font>

67
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">familiar with at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all like shopping in a</font>

68
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:40,329
supermarket using an ATM those types of

69
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:41,530
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we might take for granted</font>

70
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,849
they get taught how to do and then they

71
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:47,500
get some financial assistance from the

72
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">South Korean government for up to five</font>

73
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">years so they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really kind of have a</font>

74
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,450
specialty program and I did talk to some

75
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,519
folks who want to see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. not</font>

76
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily create a special program for</font>

77
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,790
North Koreans but to maybe give some

78
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,189
funding<font color="#CCCCCC"> to NGOs like Liberty in North</font>

79
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:08,409
Korea that try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the transition</font>

80
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:12,220
smoother for North Koreans<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay as to</font>

81
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,590
what those countries in Southeast Asia

82
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,250
are doing they tend to respect the

83
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,900
rights of North Korean refugees there

84
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,150
have been some cases where North Koreans

85
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,129
have been deported back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> North Korea</font>

86
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:27,250
after they arrived in Lao or Thailand

87
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,159
and the State Department you know when I

88
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,959
spoke to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them they told me that they're</font>

89
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:34,449
doing everything they can but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

90
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:36,459
essentially they can't their hands are

91
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:38,109
tied they can try to exert diplomatic

92
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:39,639
pressure but those are sovereign

93
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,440
countries that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of do whatever</font>

94
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,370
they they want unfortunately right yeah

95
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,129
i mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would love to see the u.s.</font>

96
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:50,409
promote more<font color="#CCCCCC"> ngos in korea i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like</font>

97
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:51,519
because it's less of a lonely process

98
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,709
for him<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i just saw on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the article</font>

99
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:55,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the fact he's so isolated you know</font>

100
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,729
and i think south korea i'm assuming

101
00:03:57,729 --> 00:03:59,979
would be far<font color="#CCCCCC"> less isolating then even</font>

102
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:01,180
somewhere like LA where there's a large

103
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">korean a population it's interesting</font>

104
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually I mean there's certainly a</font>

105
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,680
larger population<font color="#CCCCCC"> of North Korean</font>

106
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,650
defectors in South Korea significantly

107
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,510
larger like there's been more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

108
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,238
30,000 but at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time people I</font>

109
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,668
spoke to talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how even there</font>

110
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:20,470
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be kind of looked down upon and</font>

111
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,710
and self isolate so some defectors will

112
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,450
go so far as to like try to change their

113
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,670
accent and not tell people they're from

114
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">Korea just because there's kind of a</font>

115
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,100
stigma<font color="#E5E5E5"> attached with it in the south oh</font>

116
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">wow I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah that's that's credible</font>

117
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,550
but I'm also curious about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Christian</font>

118
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,760
missionary aspect why isn't that process

119
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,490
being handled I mean maybe as someone

120
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">from Brooklyn who's you know doubtful</font>

121
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:48,070
the Christian missionary efforts I guess

122
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,680
I'm curious why our NGO going

123
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,960
organizations doing stuff to make that

124
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,690
process may be more formal I mean it's

125
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,460
difficult I mean China China's

126
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,430
government is is kind of a very strong

127
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,290
government that's very has a lot of

128
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,880
rules that aren't necessarily conducive

129
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,480
to Christians and and they do when when

130
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,160
North Koreans are caught<font color="#CCCCCC"> in China their</font>

131
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,880
setback they that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> China's kind of</font>

132
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,530
alliance with North Korea part of their

133
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,910
deal is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> when they catch a North</font>

134
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,080
Korean and China they'll send them back

135
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,390
so it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be like an underground</font>

136
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,980
operation where these people are

137
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,340
smuggled through China and these these

138
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">Christian churches are not like a church</font>

139
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,730
that you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be familiar with in the</font>

140
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,080
United States it's it's an underground

141
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">Church as some of them are you know</font>

142
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,900
unmarked it's just a house where people

143
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,710
will gather so there that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is part</font>

144
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,020
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> why they're critical to this process</font>

145
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that they they're fly under the radar</font>

146
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,840
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> will welcome these defectors with</font>

147
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,300
open arms and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then introduce them to the</font>

148
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,940
NGOs that then will Shepherd them

149
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,590
through China and to Southeast Asian and

150
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,260
to the US or South Korea okay so it's a

151
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,670
little bit more formal process than it

152
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,380
might seem I mean formal meeting the

153
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,060
fact that it's not there aren't

154
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,980
alternative motives on parts of the

155
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,450
Christian missionaries it's more it is

156
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,950
really about getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the North Koreans</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

157
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,360
better life whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's in South</font>

158
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,880
Korea America yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of them are</font>

159
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,340
ethnic<font color="#E5E5E5"> Koreans themselves living in</font>

160
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,410
China so they they feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a kinship</font>

161
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,120
to these people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are escaping and</font>

162
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,860
some of them live very close to the

163
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">border and can you know even see across</font>

164
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,930
in some cases and see how hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> life is</font>

165
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,030
and so when somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> crosses they they</font>

166
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,590
really feel sympathetic to them and want

167
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,990
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help they share language they</font>

168
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,960
share ancestry and you know it is an

169
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,810
altruistic<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christian thing that they're</font>

170
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,750
they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that's great thank</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much I appreciate you answering</font>

172
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,689

00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:41,519
now great question thank you yeah and

174
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:43,439

177
00:06:48,989 --> 00:06:52,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">Matty B boy Hey Jude Matthew wants to</font>

178
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:54,809
know escape to the US that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one hell of</font>

179
00:06:54,809 --> 00:06:58,409
a long tunnel and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

180
00:06:58,409 --> 00:06:59,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">a little tongue-in-cheek there but I</font>

181
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:02,639
suppose Phil's questions a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

182
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,809
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the point what happens the</font>

183
00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:05,819
families of defectors she imagines that

184
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:08,999
the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are DPRK knows when someone</font>

185
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:12,089
is missing<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so I'm addressing the</font>

186
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:13,199
first question how do people actually

187
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,969
even get<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of North Korea and then the</font>

188
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:16,619
second one what happens to their

189
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:19,679
families once there they depart there is

190
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:21,569
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> no tunnels I think that would</font>

191
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:24,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even a tunnel too long for El Chapo</font>

192
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:27,389
to engineer most<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> folks who are</font>

193
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:30,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">escaping a lot of them live in the</font>

194
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:32,879
border regions and are no people who

195
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:35,399
have crossed to go find work in<font color="#E5E5E5"> China</font>

196
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,979
and send money back to their families

197
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:39,929
there there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of bribes involved</font>

198
00:07:39,929 --> 00:07:41,579
you bribe the border guards to get let

199
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:43,829
them you know let you have them let you

200
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:47,610
get across and there's kind of like it's

201
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,110
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a coyote like you'd see</font>

202
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,119
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mexico border but there are our</font>

203
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:52,699
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who worship will Shepherd</font>

204
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:57,959
defectors across the border as for what

205
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:00,149
happens to the families it really varies

206
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:02,729
i mean if it's somebody who is an elite

207
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:06,149
in like<font color="#E5E5E5"> pyongyang for example who's has</font>

208
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:07,979
a high profile is affiliated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

209
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,889
Workers Party certainly they would know

210
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:12,659
when that person goes missing and they

211
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:15,389
their family can be punished in the

212
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:18,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">border regions it's a little less strict</font>

213
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">because there is a history of people</font>

214
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,949
going across to work so if it's a poor

215
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:25,019
family who lives right on the yellow

216
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:28,349
river for example the local authorities

217
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:29,969
might not even notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> if if somebody</font>

218
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:32,909
goes missing however just just recently

219
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:35,429
after this story I wrote<font color="#CCCCCC"> about Daniel</font>

220
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:37,769
came out unrelated to that the North

221
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:41,219
Korean regime had reportedly this is

222
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:44,870
from sources in South Korean media said

223
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,899
that they had cracking down on defectors

224
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:51,449
and would execute soldiers who helped

225
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:53,580
who were caught helping defectors cross

226
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,160
and banish families to like rural<font color="#E5E5E5"> areas</font>

227
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">of North Korea away from their homes so</font>

228
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,000
there is it's a very real risk that

229
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,730
these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> take and that's why Daniel</font>

230
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,650
in the story<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I wrote is it's not</font>

231
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,970
his<font color="#E5E5E5"> real name we don't show his face</font>

232
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,010
because he is worried that on the off

233
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,320
chance that somebody from the North

234
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,480
Korean regime reads the story they could

235
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,720
trace it back and punish his family well

236
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,790
cool uh Matthew<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Phil I hope we</font>

237
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,040
answered your questions I'm Keegan how

238
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,910
do you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> about talking to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody</font>

239
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,350
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> in skype you want to do that yeah</font>

240
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,790
let's do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright let's say he does</font>

241
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:28,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I Keegan how are you I'm</font>

242
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,410
great Zephyr<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 thanks I have a quick</font>

243
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:34,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">question for you and that is a you know</font>

244
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:38,220
after George Bush called North Korea one

245
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,860
of the the axis of evil right this is a

246
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,710
while ago I know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> things got very</font>

247
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,990
tense between our two countries and I

248
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,150
was wondering what kind of undercover

249
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,900
operations have come up that perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

250
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,790
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. is engaged in</font>

251
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,160
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> North Korea like maybe you know the</font>

252
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,260
exploding cigars of Castro or something

253
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,770
like that I mean as as<font color="#CCCCCC"> far as I know</font>

254
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:06,090
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> no ongoing us attempts to kill</font>

255
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,250
Kim jong-un that's that's the stuff of

256
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,160
the interview and Hollywood

257
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,210
interestingly enough however there was a

258
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,970
recent report in the intercept the web

259
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,100
said the intercept that talked about how

260
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,120
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pentagon funded a Christian</font>

261
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,850
missionary organization and had them

262
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,380
smuggle in some kind of like

263
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,800
intelligence gathering devices and tried

264
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,900
to gather intelligence<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what was</font>

265
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,730
happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> North Korea although</font>

266
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're there have questions have been</font>

267
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,880
written<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how effective that was</font>

268
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,530
there was only like three trips at this

269
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,830
group made and it was really didn't seem

270
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,530
like the they were getting any valuable

271
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,390
intelligence from it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and on top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

272
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:48,870
when they use a mission NGO especially a

273
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,210
Christian one like that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

274
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,040
putting people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing legitimate</font>

275
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,220
aid work at risk from you know

276
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,780
retaliation from the North Korean regime

277
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,600
so it's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> delicate and incredibly</font>

278
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,260
difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get any kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

279
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,190
intelligence information like that out

280
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">of North Korea</font>

281
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and then the two followed up I know</font>

282
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">that South Korea fired on North Korea</font>

283
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,620
this last weekend and what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

284
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,960
takeaway from that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that bode for</font>

285
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,150
something larger to come I mean these

286
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,670
these two<font color="#CCCCCC"> countries have been in a state</font>

287
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,410
of they've been technically at war since

288
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,180
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the Korean War in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the 50s</font>

289
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,790
that that ended with an armistice

290
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,100
instead of a peace deal and occasionally

291
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">tensions will flare up for one reason or</font>

292
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,620
another the one before that incident you

293
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,050
reference was a South Korean soldier

294
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,970
stepped on the land mine<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the DMZ and</font>

295
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,970
that led to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of threats on on both</font>

296
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,940
sides and ramping up where Kim Jong moon

297
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,480
said that prepared his his military for

298
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,310
a state<font color="#E5E5E5"> of semi war i think is what he</font>

299
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,380
called it so those those happen from

300
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,720
time to time<font color="#E5E5E5"> but i think both countries</font>

301
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,950
ultimately realized that it's in their

302
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,540
best interest to be friendly and even

303
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,210
after that landmine incident you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

304
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,830
North Korea expressed regret and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

305
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,630
they allowed these reunification of

306
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,330
families to happen where they bust

307
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,310
elderly South Koreans who had been

308
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,050
separated<font color="#E5E5E5"> from their their relatives</font>

309
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,360
since the war across the border had kind

310
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,840
of tearful reunions so while there are

311
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,900
occasional flare-ups of of tensions and

312
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,150
austerities usually those get smoothed

313
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,160
over eventually and things kind of go

314
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,820
back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the normal tense but not</font>

315
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,880
imminent danger status quo<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank</font>

know if North Korea fell apart and

319
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,470
unification occurred do you think North

320
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,760
Koreans could cope with the world that's

321
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,290
so different from theirs do you think

322
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,910
they might need like temporary isolation

323
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,980
or something and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to follow</font>

in place<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with the eventual</font>

collapse of the DPRK what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think</font>

328
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,260
sure I mean it would be incredibly

00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">difficult for a lot of North Koreans</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,360
talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier they're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

familiar<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a lot of things that are</font>

334
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,070
in the modern world they have they have

335
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,200
some private market places and they are

336
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,840
more familiar with capitalism but for a

337
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,080
lot of

338
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,510
these folks as it's been explained to me

339
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,310
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be very difficult there</font>

340
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">there would be unemployment widespread</font>

341
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,910
unemployment north Korea has over a

00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">million soldiers that would probably be</font>

343

out of a job suddenly if that happened

344
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,600
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the South Korea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is has made plans</font>

345
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,200
contingency plans for if this happens

346
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,340
most of it has focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what their</font>

347
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,400
military would do in order to you know

348
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,380
establish control and prevent total

349
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,930
chaos in North Korea but there has been

350
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,680
some also economic planning they would

351
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,440
probably partition it so that they would

352
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,970
restrict South Koreans from coming or

353
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,280
North Koreans from going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> south to</font>

00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,200

wreck the economy of<font color="#E5E5E5"> South Korea that</font>

362
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,110
being said I think the South Korea very

363
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,700
much wants to reunify they have a

364
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,220
ministry of unification that deals with

365
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,800
that exact scenario so there are plans

366
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,560
in place but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's so many wild cards</font>

367
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,140
and variables as to exactly how the

368
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,190
regime would collapse and that

369
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,360
transition would happen whether it's

370
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,380
sudden or gradual it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard to</font>

00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">make a definitive plan for something</font>

in reference to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you what the</font>

our documentaries about North Korea that

that might be relevant here about kind

379
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:58,540
of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens when South Koreans our</font>

380
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,420
North Koreans are exposed to media and

423
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,840
wondering if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could maybe talk a</font>

424
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,910
little bit about what it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like for some</font>

425
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,740
of these refugees to assimilate into

426
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,790
these new cultures once they've escaped

427
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:06,880
North Korea what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like any</font>

428

education programs or work placement

429
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,190
programs in place for them and do any of

430
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:15,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">them try to go back yeah absolutely the</font>

431
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,650
story I wrote recently about defectors

who come to the u.s.<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know talking to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">a couple of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these people firsthand and</font>

434
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,430
it's incredibly difficult for them to

435
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:27,430
assimilate I mean I described it in in

436
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,440
the story as like as close as reality

437
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,750
allows to being like dropped into an

438
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,270
alternate universe just because you have

439
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,770
conception of a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

440
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,200
happen in the United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States they've been</font>

441
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,670
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been taught to believe that the</font>

442
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,560
United States is evil a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times</font>

443
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,120
although we know as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as they get to</font>

444
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,260
China they kind of realized that that

445
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,660
might might not be true<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then once</font>

446
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,670
they get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the the United</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> States you</font>

461
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,820
stereotypes of what North Koreans are

who you know Kim jong-un type questions

463
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,530
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing with that is incredibly</font>

464
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,900
difficult for young people their more

465
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,250

so he's doing very well he's successful

471
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">daniel who was the main focus my story</font>

472
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:49,540
he's also you know in once by mini

473
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,430
standards he's doing great he has a job

474
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:55,360
he lives it on his own he's a car but on

475
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,710
the other hand he's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lonely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

476
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,650
mean he<font color="#CCCCCC"> he self isolates I think is how</font>

477
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,810
he would describe it he doesn't really

478
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:02,980
like being around a lot of other people

479
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,250
you know he talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how in North</font>

480
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,410
Korea there's a there's a real

481
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,430
incredibly strong sense of community

482
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,610
that some people miss in a way but your

483
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,140
neighbors know everything about you<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

484
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,610
mean the way he put it to me is like

485
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">they know how many spoons you have in</font>

486
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,050
your drawer in your kitchen so when they

487
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,580
get the opportunity to live on their own

488
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,440
they they kind of want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

489
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,990
that as much as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so they he has</font>

490
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,570
some Korean friends but for the most

491
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,310
part he<font color="#CCCCCC"> just goes to work lives on his</font>

492
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,500
own tries to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make enough money to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get by</font>

493
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,170
so it's a big challenge for these<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

494
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:38,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">who come to the u.s. South Korea makes</font>

495
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,510
it a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier with their</font>

496
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,130
reorientation program that I talked

497
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,600
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit about earlier but even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

498
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,940
they tend to earn less that

499
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're so they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> korean counterparts</font>

500
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:52,200
the unemployment rate is higher they're

501
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">just not used to the world as it is</font>

502
00:19:54,629 --> 00:19:56,879
outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of North Korea and readjusting</font>

503
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:57,990
can be difficult even when they have

504
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:04,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">special programs to help them doesn't do</font>

505
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:07,019
any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them try to go back to North</font>

506
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:08,610
Korea I imagine it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> impossible</font>

507
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,909
yeah that was your<font color="#CCCCCC"> other question and</font>

508
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,440
yes to answer questions some of them do

509
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,409
try to go back there's a high-profile

510
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:20,970
case now in<font color="#E5E5E5"> South Korea where a woman</font>

511
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,629
who's an older woman who defected and is

512
00:20:24,629 --> 00:20:26,639
trying to go back like she's told the

513
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:28,559
government that she wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

514
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,169
illegal under South Korean law to help

515
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:34,080
somebody go to North Korea so even

516
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,669
though she wants to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back she has her</font>

517
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:38,639
family there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and she claims that she led</font>

518
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:40,860
a pretty you know well<font color="#E5E5E5"> it she was</font>

519
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,690
relatively well off and<font color="#E5E5E5"> let it what was</font>

520
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,570
a good life by<font color="#CCCCCC"> North Korean standards</font>

521
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,769
the South Korean government says no way

522
00:20:46,769 --> 00:20:49,799
you can't go so some people have have

523
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,779
tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go back some people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have you</font>

524
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:53,429
know tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to walk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> across the DMZ to go</font>

525
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:57,600

526
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,970
spoke<font color="#CCCCCC"> to he doesn't actively want to go</font>

527
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,549
back right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now but he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was very nostalgic</font>

528
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:06,809
for his hometown his his family and some

529
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:08,610
of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he at home that he</font>

530
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,379
had growing up that he can't get here so

531
00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:13,320
he expressed that if the regime were to

532
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,149
fall and it was safe<font color="#CCCCCC"> for him to go back</font>

533
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,100
he he would do that he would want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

534
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,070
back and become a farmer again which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

535
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,809
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of amazing I mean you think people</font>

536
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:23,850
have such a conception that life in

537
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,409
North Korea is totally awful and

538
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,299
everybody's starving and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

539
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:29,309
basically hell on earth when the truth

540
00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:30,720
is a little more gray than that and some

541
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,389
people actually do miss things about

542
00:21:33,389 --> 00:21:41,519
their their homeland thank you yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

543

547
00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:52,470
lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> were asking us about Kim</font>

548
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,909
jong-un<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this rumor that he might</font>

549
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:58,490
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some some mysterious illness so</font>

550
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:01,920
for jazz not for something I can tell

him I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what that is what are</font>

552
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,450
the chances<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the Supreme Leader is</font>

553
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,800
going to be killed by his inner circle

554
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,800
due to his I constant and quote unquote

555
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:15,450
ailment<font color="#E5E5E5"> rumored illness and also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cillian</font>

556
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,130
Scott wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know is there any</font>

557
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:19,200
evidence<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a quiet uprising</font>

558
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,340
happening inside of the People's

559
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">Republic ah that's both good questions</font>

560
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:27,180
on the first one I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the chances</font>

561
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,160
from what I've been told from people who

562
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,990
know way more about the North Korean

563
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,600
leadership and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the inner</font>

564
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,330
workings of the regime it seems highly

565
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,520
unlikely that Kim jong-un would be

566
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,770
killed by somebody who's in his inner

567
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:43,680
circle he's he's kind of the face he

568
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,710
legitimizes this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> government and</font>

569
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,020
he's they spent all this time building

570
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">about through propaganda to make him be</font>

571
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,430
the supreme leader and he rules on the

572
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,110
authority of<font color="#CCCCCC"> of his dad and his</font>

573
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:58,590
grandfather so<font color="#E5E5E5"> without a kim leading</font>

574
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:02,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">north korea it's really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to envision</font>

575
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:05,100
the people respecting the government

576
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,230
just because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they they've spent so much</font>

577
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,150
time building it up he's he's the the

578
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,580
face he has<font color="#CCCCCC"> the name he has the</font>

579
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,230
resemblance<font color="#CCCCCC"> to his grandfather who's</font>

580
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:16,440
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of revered still among some North</font>

581
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,450
Koreans because times were relatively

582
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:22,650
good back then so even if he he he gets

583
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">sick again they're gonna I think in my</font>

584
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,540
opinion from what I've been told stick

585
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">with him for as long as possible because</font>

586
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:32,100
without<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Kim then the whole regime is</font>

587
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,610
thrown into question as for evidence of

588
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:38,160
rumors<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a quiet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uprising I mean you</font>

589
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,420
hear all kinds of crazy rumors from

590
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,240
North Korea and there is a South Korean

591
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,810
group whose referenced in that

592
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:48,720
documentary we showed earlier who is

593
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,450
prepared to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and fight in North Korea</font>

594
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,460
if the opportunity ever arises but I

595
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,350
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's any indication that</font>

596
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,570
there there is you know active plotting

597
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,370
within the regime that's one of the

598
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,470
things if if it is it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> small</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

599
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,540
it's kept a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very close secret because if</font>

600
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,010
anybody in North Korea<font color="#E5E5E5"> finds out that's</font>

601
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,760
a sure way to get executed and hurry

602
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,600
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that cheerful note</font>

603
