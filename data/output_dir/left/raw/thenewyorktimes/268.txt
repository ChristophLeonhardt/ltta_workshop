1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:04,700
Hummingbirds are pure
delight, shimmering colors,

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,740
wings beating up to
80 times a second.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,070
But there’s a furnace
beneath those feathers.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,350
This is infrared, a glimpse of
a hummingbird’s internal heat.

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,630
Metabolism at full burn.

6
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,700
When a hummingbird is
hovering with its heart

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,400
beating more than
1,000 times a minute,

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,740
it burns more energy,
ounce for ounce,

9
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,630
than any other bird or mammal.

10
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,370
But wait, here’s that same bird
at night with its metabolism

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,350
slowed to a crawl.

12
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,330
It’s in a state called torpor.

13
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,950
Heartbeat and
temperature have dropped

14
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,440
so low that the
bird is using 1/50th

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,050
of the energy it would use
if it were zooming around

16
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,460
during the day.

17
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,060
Good thing, otherwise in
eight hours without feeding,

18
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,840
it could starve to death.

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,220
No wonder scientists have
long studied these birds.

20
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,910
Ken Welch, for one, has spent
more than a decade figuring out

21
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,609
how these birds manage
their energy budgets.

22
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:00,900
“I learned to become a bit of
the hummingbird whisperer.

23
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,129
And eventually I figured out
how to think like a hummingbird

24
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:06,470
and how to get
them to cooperate.”

25
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,660
Here’s how their
metabolism works.

26
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,760
Hummingbirds are much
better than most animals

27
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,480
at switching between fat and
sugar to power their muscles.

28
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,750
And since they feed on nectar
that is half glucose and half

29
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,380
fructose, they’ve evolved a way
to send that fructose directly

30
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,160
to their muscles to use.

31
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,880
Humans mainly fuel their
bodies through glucose.

32
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,720
For us fructose, as in
high fructose corn syrup,

33
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,340
goes straight to fat.

34
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,170
And even glucose doesn’t move
to human muscles as quickly.

35
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,380
But hummingbirds can
essentially mainline nectar.

36
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,740
In 15 minutes, their
flight muscles

37
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,920
are burning sugars that
they have just swallowed.

38
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,080
In order to study
these birds, Welch

39
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,660
has to train them to hover
and drink with their head

40
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,170
in a mask that
measures oxygen use.

41
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,010
The mask is a lot
like those used

42
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,390
on humans with a slight
difference in results.

43
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,140
“Their metabolic rate
when they’re hovering

44
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,380
is, pound for pound, 10 times
what an elite human athlete

45
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,400
can achieve.”

46
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,000
What Welch and his colleagues
have studied recently

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,730
is how size relates
to energy efficiency.

48
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,220
Some hummingbirds weigh
less than a penny.

49
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,970
Some way 10 times more,
almost a full ounce.

50
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,790
As you can see little birds
have to beat their wings

51
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,240
a lot faster to hover.

52
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,030
And what Welch discovered is
that the faster the wing beats,

53
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,630
the less efficient
the energy use.

54
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,170
What does it all mean?

55
00:02:27,170 --> 00:00:00,000
Hummingbirds are pure delight,
both to the eye and to science.
