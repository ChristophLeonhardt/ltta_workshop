point where everything that we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,200
understand about physics is no longer

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:10,769
valid I think one of the reasons black

4
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:13,500
holes are so enigmatic right is that in

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,260
a way it's quite problematic even for

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,730
astrophysicists and physicists to

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,289
reconcile these sort of two different

8
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,740
views so on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one hand a black hole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,170
the sort of mathematical entity it's a

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">solution to Einstein's equations of a</font>

11
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,840
point mass of a very compact dense mass

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,630
that warps space-time very very

13
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,280
dramatically almost to the point of a

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">puncher and the black hole is defined as</font>

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,760
having a region<font color="#E5E5E5"> and event horizon which</font>

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,710
is the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of no return even for light</font>

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,530
and that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> region encases a</font>

18
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,660
singularity a point where all the laws

19
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,399
known laws of physics actually break

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,610
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what we don't really have is a</font>

21
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,090
detailed quantum understanding of the

22
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,609
structure of this really<font color="#CCCCCC"> small scale</font>

23
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:02,129
thing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know it remains to be</font>

24
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,530
understood it's a it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> an open problem</font>

25
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,150
that lots of people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on and</font>

26
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,790
then there's the view of a black hole as

27
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,330
the end product<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the life cycle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

28
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,820
star so I think in a way right so that's

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,159
an Astrophysical object it has mass it's

30
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,530
the left over after the implosion of a

31
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,580
big star and so in a way the enigmatic

32
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:27,030
and sell these two views and these two

33
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,909
views are problematic particularly

34
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:32,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they in case the singularity the</font>

35
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,500
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of point where everything that we</font>

36
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,119
know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand about physics is no</font>

37
00:01:36,119 --> 00:00:00,000
longer valid
