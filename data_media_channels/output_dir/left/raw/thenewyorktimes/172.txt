1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,220
Melania Trump. Is she trapped?
A reluctant first lady?

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,390
Or is she poised, polished,

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,040
and a quiet, but supportive
first lady?

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,490
Who is the real Melania?

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,660
Very few, at least among those

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,590
who are speaking publicly,
will say.

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,270
“I'm very strong.
People they don’t really know me.

8
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,380
People think
and talk about me like,

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,979
‘Oh Melania. Oh poor Melania.’

10
00:00:30,979 --> 00:00:32,870
Don’t feel sorry for me.

11
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,440
Don’t feel sorry for me.

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,590
I can handle everything.”

13
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,930
But as Donald Trump’s
presidency has progressed,

14
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,330
the first lady has become
a versatile avatar.

15
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,600
Her image split sharply
down political lines.

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,120
In one version of the
public imagination

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,280
Melania is unhappy.

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,940
She dislikes her husband and
disagrees with his policies.

19
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,170
She may even be
mulling a divorce.

20
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,800
This Melania has shown
up on late night T.V.

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,030
and in tabloids.

22
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,490
“Your beautiful, dutifully Melania.

23
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,770
I can’t take it anymore.”

24
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,320
Then there’s the other
version of Melania,

25
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,240
painted by conservative
media as confident,

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,880
fashion forward, graceful
and adored.

27
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,470
“I have been so impressed 
with, not just her quiet dignity,

28
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,400
as you brought up,

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,950
but also just this
diplomatic use of fashion.

30
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,650
This version is closer to the
official portrayal of Melania.

31
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,030
Through her spokespeople,

32
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,980
the first lady says she is
supportive of her husband

33
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,140
and focused on raising
their son, Barron.

34
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,410
“I support my
husband 100 percent.

35
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:41,790
But we have a 9-year-old son together,
Barron.

36
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,580
And I’m raising him.”

37
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,460
She says she prefers to take
a back seat to her husband,

38
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,702
to keep his place
in the limelight.

39
00:01:49,392 --> 00:01:50,410
It’s not the first time

40
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,450
Melania's been in the public eye.

41
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,940
“You spin, baby, you spin.”

42
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,630
She’s a former model.

43
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,550
And jewelry designer.

44
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,810
“I love when idea comes to life.

45
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,980
And I study
architecture and design

46
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,560
and it's something
very creative for me.”

47
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,150
“I’m very passionate
about what I design,

48
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,130
and there are some beautiful
pieces.”

49
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,190
When they got together
in the late 1990s,

50
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,730
the Trumps say
their chemistry was instant.

51
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,830
“We were both at
the same party

52
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,680
and that’s how we met.
He came to me...”

53
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,680
“Like her right away?”

54
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,050
“I went crazy.”

55
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,800
Melania and Donald 
became synonymous

56
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,230
with the New York social scene.

57
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,880
“They've stood did together
for a number of years now.

58
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,330
New Yorkers have
come to know them

59
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,820
as a very solid couple.

60
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,170
And in 2005, they married.

61
00:02:37,105 --> 00:02:40,605
“Hi, fans. I'm going to 
Metropolitan gala.”

62
00:02:40,605 --> 00:02:42,190
In the following years,

63
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,000
Melania's social media posts
focused on fashion, travel,

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,240
fitness, and spending
time with family.

65
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,820
Now as the first lady,
next to one of the most

66
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,130
outspoken presidents
in recent history,

67
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,670
Melania's silence has
taken on a life of it's own.

68
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,480
“The most important
thing is just to be you.

69
00:03:06,920 --> 00:00:00,000
That’s the end.”
