CONCESSION.
SO WHERE DOES THE STORY GO NOW?
GENERAL JACK KEANE, MARC
THEISSEN AND MARIE HARF ON DECK
TONIGHT.
SENATOR GRAHAM, ALWAYS GOOD TO
SEE YOU, THANKS FOR BEING HERE
TONIGHT.
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO THE
PRESIDENT ABOUT HOW HE DID?
>> GREAT JOB.
I THINK IT'S A GOOD FIRST STEP.
HE FELT GOOD ABOUT IT.
HE SAID I HAD A GOOD MEETING
WITH KIM JONG UN.
WHAT REALLY STRUCK ME AS HE SAID
LISTEN, THIS HAS GOT TO COME TO
AN END.
WE CAN'T LIVE WITH THIS KIND OF
THREAT.
HE'S GOT TO GIVE UP HIS NUCLEAR
PROGRAM.
I WANT TO MAKE IT A WIN-WIN.
A WAR WOULD BE DEVASTATING.
I DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN THAT
ROAD.
HE FELT PRETTY GOOD ABOUT THE
INITIAL MEETING.
WE'VE GOT A LONG WAY TO GO, BUT
WHAT STRUCK ME THE MOST IS HOW
MUCH THE PRESIDENT APPRECIATED
HOW DEVASTATING A WAR WOULD BE,
BUT IT WOULD BE EVEN MORE
DEVASTATING TO WALK AWAY FROM
HIS NUCLEAR THREAT.
HE'S GOING TO END IT ON HIS
WATCH IS WHAT HE TOLD ME.
>> Martha: FASCINATING.
THIS IS RAND PAUL SPEAKING OUT
ABOUT SOMETHING THAT YOU SET
ABOUT ALL OF THIS EARLIER.
>> IN THE MIDST OF A HISTORIC
OPENING, PRESIDENT TRUMP
ACTUALLY HAVING FACE-TO-FACE
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LEADER OF
NORTH KOREA, LINDSEY GRAHAM
TRYING TO DECLARE WAR IN THE
MIDDLE OF THAT IS, I DON'T KNOW,
SOMEONE LIVING IN AN ALTERNATIVE
UNIVERSE.
IT'S NOT REALLY HELPFUL IN THE
MIDDLE OF AN OPENING TO ACTUALLY
TALK ABOUT IF WE DON'T LIKE THIS
WE ARE GOING TO BOMB THEM OR
DECLARE WAR ON THEM.
>> Martha: ARE YOU TRYING TO
DECLARE WAR ON NORTH KOREA,
SENATOR  ?
>> I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO
PREVENT ONE.
HERE'S WHAT I BELIEVE ABOUT
NORTH KOREA.
THEY WOULDN'T BE TALKING TO
TRUMP A LIST THEY BELIEVED HE
WAS SERIOUS ABOUT USING MILITARY
FORCE.
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DONE MORE IN
500 DAYS TO DEAL WITH
NORTH KOREA THAN EVERY PRESIDENT
IN THE LAST 30 YEARS.
HERE'S WHAT THE CHOICES ARE FOR
NORTH KOREA.
COLUMN A'S ECONOMIC INCENTIVES,
SECURITY GUARANTEES, A GOOD LIFE
FOR NORTH KOREA AND SECURITY FOR
THE REGIME.
COLUMN B IS GOING TO BE THE
DESTRUCTION OF THE REGIME IF YOU
DON'T GIVE UP YOUR NUCLEAR
WEAPONS PROGRAM.
PRESIDENT TRUMP WASN'T KIDDING
WHEN HE SAID HE WOULD USE
MILITARY FORCE.
IT IS THE LAST OPTION.
CONTRARY TO WHAT SENATOR PAUL
SAYS, THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING
TO GET NORTH KOREA TO GIVE UP
THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM IS
FOR THEM TO BELIEVE THEY ARE
BETTER OFF WITHOUT IT THEN WITH
IT, AND THAT COMES DOWN TO TRUMP
CONVINCING THEM THAT THEY CAN NO
LONGER GO ON THE PATH THEY ARE
GOING WITHOUT A FIGHT.
>> Martha: THAT'S WHAT I FOUND
FASCINATING LAST NIGHT, BECAUSE
THE ONE THING THAT WE KNOW FOR
SURE IS THAT THE STATUS QUO
CANNOT STAY.
THAT'S WHAT THE NORTH KOREAN
DICTATOR HAS FIGURED OUT, NO
DOUBT.
THAT'S WHY HE SHOWED UP TO TALK
ABOUT THIS, BECAUSE HE KNOWS
HE'S GOT PRESSURES AT HOME AS
WELL.
HE'S GOT THIS LITTLE SMALL
GROWING ELITE CLASS WHICH IS
MINOR, BUT THEY ARE PUSHING BACK
ON HIM AND HE'S GOT THIS OTHER
CHOICE THAT IF HE GOES BACK TO
WHAT HE WAS DOING BEFORE, FIRING
MISSILES ACROSS THE OCEAN AND
TESTING NUCLEAR MISSILES
POTENTIALLY THAT WE ARE GOING TO
START FIRING BACK.
>> CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT WOULD
HAPPEN IF KIM JONG UN THREW A
FIT AND WALKED AWAY AND SAID I'M
DONE WITH DONALD TRUMP AND FIRED
A MISSILE OVER JAPAN?
WHAT DO YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP
WOULD DO?
HE WOULD SEE THAT AS A
PROVOCATIVE ACT AGAINST THE
UNITED STATES AND HE WOULD
RETALIATE.
WHAT SENATOR PAUL DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND IS THAT YOU ARE
CUTTING THE LEGS OUT FROM
PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN YOU TALK
ABOUT YOU WERE NOT REALLY
SERIOUS ABOUT THE MILITARY
OPTION.
I DON'T WANT TO, IT WOULD BE
DEVASTATING AS A LAST RESORT,
BUT IF NORTH KOREA DOESN'T
BELIEVE THAT WE ARE SERIOUS
ABOUT THE MILITARY OPTION, YOU
ARE NEVER GOING TO GET A
PEACEFUL RESULT.
>> Martha: HERE'S DENNIS
RODMAN.
I WANT TO PLAY THIS, THIS IS
JAMES CLAPPER PRAISING DENNIS
RODMAN.
WATCH THIS.
>> YOU'RE KIDDING ME!
>> I HAVE LONG BEEN AN ADVOCATE
OF INVOLVING DENNIS RODMAN.
HE IS A UNIQUE PERSON SINCE HE
HAS A RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH
KIM JONG UN AND WITH
DONALD TRUMP.
>> Martha: LINDSEY GRAHAM?
>> I WOULD RATHER HAVE TRUMP IN
THE ROOM THEN DENNIS RODMAN.
I HOPE JAMES CLAPPER UNDERSTANDS
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BROUGHT
THIS HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY ABOUT
BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN STRONG IN
THE FACE OF AGGRESSION.
IF HE TO END THIS NUCLEAR THREAT
BUT IF HE HAS TO USE FORCE HE
WILL.
DENNIS RODMAN IS NOT THE KEY TO
A GOOD OUTCOME IN NORTH KOREA.
IT'S DONALD J. TRUMP.
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DONE A GOOD
THING, A GOOD SERVICE TO THE
COUNTRY, MAYBE TO NORTH KOREA.
IF THEY ARE SMART ENOUGH TO TAKE
THIS DEAL.
I'VE GOT YOUR BACK, NOBODY WANTS
A WAR BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU,
MR. PRESIDENT, MAKE SURE HE GETS
RID OF HIS NUCLEAR WEAPONS
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
>> Martha: WANT TO ASK YOU ONE
MORE QUESTION ABOUT ROB
ROSENSTEIN AND THIS STORY TO
MAKE.
BASICALLY THAT THERE ARE
SHOUTING MATCH THAT HAPPENED IN
ONE OF THESE MEETINGS AND THAT
HE THREATEN MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE
INTEL COMMITTEE WITH SUBPOENAING
THEM.
HE SAID I WANT TO SEE YOUR
EMAILS.
LET ME TURN THE SUBPOENA GAME ON
YOU GUYS.
>> WE HAVE A DUTY TO OVERSEE THE
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND HERE'S
WHAT I SAY TO MR. ROSENSTEIN.
YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WAS OFF
THE RAILS, YOU ARE CLEARLY NOT
LOOKING AT THE SAME DEPARTMENT
OF JUSTICE I'M LOOKING AT.
YOU DON'T NEED THE FBI WAS IN
THE TANK FOR CLINTON AND HATED
TERMS WERE NOT LOOKING AT THE
DETAILS THAT ARE THERE TO BE
SEEN.
DON'T BE UPSET BECAUSE WE ARE
CALLING YOU OUT FOR HAVING A
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT IS
OUT OF CONTROL.
THE HOUSE HAS A DUTY TO OVERSEE
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.
SO DOES THE SENATE AND WE ARE
NOT GOING TO BE THREATENED BY
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, WE
WILL BE THREATENED BY
PROFESSIONAL OVERSIGHT.
>> Martha: I TOLD THAT THAT
HAPPENS ON A REGULAR BASIS.
>> AT JUST ABOUT HAD IT WITH THE
ROSENSTEIN APPROACH HER.
>> Martha: WHAT HAPPENS?
WHERE DOES THIS END?
