>> Bret: THIS IS A PRIMARY DAY
IN PENNSYLVANIA, AND A FEW OTHER
STATES AS WELL.
IN P.A., VOTERS ARE
PARTICIPATING UNDER A NEWLY
DRAWN CONGRESSIONAL MAP.
REPUBLICANS ARE CHOOSING G.O.P.
CHALLENGERS TO DEMOCRATIC
GOVERNOR TOM WOLF AND BOB CASEY.
ERIC SHAWN IS IN HAZLETON
TONIGHT WITH THE LATEST.
GOOD EVENING, ERIC.
>> GOOD EVENING >> NINE.
SOME THINK THAT THE RACES HERE
IN PENNSYLVANIA COULD EVENTUALLY
HELP TO CONTROL OF THE HOUSE.
IN FACT THE CHAIRMAN OF THE
STATE G.O.P. TODAY PREDICTED
THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY COULD
PICK UP AS MANY AS FIVE SEATS IN
NOVEMBER, AND THE REASON HE SAID
IS IT REDISTRICTING.
TODAY, 84 CANDIDATES ARE RUNNING
IN 18 NEW CONGRESSIONAL
DISTRICTS THAT WERE READ IRAN
AFTER THE STATE SUPREME COURT
RULED THE OLD LINES WERE
PARTISAN AND VIOLATED THE
STATE'S CONSTITUTION.
THE DEMOCRATS SAY THAT RULING
LEAVE END OF THE PLAYING FIELD
BUT REPUBLICANS ARE ANGRY
AGAINST THAT, CRYING FOUL.
MEANWHILE, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
LOOMING LARGE IN THAT SENATE
RACE.
HE HAS ENDORSED CONGRESSMAN LOU
BARLETTA, WHO TODAY WE
INTERVIEWED AND DISCUSSED THE
ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION.
HE MADE NATIONAL HEADLINES IN
2006 TARGETING THAT ISSUE WHEN
THE CITY ENACTED LAWS THAT DENY
PERMITS TO BUSINESSES WHO HIRED
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, LANDLORDS
WHO RENTED TO ILLEGALS, AND
DECLARED THAT ENGLISH IS THE
CITY'S OFFICIAL LANGUAGE.
TODAY, HE TOLD US THAT EVEN
THOUGH THOSE LAWS WERE
EVENTUALLY STRUCK DOWN, THEY
REMAIN MEANINGFUL IN THIS
ECONOMICALLY DEPRESSED AREA.
>> THE NATIONAL MEDIA SAID
DONALD TRUMP COULD NEVER WIN
PENNSYLVANIA, BUT DONALD TRUMP
WON PENNSYLVANIA.
THE NATIONAL MEDIA IS SAYING HE
COULD NEVER BEAT BUCK CASEY, BUT
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS HERE
BECAUSE HE HASN'T RESISTED,
OBJECTIVE AND OBSTRUCTED EVERY
SINGLE THING THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS WANTED TO DO
ON HIS AGENDA.
>> ALSO VYING FOR THE G.O.P. NOD
IS STATE REPRESENTATIVE JIM
CHRISTIANA.
HE'S BANKING ON HIS LEGISLATIVE
EXPERIENCE IN HARRISBURG SAYING
HE CAN BRING A BIPARTISAN SPIRIT
TO WASHINGTON.
HE TOLD US HE'S NOT AT ALL
BOTHERED THAT THE PRESIDENT IS
BACKING HIS OPPONENT.
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT THE
PRESIDENT REWARDS LOYALTY, AND I
CAN APPRECIATE THAT.
THERE IS NO HARD FEELINGS.
IF YOU LISTEN TO THE MESSAGE,
IT'S NOT BASED ON MERIT.
AND I THINK THAT MY RECORD COMES
FROM AND SPEAKS FOR THEMSELVES.
>> WHOEVER WINS TONIGHT COULD
HAVE A TOUGH ROW AGAINST THE
INCUMBENT SENATOR.
CASEY IS A THREE TERM INCUMBENT
AND THE SON OF STORIED FORMER
GOVERNOR ROBERT PKC.
WE REACHED OUT TO THE CASEY
CAMPAIGN AND THEY HAVE NOT
REACHED OUT.
THE POLLS CLOSE IN LESS THAN TWO
HOURS AND THE RESULTS TONIGHT
