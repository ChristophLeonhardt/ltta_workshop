the White House is continuing to feel the wrath of some lawmakers after a White House aide mocked Senator John McCain this week as we reported here last night multiple sources say special assistant Kelley Sadler dismissed McCain's opposition to Gina Haspel CIA nomination by saying in a meeting in front of many others quote it doesn't matter he's dying anyway Senator McCain of course is battling brain cancer the comments have generated a whole lot of reaction over the these past 24 hours McCain's fellow Republican senator from Arizona Jeff Flake simply wrote on Twitter quote there are no words Vice President Joe Biden a close friend of McCain's released a statement that read in part quote people have wondered when decency would hit rock bottom with this administration it happened yesterday John McCain is a genuine hero a man of Valor whose sacrifices for his country are immeasurable as he fights for his life he deserves better so much better earlier today on the view senator McCain's daughter Megan McCain responded to Kelly Sadler Holly here's the little news flash and this may be a bit intense for 11 o'clock in the morning on a Friday but we're all dying I'm dying I'm dying or all day yeah and I want to say that mom says my dad has been diagnosed to the past it's almost a year at July 19th mm-hmm I really feel like I understand that meaning of life and it is not how you die it is how you live right I don't understand what kind of environment you're working in when that would be acceptable and then you can come to work the next day and still have a job yeah and that's all I have to say about it the White House has not denied the account of Sadler's comments nor will they apologize no one on the payroll at any level they provided a very brief statement after the news first broke it reads we respect senator McCain's service to our nation and he his family are in her prayers during this difficult time but at today's White House press briefing Sarah Huckabee Sanders dodged all manner of questions related to this matter does she still have a job I'm not gonna comment on an internal staff meeting is the White House not think that you need to contend these remarks and I'm not gonna validate a leak one way or the other out of an internal staff meeting again I'm not gonna validate a leak out of an internal staff meeting meet is there a tone set from the top here where it is allowed for an aide to say he's dying anyway certainly there is not a tone set here we have a respect for all Americans and that is what we try to put forward in everything we do both in word and in action why not gonna get into a back-and-forth because you know people want to create issues of relief leak staffing and it does Kelly Sadler still this White House yes she does does the president set the tone does he bear responsibility for the tone is in this White House the president as I as I mentioned just a moment ago supports all Americans the one guy we wanted to talk to you about this is here with us tonight Steve Schmidt a Republican political veteran of the Bush White House and importantly the John McCain presidential campaign he also proudly is an MSNBC political analyst Steve this this quote and the subsequent hubbub today's briefing have gutted a lot of folks and I know they truly gutted you well they don't say anything about John McCain John McCain's valor his heroism his love of country his perfect love of the country the fact that but for six months when he first ran for Congress that he spent every hour of his adult life from age 17 when he put on the uniform at Annapolis in service to the American nation he is a giant figure in American history he is a giant for the ages he's a living legend he's a statesman a soldier a peacemaker one of the things we don't talk enough about is the role that he played along with John Kerry and bringing reconciliation between the United States and Vietnam peace so that this generation of Americans can be in peace with Vietnam and that we could be friends I was there a couple of weeks ago and he is revered there not as a warrior but as a peacemaker as he is in many many parts of the of the world and so the greatness of John McCain is not dispensed by this White House what would her comments show is the viciousness the cruelty the meanness this culture of bullying this toxic miasma of constant putrid crap that emerges out of this White House she's obviously a perfect fit for it one more disgrace one more member of a team that's doing real damage real Sundering to this country real staining of national fabric so this great man the judgment of Donald Trump matters not Donald Trump frankly in my view is unworthy to say John McCain's name out loud and and the reason I suspect the McCain's don't want Donald Trump anywhere near John McCain's funeral is the point that Megan made earlier it's about how you live your life and John McCain's led a big life a glorious life a life of service to others its service to the country Donald Trump's life has been the story of selfishness of greed he's never sacrificed anything for anyone he's a con man and does anybody have any doubt that Donald Trump was sitting in that Vietnamese torture cage and they asked him if he wanted to go home early what he would do the man is a coward John McCain is a hero and that's why those two men are different Steve John McCain also knows who his friends are and there he is at his beautiful ranch in Arizona he's been visited by so many of them over these past few weeks as he deals with his illness where are are you frustrated at all that other your friends and other Republicans have not risen up have not raised their weapons and gone into the battle these past two days look there's nobody who loves a good saloon fight more than John McCain and so if if it's time for a saloon fight so be it but but but it's not about John McCain it's about the values that John McCain is stood for selflessness service sacrifice valor valor that beggars the imagination they're good and they're right and these were the values and the virtues that built the United States of America we're a flawed people John McCain's a flawed man but the idea of America the nation that said all men are created equal and are endowed by their creator with inalienable rights life liberty and the pursuit of happiness the first country in the three of the world founded on that idea it's a perfect idea the whole story of America is the battle to achieve that idea from our flawed reality if John McCain has been in that fight and all of the virtues that define his life were necessary for the thriving and the survival of the nation there is necessary for the nation as air in Sun and water or for the forests and this vile Whitehouse's attacks are not on John McCain but on the material importance of those values in the life of the nation and the degradation of those values in the constant assault on them the assault on our institutions the assault on goodness in decency in this country that's what this fight is about hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching
