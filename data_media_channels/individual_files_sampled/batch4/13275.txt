oh they love me here I the end of the day if somebody always says and stay out that's alright let me let me begin start with a personal comment about this Roy Moore scandal because I've been thinking about it all weekend and I won't get into you know too much information or anything like this but I actually believe that every male commentator who is commenting on this huge sex scandal which is now sweeping Hollywood and politics and the state houses and all this and now has hit this candidate for the special election for to replace Jeff Sessions a senator in Alabama I think that every male candidate is actually operating under the unspoken threat of feminist blackmail and the reason I think that is because I think every young man has done something that he regrets okay women have no clue they have no clue what it is like to be a young man it is like being tied to a rocket a rocket which basically wants the plant itself and every female that walks by and some men many men handle this quite well but a lot of them handle it well because of fear they're afraid of getting caught afraid of getting disease afraid of all kinds of things but they are all dealing with a power that women know nothing about women do not know it so every man who talks about this is afraid that if he goes off the feminist line that every accuser has to be believed that every man has done something bad that every little thing is somehow a tremendous crime against humanity instead of part of the complexity of work with women and being around women everyone's afraid oh my god something will come out something will you know about me will come out and I can be destroyed just like all these other people I see being destroyed around me so I want to start with a personal statement which is this I have been married now for 37 years I think it is 37 years what's that impressive it is impressive and I have been faithful to my wife I have been faithful to my wife and I think also since 37 years are basically my adult professional life I think you can go back I have worked as I worked to this very day I have worked with some of the most beautiful women on earth because I've worked in Hollywood I have worked in publishing and I've worked in the news business that's where the pretty girls go I've worked with them them all some of them were available I have I think you can interview any woman I worked with and she will tell you that I've treated over with respect I haven't chased anyone around the room I haven't you know cheese had grabbed anybody even talked you know a lot of sex in front of people even jest will say that about me just doesn't even like my shoes I may abuse you personally but I don't sexually abused B however however as a young man as I've written about this in my memoir the great good thing I was out of my mind I was sick I was twisted I was angry I was nuts and did things that I regret to this day I wake up in the you know in the middle of the night and think oh my god I've done terrible terrible things because I was this sick guy and all I can say about that guy is he's dead I know he's dead cuz I killed him with my own two hands and you know I mean like a lot of psychiatry and a lot of you know God and you know made me the man I am today and I you know a hundred times I have gone to God and said look I'm a person of goodwill why did I ever have to be that person and I think the answer is it has made me slow to judge it's why when you hear me talking about Jesus you're not hearing me say like this is a sin and that's a sanim why don't we condemn this and you did that and this I don't do that because I have looked into the heart of darkness and it was my heart I have been there I understand I understand the pain of people who do bad things I understand the twisted nough sand the fact that you're out of control and so I just put that forward to say to you that this is the point of view that I'm coming from this that I'm coming to this from and having said that and I'm not afraid of anybody saying things about because I'll tell you you know their stuff they know that I'm I wish hadn't happened that guys did I live as I live today and have lived for 37 years so having said that I believe we're now in the middle of a witch hunt okay and you say which one Harvey Weinstein you know I already know it's rape and louis c.k you know doing terrible things in front of people this is two things you have to know about a witch hunt there are always real witches some of the people get caught in witch hunts or real witches and this was true back when there were actual witch hunts the difference is that we no longer believe in witches so we no longer respect people for being afraid of witches but if we had lived back then we would have been certain there were witches it wasn't like you would have doubted it you would have been absolutely certain that some people were witches and needed to be destroyed before they destroyed you or your crops or whatever so in witch hunts there are always real witches and this is true in all times it's true now so that over the weekend USA Today put out a list of guys who have been accused and I'm reading the list and this Harvey Weinstein who did terrible things maybe include he's accused of actual rape I mean that is you know the crime under murder that we think is the worst thing and I agree it's a terrible thing to do to somebody but then there's Dustin Hoffman it's not was an 80 year old man and what's he accused of he's accused of talking dirty in front of them a woman and you know maybe inviting a woman to his hotel and it's like you know when you put those two things on the same list you're basically making the MIT list this kind of moral cloud that's a witch hunt you know guys do things they ass and women invite things and women are seductive you know and act in a transactional way sometimes who knows what happens I don't care with Dustin if Dustin Hoffman talked dirty in front of someone one of the reasons I behave the way I do is because I'm not a feminist one of the reasons I treat women with respect is because I'm not a feminist I'm a patriarch I'm an old-fashioned patriarch who believe there's a difference between men and women that men have to look out for women a little bit women don't like to talk about it but there it is you know that once once women say as feminists have been telling us now for 60 years once they say oh we're exactly the same then there's no reason when you come into a workplace that women's rules should rule instead of men's rules men talk dirty men say terrible things you know men like to make grotesque jokes the only reason they shouldn't do that is if patriarchy is in place is if it's in place that these men have to watch out for the women around them I'm a patriarch I'm old-fashioned I'm a gentleman I believe I have to watch out for people you know so that's different but feminists have no case they have no argument so in this witch-hunt we now have Roy Moore right Roy Moore is this bible-thumping guy defends the 10th the 10 commandments you know he's always talking about the evils of gay people and the evils of transgender people and blah blah blah blah it makes a big show of it and now he has been picked over Luther strange who was the guy the Trump supported Steve Bannen supported Roy Moore and he was picked to run against the Democrat and now a very red state Alabama to replace Jeff Sessions a senator now the Washington Post comes out with a report and what does the report say it says that 1979 when he was 31 to 32 Roy Moore was dating teens lots of teens some guy has said we knew he was hanging out in high schools and all this the age of consent in Alabama is 16 one of these girls who tells a very elaborate you know detailed story was at the time 14 and he touched her through her underwear took her home he was a DA and a DA and he took her home when she was involved in some case with her mother I mean it's it's a really kind of a bad story and you know it matters what the law is because we're not really in the business of judging other people's sex lives no matter what they're running for but a fourteen-year-old in my mind can't give informed consent to a 32 year old she said she didn't enjoy what was going on you know and it is completely out of line I mean it's basically it's not I'm not gonna call it child molesting but it's you know it's basically going after an underage girl and it's not right it's not right so more over the weekends you talked to Hannity and it to my mind he he basically admitted the part about dating teens so that what I'm saying about the WHA poke pieces that there's one charge in there of breaking the law charged that he was with a fourteen-year-old the charge of breaking the law the other things are about dating youngish youngest women so this is one charge to my mind on the Hannity show he basically admitted he dated teens is not cut number three this is the question answer there would it be unusual for you as a 32 year old guy to have dated a woman as young as 17 I'll be a 15 year difference or a girl 18 do you remember dating girls that young at that time not generally no I did you know just routine thing but I don't remember anything like that but you don't specifically remember having any girlfriend that was in her late teens even at that time I don't remember that and I don't remember ever dating any girl without the permission of her mother and I think in her statement she said that her mother nice lean pursed her to go out with me so he's lying basically he says I don't remember doing it but her mother encouraged her to do it and he did but he adamantly denies the 14 year old girl charge says he never knew her didn't happen he made this he made the statement to Hannity but then he made it publicly so let's listen to his public statement about this got fun isn't attacks involve a minor and they're completely false and untrue about something that happened nearly 40 years ago but more than being completely false and untrue they're very hurtful to me personally I want to make it clear to the media present and to the people president I have not provided alcohol beverages alcoholic beverages beer or anything else to a minor I have not been guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone this article is a prime example of fake news an attempt to divert attention from the true issues which affect our country okay now here's the second thing I want to say about a witch hunt in a witch hunt you and I are swept up into the emotion right it's not other people who do the witch hunt it's everybody everybody is in on the witch hunt because you have to react because people are screaming at each other and your friends are screaming and everybody's screaming and you have to feel like I have to come down have to have an opinion I have to know you know here he is the guy's denying this I was thinking even before this happened that in this atmosphere this would be an easy time to set somebody up you get a couple of women you get a couple of women who you know the guy was with and then you throw in a woman who maybe wasn't with him that's a good set up it's a good set up it doesn't mean he's he's telling the truth we know he we're pretty sure he lied about the teenage girls on Hannity so we it's hard now to trust him the girl did not come to the Washington Post The Washington Post went out and got him more keep saying well why did she wait you know 40 years to come forward that's not a good question that's actually not a good question the Washington Post doing a hit job on a candidate they don't like went out and found this girl she didn't want to talk so that's really not a good argument but but the thing is everybody is now falling into place along their political lines everybody everybody even the people who are being sanctimonious are falling into place along the political lines the political establishment which hates Roy Moore including the White House which didn't want him there saying if it's true he should step down and if not he should fight that that seems to me the kind of clearest it's the most establishment thing but it it's a clear moral stance right if he's if it's true step down if it's not true you should stand and fight it why should you be pilloried by the press of course the press they're the Witchfinder generals they're the ones in charge because this is this is the guy they hate because he's on the right and he's on the far right you know they they've come out with these statements unbelievable statements fredo what's his guise what's his name Cuomo on SIA and he is the Fredo of the Cuomo family and I'm not so fond of the Cuomo family altogether Cuomo and here's here's a little quick montage a two-person montage we put together of Cuomo and Marty's and Martha Raddatz as ABC they can't believe that anybody would wait to find out if it's true listen to this Democratic candidate had a story come out today that we found a fourteen-year-old young woman at the time now much older okay so the candidate was much younger just like in the Roy Moore story and she said well now that you got me I wouldn't told this story would you feel the same way about it that boy you know this Democratic candidate he needs to let's give him every benefit of the depth and let's see if there's any other proof other than this woman reluctantly coming forward and saying when I was 14 he touched me here he touched me there and I asked him to take me home I was very uncomfortable I wanted it to end would you be so open-minded I'm taking politics out of this I I don't know how you can because every comment that's made by people on the right is defending and putting in context of political utility the well let's see if it's true well boy the timing is suspicious these are not things that you say when you're being sensitive to the women in the case they just are not I think generally you hear you know we don't know and it was 40 years ago sort of the things that Roy Moore was saying there that if if he did that and and I don't know really how you take this further you've got four women on the record who the Washington Post sought out they didn't come to the Washington Post and and thirty others who they talked to so I don't really know what those voters are waiting for you don't do you maybe they're waiting for proof a and it's not for women it's one woman who is accusing them of illegality and if the press especially the left-wing press is gonna start to lecture us on dating young women let me show you a cover this is for People magazine I found this cover from people yeah People magazine Jerry Seinfeld look who's in love Jerry Seinfeld 39 and Shoshanna lahnstein 18 make an unlikely romance work these guys have been undermining our sexual mores for the last 60 years and now they're suddenly telling us oh we suddenly have to turn you know on this candidate because he's dating young women that's not gonna work that doesn't work that's the first thing the second thing is they're essentially especially Cuomo who is the guys as dumb as a brick Cuomo is basically saying how can you doubt us we're the press we doubt you because you lie you lie you know there was a story last week about Trump's bodyguard I think it was let me let me make sure I've got it yeah his bodyguard he was in Congress they were investigating the steel dossier the thing that said that the Russian the Trump had slept with these Russian and hookers and all the stuff and the guy said that after a business meeting before the Miss Universe pageant in 2013 he's testifying to Congress a Russian participant offered to send five women to Donald Trump's hotel room in Moscow his longtime bodyguard told Congress this week according to three sources who were present for the interview two of the sources said the bodyguard Keith Schiller viewed the offer as a joke and immediately responded we don't do that type of stuff so essentially the steal document is now like debunked by this guy right he's saying it didn't happen so GQ that which has now become a left-wing cesspit says runs a story with the headline isn't it strange how more of the steel dossier keeps checking out that's an NBC guy of NBC tweeted out you know Trump was offered Russian hookers yeah but it didn't say he turned him down they thought it was a joke he wasn't we don't do that kind of stuff so they lie I mean remember the guy from Time magazine saying the bust of Martin Luther King had been removed from the Oval Office because he didn't see it he didn't happen to see it and then they said oh it was just a mistake not a mistake these guys have been doing hit pieces on Donald Trump every word out of his mouth has been you know reconfigured to be the to give it its worst possible meaning everything is a scandal everything he does is wrong so they lie so why should anybody believe him but the bigger divide here is between the people who support Trump and the never Trump errs and that's what I will talk about in a moment but first I have to talk about something equally important if not more so which is why you are still going to the post office right I don't go to the post office you know why do I use stamps calm I use stamps that come because my wife was sick and tired of me saying go to the post office sick and tired of waiting online post office does great stuff it really does but nobody wants

Trump versus never Trump divide and Michael Knowles will join us after this but first I got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube come on over to the daily wire.com and listen to the rest of the show and while you're there subscribe and then you can watch the whole thing live so the Trumper x' and never trump errs are falling along very very predictable lines ban and steve Bannon and sean hannity they were attacking the accusers hannity is losing some sponsors over this which is you know a lot of people are saying they're gonna Keurig was one of them uh cork our coffee makers are Keurig isn't yeah so some people are saying they're gonna boycott curry because hold it Breitbart is sending reporters to Alabama to see if they can find stuff to discredit the accusers which you know I think is gonna be tough to do unless the accusers have been paid off and there's no evidence of that so far whatsoever and like I said they were hunted down on and the big one of course the one that got everybody going and this has happened to a couple times David Horowitz David Horowitz obviously long time used to be a radical leftist now he's a radical conservative longtime friend of mine David and I had a kind of a falling out over a truth revolt but we've made it up between us and he's he's a guy with a very intense guy and he sent out a tweet saying Roy Moore is probably guilty but we should vote for him anyway to keep the Senate you know Democratic especially at this very delegate time because we have such a small the Republicans have such a small lead in the Senate and the Trump errs then go absolutely insane and in my view this never Trump errs are getting a kind of sanctimonious tone that they might want to check on just a little bit I love some of them some of them of the great people and I know what they're talking about and I understand where they're coming from but they just went nuts on David you know here is max boot who is a neocon he says Roy Moore response shows that the GOP deserves to die you may have thought that Republicans had sunk as low as they could possibly go last year when they nominated for the presidency a man who was singularly unfit morally and mentally for that post but know once you start racing to the bottom you never quite stop there is always another level of degeneracy to be plumbed and this is the has been the never Trump's argument from the beginning which may have something to do with the fact that they didn't vote for a guy and he's actually doing a pretty good job Trump didn't support this guy Trump did not support Roy Moore you know he said fine in the White House it's basically said if it's true he should step down if it's not true he shouldn't which is the basic establishment point of view and very sanctimonious thing that this is the worst thing ever but I want to look at it from David Horowitz point of view for a minute because I don't think I I disagree with David I disagree with both sides in this in this argument I disagree with David but I don't think he's being a bad guy I think he has a very particular way of looking about it let's do a a mind experiment for a minute let's say that America had sunk so low that 48 of its senators were now Nazis and there were open Nazis they were saying oh boy can't wait till we get a couple more votes then we're gonna start killing them Jews you know it's gonna be terrific that that's what the Nazis are saying and the Republicans who are running against the Nazis run a guy who turns out to be a child molester would you vote for him or not that's what David is dealing with because David looks at the Democrat Party and he doesn't see the Democrat Party of his childhood he sees a group of far leftist who he thinks are endangering the American experiment and he says it's worth you know checking your morals at the door to stop them and that's what a lot of people said about Donald Trump I personally voted for Donald from because I thought the turn ative was generally Hillary Clinton would generally mean the end of the American experiment I didn't believe that that would be stopped by her by a Republican majority I still don't believe it it was a binary choice I made a choice it was difficult to me it was it was unpleasant to make but not difficult it seemed like an easy choice to make so that's what Horowitz is saying and I have some sympathy with that I think he's David is more radical than I am but that's what he sees and so he's not speaking out of some amoral cesspit of us a soul or anything like that he's saying we're in a radical situation radical mean measures have to be taken so here's where I come down and here's what I think we can say without any compromise at all one Roy Moore is an utter and complete fraud I mean I don't say that because of what he may have done in the past I say that because of what he is doing now okay this is a guy who has hammered that Bible and hammered the Ten Commandments and made a big big fuss about it if he was dating high school girls that may not be illegal it may not be my part to judge but it's pretty creepy and then what I would like to hear him say is you know look a Christian man is not a perfect man it by any means a Christian man is not a sinless man a Christian him and is dedicated to the truth he worships the truth the guy said I am the truth that is who we worship if he he was lying to Hannity he didn't say he never even thought to say yes I did sinful things I did stupid things I did terrible things I'm not that man I've been saved by God I'm and turned around he didn't even think to say it he didn't even it didn't even enter his mind all he did was lie and you know he went right there so whether he slept with his fourteen-year-old girl not this guy is a total phony okay that is one thing - Steve Bannon has a lot to answer for okay and i'm not a steve Bannon hater or anything like that i always got along with steve when he was a Hollywood guy he's never said a bad word to me but but he came out and said we are having a civil war against the GOP and Mitch McConnell said that's not the way we do this because you guys are gonna lose because it's just like the Tea Party and Steve Bannon went out and he supported Roy Moore and now they're stuck with a candidate who could lose this seat because of that and that was your job that's the job if you're the Tea Party or if you're Steve the banning party your job is to vet these guys so you don't go against the establishment with a guy can't win you know I mean this is something that he has to answer for and I think he needs to step forward and talk about this because you know if your wishes or you got a win you got you know you're gonna kill the king you gotta kill the king third Bill Clinton did a great disservice to this country and the Democrats have not yet addressed it and certain Democrats and certain fo-fo conservative like David Brooks are coming out and saying this back when Bill Clinton was having an affair with a young woman in the Oval Office and cheating on his wife the feminists rushed to his defense and the left rushed to his defense the most famous one was the feminist journalist Nina Burleigh who said I would be happy to give him oral sex just to thank him for keeping abortion legal I think American women should be lining up with their presidential kneepads to show their gratitude for keeping the theocracy off our backs so the long-ago the democratic party sold out saying the saying the Republicans are so bad that it's worth you know accepting any kind of behavior to get our policies in place we are not arguing about whether the Democrats are scum we're arguing about whether the Republicans should sink to the level of the Democrats that's what we're arguing about Chris Hayes was on MSNBC far-left commentator he said he put out a tweet as gross and cynical and hypocritical as the writes what about Bill Clinton stuff is it's also true that Democrats in the center-left are overdue for a real reckoning with the allegations against him which include a charge of rape he was hammered the left came out in how I was watching to some of my left-wing friends were on the Twitter feed yelling at him why do we have to talk about Bill Clinton why do we have to talk about Bill Clinton because you guys put the right in this situation the right is reacting to you and that doesn't make them right it doesn't make them right to sink to your level but they are sinking to your level and every single person who defended Bill Clinton who is now sitting around and harping against the right including clowns like Chris Cuomo and Martha Raddatz every single one of them is answerable for this that brought us to this situation so what do I think we should do you know I'm not as radical as David Horowitz you know I'm not as radical as David Horowitz I don't think that the the left is evil but I do think they have moved so far left that I do believe they are endangering all rights to free speech our rights to guns our rights to defend ourselves a whole concept there there this attacking our whole concept of bottom-up government what I would like to see happen where I would actually like to see happen is I'd like to see Roy Moore win this so we don't lose the seat and then I think the Senate should kick him the hell out I think you know I think it would be great if he won the seat I don't think he's going to I think he's gonna lose now because of this but I think it would be great if Roy Moore won the seat and then the Senate like grown-ups threw him out for what he did then we'd have to have another election and maybe we'll put up Luther strange and maybe he'll win maybe we'll have the election that we should have had I that's not a great solution I know it's not a great solution we should be able to kick guys out when they are shown to be complete frauds like this we should be able to just get rid of them but I do believe that the left has gone so far left that they've become a danger to the American experiment and it might be worth shelving that for a moment to make sure they don't get in and then we get rid of the sky because I don't think this guy's fit to serve in the Senate I really don't and so I think it would be night I think basically I think the Republicans should turnout and elect them and then I think Mitch McConnell should boot him into the net into next week speaking of booting people into next week let's bring on Michael Knowles is right there he is these people unfit to serve in the Senate and you know a man who is I don't think there's been one accusation against you yet I am as shocked as anybody obviously they're going to marshals have been filing a few but we hushed those down here at the Daily wire and I know as the the heartthrob star of another Kingdom I know that the women are just throwing themselves all over us they are they the the virtual women are virtually throwing themselves at me it's really virtually very flat or high up I love those virtual women they're so much easier to deal with well that is we're only about five years away from the sex robots in the end of civilization so really we're just seeing into the future for profits so your job was to go out and look at I mean what struck me about this as I was thinking about it is everybody's acting like this is some amazing thing that's happened but this is all through American history sex scandals have been basically standard operating procedure this is true very often we want to think you hear this all the time about Trump they say this has never happened before we've never had a person this awful and uncouth in office that isn't true they said it even with Clinton I guess we've never seen anything like this before it turns out that sex scandals are a pretty American institution they've been around for a long time I do I love this country for some reason that's right I will freely admit that they occur on both sides of the aisle they've occurred in many parties that no longer exist you know the country was founded by pilgrims up north and by vicious criminals in Jamestown there is this moralizing aspect to America and also this scoundrel aspect to America so the first one is one of my favorite founding fathers Alexander Hamilton a Hamilton launched the nation's first official Skaggs sex scandal in 1791 when he decided to calanis fan named James Callender so he starts an affair with this guy's wife and it goes unnoticed for a little while what he doesn't realize is the husband knows this and extorts him for a thousand dollars a thousand dollars right now right now it's quite expensive you know a thousand dollars in 1791 was very expensive he paid off the money unfortunately six years later for Hamilton it came out they linked him to a financial scandal so to get out of that Hamilton admitted it it hurt his career but whatever you know it lasted for a little while John Adams said of Alexander Hamilton quote that bastard brat of a Scottish peddler his ambition his restlessness and all his grandiose schemes come I'm convinced from a super abundance of secretions which he couldn't find enough whores to absorb the second President of the United States talking about the first secretary of the Treasury then Thomas Jefferson obviously okay I had this affair with his slave Sally Hemings its misrepresented I think by the statue top lers because Sally Hemings was the half-sister of his dead wife so she looked a lot like the wife and there was more to the story than just Jefferson walking on saying eenie meenie miney moe all right you're coming with me but again you know third price in the United States then this guy is a particular favorite of mine James Henry Hammond again this is in the mid early to mid 19th century James Henry Hammond from the nullifier party from South Carolina of course he had a gay relationship with a college friend then he had a little dalliance with two of his teenage nieces when this became a public knowledge in 1843 he was forced to withdraw from his race from his next bid in 1846 he wasn't forced to resign he was just forced to withdraw from his next bid and then he became a senator again less than two terms later forgiving of course you know in the nieces had reached the age of maturity of that point so all was forgiven in South Carolina then there's James Buchanan James Buchanan our bachelor president he had a good pal named William Rufus King Andrew Jackson a pair apparently referred to King as Miss Nancy and aunt fancy they were seen day they lived together for 10 years when this guy moved away to Europe Buchanan was inconsolable and wrote about how he was gonna go looking to woo other men this was you know quite a long time ago long before the gay pride movement said it reached America Grover Cleveland fathered a bastard child now when this became apparent Grover Cleveland's opponents which come to his rallies and shout mama where's my Paul but then when he won election to the White House the the chant was responded to with gone to the White House ha ha ha they're right Donald Trump has brought this country down oh wait he wasn't alive is right yeah this is in 1884 slightly before mr. Trump my favorite I think might be other than the nullifier party guy is Senator David Walsh Senator David Walsh Democrat from Massachusetts was accused of visiting a gay Nazi brothel a gay Nazi brothel that's not when that happened yeah it's frowned upon in American society but that's fine he was he was a senator we have the Supreme Court Justice William O Douglas he allegedly married three times he pursued other women while married to his third wife and molested flight attendants he did yeah I was a Supreme Court justice so them what we consider the most dignified branch of the government he was out there you know getting a little fresh you know the flight attendant we don't know what they're wearing under those robes that is true if we don't know if they're wearing anything under those now the modern sex scandal was brought into American politics by congressman Wilbur Mills Wilbur Mills in 1974 was found drunk with a beat-up stripper named fan fanny Fox he was re-elected anyway but he was resigned after he gave a drunk press conference from her strip club dressing he was obviously Fred Richmond Democrat from New York solicited sex from a 16 year old boy but those charges were dropped after he submitted to counseling and this brings up another trend in American sexual debauched history which is as long as you go to counseling it doesn't matter you can do whatever you want so congressman Robert Bauman was charged with soliciting sex from a 16 year old male prostitute so what did he do he went to treatment for alcoholism all charges were dropped everything is fine more recently we did have my former Governor Eliot Spitzer he spent $80,000 on high-priced hookers while he was Attorney General and prosecuting them and he allegedly wore black socks and a New York Yankees cap well he did it you know I have to admit to a certain boyish curiosity I would like to know what these women did that was worth that kind of money that a certain number of apps yeah Norma Connell says they were really only like four things you can do I think you invent the fifth but it's really just like three and two so I God knows what he did but he certainly did a lot of it and then recently we've gotten to Anthony Weiner who who had a digital sex game it was a virtual sex camp it's like my virtual heartthrob enos from another Kingdom and so really if you're looking at the trend of American history it seems that these sex scandals are getting quite a lot more holes then then they used to be and ROI more now is is the object of the moralizing and of his own sex scandal involving underage girls but of course the Democrats have this difficult thing to overcome which is we ought to believe every accuser and we have to take all of these seriously and also 11 months ago we supported a woman who pressured her husband's rape victims to keep quiet they really are stuck and to watch them lecture I mean because really what the nevertrump errs are saying what they've been saying to me all this time is we are becoming as bad as the Democrats that's their big complaint that right not that we're becoming worse but simply that we're sinking to their level and a lot of the Trump supporters are saying yeah we have to sink to their level to win I mean that's basically the argument that we're in and you know the precursor to the moderate Republican Party the Federalist Party at the outset of our country was founded by a guy who had an abundance of secretions and cuckold and some other poor guys so I don't know yes we're not as bad as the Democrats but you know these things a band float on that no question about it an excellent report you're doing the conversation tomorrow I'm doing the conversation I've been I've been reading up obviously and all this important history there any questions yeah but I'll be on on the firing line in the conversation so fine e questions 2 p.m. Pacific and anybody can watch it on the daily web wire website or the Facebook page and the YouTube channel but but they have to pony up and subscribe in order to ask you questions and I think a lot of good questions could be asked of you like where were you Thursday at and the while you're subscribing I think people also orders subscribe to another Kingdom absolutely it's the last role I'm ever gonna have in Hollywood and so I really recommend it we've got a bet a gazillion reviews already so yeah while you're at it kill two birds with one stone absolutely really good good performance stop it you're gonna make me blush I'm gonna get out of here it is a really fun story and I think some of the reviews at least like 5% of them might be genuine they're not just Russian robots so yeah people are enjoying the story it's a really fun tale it's hard to know which is crazier fantasy Lane under Hollyweird but only one way to find out is to listen to the story if this keeps up you'll be able to have people watch you shower Michael knows the Michael Moore show is coming up next tune in it's good to see how Michael Itachi's ooh alright you know you don't want to play for just a second Saturday Night Live because I keep talking about the fact that the Democrats are falling apart they actually did it a smart routine on the Democrats on how out of touch and old they are and I think it's it's that's so shocking that it's actually worth playing a small cut of those SNL team basically playing the incredibly old and out of touch Democrats and we learned our lesson from the last election we can't just appeal to coastal elites we need mouth readers from Wisconsin and window liquors from Ohio as well and we know that what Americans really care about is jobs jobs like smuggling immigrants across the border and converting Confederate monuments into statues of prominent lesbian poet they're gonna listen to people if they don't say what's politically correct like these comics out there who think it's okay to make jokes about concentration camps that guy should rotten the hell the dams are back and we won't stop now because we need another path for our country another vision for America another chance for me Hillary Rodham Clinton just one more chance maybe one more chance after that she was dead it's so shocking disease um take on the other side that it's a just the shock alone is funny all right let's do our crappy culture this time we have two absurd pieces of music for our crappy culture because we're taking a visit to the op-ed page of the New York Times or as we call it knucklehead row so an op-ed in the New York Times by echo in Janka black guys a professor at the Benjamin and Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University and the reason I mentioned that he's a black guy is is op IDI is called can my children be friends with white people and his answer is no for African Americans I swear that's what he says race has become proxy not just for politics but also for decency white faces are swept together ominous anxiety behind every chance encounter at the airport are smiling white cashier who I hate those smiling white cashiers are the worst if they are not clearly allies they will seem unsafe to me so that's his thing you can be friends with white people if if they support your politics all right he says among my dearest friends because his wife is a census by ethnic he calls her he says my by ethnic white is my most trusted friend she understands she is seen as a white woman even though her brother and father or not among my dearest friends the wedding party and children's godparents variety many are white but but these are the friends who have marched in protest rushed to airports to protest the president's travel ban people who have shared the risks required by strength and decency you know I can't respond to this because we're certain things we're not allowed to say that's really I don't we have a two-word response to this and the second word is you but here's the thing this points out the fact that the you know people talk about why is the argument we're having so intense so angry and the reason is we're having two separate arguments we on the right are talking about policies that we think will help everybody okay we're talking about policies which we are not making any just you know any distinguishing we're not distinguishing identities we're not distinguishing women from men we're not just ringing in blacks turn white we are distinguishing women from men in the sense that I talked about at the beginning that they're different and therefore there may be some difference in treatment well but in terms of policy we're talking about things that we hope will help everybody we hope it'll bring peace to confront radical Islam we hope it'll bring more safety to close the border we hope it'll help you know the economy to cut down on our extraordinarily high corporate tax rate all those things are what we're talking about we're talking about policies they are talking about identity all the time and what they don't like about Donald Trump is the some of his supporters are talking back in the same language here is Van Jones talking about Roy Moore the left-wing good commentator Van Jones talking about Roy Moore and talking about what he sees on the right that's so shocking to him we haven't mentioned Steve Bannon in this but this is Bandhan ism on trial Bannon is trying to create this sense of an aggrieved identity group frankly a white aggrieved identity group that's under seized by everyone and this is that in its worse form so you're not supposed to vote as a father you're not supposed to vote as a brother you're not supposed to vote as a as a woman you're supposed to vote as a member of this identity group against the world and if that works that is very very bad for Republican Party it's very very bad for the country hold their whole policy that's everything vote as your group and what Van Jones is complaining about is not that it's happening he's complaining about the fact that the right is doing it the right way what is your argument if you tell people to vote as black people if you tell people your children can't play with white people you know if you tell people that women have a right to vote as women why can't men vote as men well I can't white people vote as white people the entire argument is wrong and I reject their argument and I accept the right obviously I'm a right-winger I believe that we should have pop we should talk about policies only policies they should outlaw obviously I'm being facetious but they should not allow in political discussions words like racist sexist they don't matter they don't matter all that matters is policy and whether it works I know that's more wonky it's not as exciting it doesn't make as much good TV but it really is what we should be talking about and that is why why our culture our political culture has become so crappy I got to go tomorrow we have Cassie J I'm really excited about this she made this documentary the red pill which started out being about she started out being against basically the men's movement and then she sort of said wait a minute these people have had a point she took the red pill and stopped being a feminist or at least has turned away from that kind of feminism that we despise I'm Andrew Klavan this is the Andrew Clavin show be there for that tomorrow Oh
