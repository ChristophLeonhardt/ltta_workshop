AND THEY WILL ANNOUNCE THAT
SOON.
>> Julie: MORE COMING.
ALL RIGHT.
RICH EDSON, THANK YOU.
>> Bill: I WANT TO BRING IN
SENATOR TIM SCOTT.
REPUBLICAN FROM SOUTH CAROLINA.
GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK ON THE
PROGRAM.
TO ME IT STRIKES AS MORE PUBLIC
NEGOTIATIONS.
HOW DO YOU REACT TO THAT WORD
FROM PYONGYANG?
>> I AGREE WITH YOU 100%.
THE REALITY IS SIMPLE.
THAT THE LAST 30 YEARS PLUS
NORTH KOREA HAS BEEN TRYING TO
FIND A WAY TO DECEIVE THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE REST OF
THE WORLD INTO ASSUMING THEY
WILL GIVE UP THEIR NUCLEAR
WEAPONS, NUCLEAR PROGRAM IF WE
DO FILL IN THE BLANK.
THE REALITY OF IT IS THE BULLY
FROM NORTH KOREA FINALLY MET A
PRESIDENT HE COULDN'T DECEIVE.
IT'S WHY HE IS COMING TO THE
TABLE.
THE PRESIDENT HAS NEGOTIATED
THE TERMS OF COMING TOGETHER
AND APPLYING MORE SANCTIONS AND
ISOLATING NORTH KOREA WE FIND
THEM COMING CLOSER TO THE TABLE
BUT WE SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS IN
OUR OPTIMISM.
WE CAN'T SEND A SIGNAL WE'RE
HAPPY THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER
COMING TO THE TABLE.
HE NEEDS TO SIT DOWN, HAVE A
CONVERSATION AND SHOW US
DISCERNIBLE STEPS TAKEN TO
DENUCLEARIZE THE DMZ.
WITHOUT THAT CONTINUE TO APPLY
THE PRESSURE AND INCREASE
SANCTIONS AGAINST THE NORTH
KOREAN REGIME.
>> Bill: YOU COULD BE SPOT ON.
DO YOU THINK MAC THORNBERRY WAS
RIGHT SAYING THAT MAYBE KIM
JONG-UN HAS WHAT HE NEEDS IN
TERMS OF A IN NUCLEAR DEVELOPED
PROGRAM.
>> THEY'VE MADE A LOT OF
ADVANCEMENTS SINCE THEY STARTED
PLAYING GAMES IN THE EARLY 90s
WITH PRESIDENTS SAYING THEY
WOULD STEP AWAY FROM THE
PROGRAM.
BUYING MORE TIME TO DO MORE
DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH AND
FRANKLY THEY'VE DONE A GOOD JOB
AT KEEPING US AT BAY.
THE GOOD NEWS IS WE'RE FINALLY
PUSHING THEM THROUGH THE TABLE
THROUGH ISOLATION AND ECONOMIC
SANCTIONS.
IF WE ALL WANT WORLD PEACE THE
BEST WAY TO GET THERE IS APPLY
THE KIND OF PRESSURE THAT
REQUIRES THE NORTH KOREAN
REGIME TO BRING BACK THE
CURTAINS AND LET US WATCH
CLOSELY WHAT THEY DO NEXT.
LET US NOT LISTEN TO THE WORDS
OF THE REGIME, LET US WATCH THE
ACTIONS.
>> Bill: ONE MORE QUESTION ON
THIS AND I THINK YOU'RE EXACTLY
RIGHT.
I THINK THE SANCTIONS WORKED
AND THE CHINESE PRESSURE HAS
WORKED AND THE MILITARY
PRESSURE ON BEHALF OF THE
PRESIDENT AND JAMES MATTIS HAVE
WORKED SO FAR AND WHAT'S ALL
DRIVING THIS.
DO YOU THINK THIS PRESIDENT
WOULD SACRIFICE SOME OF THE
13,000 U.S. TROOPS SERVING IN
SOUTH KOREA TO DRAW DOWN THAT
NUMBER IN ORDER TO POSSIBLY
MAKE A DEAL IN THE END?
>> I REALLY DON'T THINK SO.
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN
PRETTY CLEAR ON THEIR
OPPOSITION TO REMOVING OUR
TROOPS.
THAT DOES NOT MAKE THE WORLD
SAFER.
IT DOES NOT MAKE THE KOREAN
PENINSULA SAFER, IT CREATES
MORE VOLATILITY AND REDUCES THE
AMOUNT OF SECURITY WHICH I
THINK EMBOLDENS THE NORTH
KOREAN REGIME.
IF PART OF THE NEGOTIATIONS IS
A REQUIREMENT THAT WE REMOVE
OUR TROOPS, THAT IS BAD NEWS
FOR SOUTH KOREA AND EVEN WORSE
NEWS FOR OUR COUNTRY AND THE
WORLD.
COMING UP IN SIX MONTHS AND I'M
CERTAIN YOU'RE WELL AWARE.
>> I'VE HEARD OF IT.
>> Bill: THE HILL HAS A
HEADLINE TODAY.
SHOW IT FIRST.
I WANT TO POINT THIS OUT.
DEMS FACE PRESSURE TO FOCUS ON
ECONOMY, NOT TRUMP.
SOMETHING A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL
BE HEARING NOW VERY SOON.
THIS TWEET FROM THE
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF LAST HOUR ON
SCREEN.
IS THIS PHONY WITCH HUNT GOING
TO GO ON EVEN LONGER SO IT
WRONGFULLY IMPACTS THE MID-TERM
ELECTIONS WHICH IS WHAT THE
DEMOCRATS ALWAYS INTENDED?
REPUBLICANS BETTER GET TOUGH
AND SMART BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
WHAT ABOUT THE LAST PART OF
THAT.
ARE REPUBLICANS TOUGH AND SMART
AS HE SUGGESTS?
>> I THINK WE ARE DEFINITELY AS
A PARTY A VERY TOUGH PARTY AND
WE ARE CERTAINLY SMART.
THE QUESTION IS ARE WE GOOD AT
MARKETING.
THAT QUESTION NEEDS TO BE
ANSWERED BY PROOFING TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT THE
SUCCESSES WE HAVE SEEN FROM A
POLICY PERCENTECTIVE WE OUGHT
TO HIGHLIGHT THAT.
WE CAN'T ALLOW FAKE NEWS TO
CREATE THIS BARRAGE THAT
REQUIRES US TO RESPOND TO EVERY
SINGLE THING THAT COMES OUT OF
THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA MACHINE.
WE NEED TO BE FOCUSING ON THE
FACT THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME
SINCE 2000 WE HAVE UNEMPLOYMENT
RATES UNDER 4%.
THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN
RECORDED HISTORY THAT
AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT
IS AT 6.6%.
WE'VE HAD THE LARGEST EXPANSION
IN OUR ECONOMY THAT WE CAN
REMEMBER IN THE LAST CENTURY.
THE FACTS ARE VERY CLEAR.
IF WE DON'T MARKET TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE THE SUCCESS,
THE POLICY SUCCESS OF THIS
ADMINISTRATION, WE PUT IN PERIL
AND JEOPARDIZE THE SUCCESS THAT
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED US TO
HAVE IN NOVEMBER TO CONTINUE
THIS ECONOMIC RECOVERY THAT
REQUIRES GOOD, CONSERVATIVE
POLICIES TO UNDERGIRD THE NEXT
WAVE OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE
AVERAGE PERSON WORKING PAYCHECK
TO PAYCHECK.
>> Bill: THERE WILL BE A LOT OF
TALK OF THIS IN THE COMING
