I'm J Herman on the epic lead scientist for the discovery mission on July 6th 2015 we released the spectacular image of Earth taken by NASA's epic camera now we assembled more than 3000 images captured by epic into a time-lapse sequence that shows a year in the life of our planet epic is an earth science instrument aboard the discover satellite which launched in February 2015 the spacecraft always remains between the Sun and the earth approximately 1 million miles away at a special gravitational balance point known as lagrangian from this view epic sees the sunrise in the west and the sunset in the east at least 13 times a day the haze seen around the edges is due to scattering of light by molecules in the atmosphere scattering is also what makes the sky appear blue during the day and red at sunset the colors shown are a best estimate of what a human sitting at the location of epic would see epic takes at least one set of images about every two hours the camera records each set in 10 different wavelengths at least three separate wavelengths red green and blue are combined to produce this color view in March a moon passed between the Earth and the Sun causing a total solar eclipse during the Eclipse moon cast its shadow over a portion of the planet if we slow the video down we can see the moon shadow make an appearance right about now although the view from epic is only once every two hours we're able to track features like a motion of clouds around two-thirds of the earth is covered by clouds clouds reflect light from the Sun helping to keep the planet cool they also trap heat rising from the surface keeping the planet warm changes in cloud cover affect the heat balance and how warm the earth becomes which is one of the reasons why we study them the early images of the entire sunlit side of the earth provided by epic will be used to study the daily variations of features over the entire globe helping us to better understand and protect our home planet you
