2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,529
high school we want to retreat right

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:06,450
before we graduated and you're asked to

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,260
write a letter to ourselves five years

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,980
in the future and that happened row 17

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,100
and today<font color="#CCCCCC"> employee to and that letter</font>

7

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,189

9
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">about 17 year old me have a say about</font>

10
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:28,769
life about to<font color="#E5E5E5"> graduate high school and</font>

11

12
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,488
Marquette I got a new northwestern

13
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:34,380
McAllister<font color="#CCCCCC"> too but I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to my cut I</font>

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,420
hope that's not a mistake Marquette was

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,760
an excellent choice seventeen-year-old

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,520
me you had an awesome time there and you

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,340
miss it now that you are graduated with

18
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,780
Luke right now are you still with him

19
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,620
yes we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I'm married I have some</font>

20
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,059
people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope you still in touch</font>

21
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,760
with that I'm no longer in touch with

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,420
and 17 year old knee tells now me to get

23
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,520
in touch with them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what I'm</font>

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,809
not going to get in touch<font color="#E5E5E5"> with them</font>

25
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:03,260
thing that you learn when you get older

26
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,630
that sometimes your friends and your

27
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,700
relationships change and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

28
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,710
bad thing because people change and

29
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,049
sometimes we go apart for good reasons

30
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:14,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">because you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just not right for each</font>

31
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:16,399
other slides anymore I have blue hair

32
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:18,619
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really cool I hope</font>

33
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:20,720
you still look different in some way

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,149
because you are so that was a big thing

35
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:26,180
I was into in high school like the way

36
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,820
that I dressed and had my hair and did

37
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,700
my makeup I was at this very emo kid<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

38
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,070
I got an older<font color="#CCCCCC"> and started just looking</font>

39
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:38,060
more like a general<font color="#E5E5E5"> person i have had</font>

40
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,310
moments where<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm like nobody can tell</font>

41
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,759
by looking at me what I like to do or

42
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,090
what kind of music I listen to hey it's

43
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,479
cool people are complex and it's cool if

44
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,850
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't tell everything about them by</font>

45
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,090
what colors are here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh here is where</font>

46
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,369
I sound like a total jerk remember how

47
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:01,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">you learn about existentialism that</font>

48
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:03,679
struggle is what makes you it teaches

49
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:05,509
you and strengthen see you face it

50
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:07,729
head-on as much as I thought I was

51
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:09,440
really cool by pretending to understand

52
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,599
existentialism that's still a good

53
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,420
message a struggle makes you who you are

54
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,840
and as weird and as difficult as the

55
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,260
years coming out of and going into

56
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">college are I've learned a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot from them</font>

57
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,940
and give it a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> some things I think 17</font>

58
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,030
year old me wrong is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you always</font>

59
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,500
have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends with the same people</font>

60
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,170
this weird idea that when you get older

61
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,010
your soul<font color="#CCCCCC"> advised and you become this</font>

62
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,620
miserable desperate boring adult to the

63
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">sweater I'm telling myself this has</font>

64
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">always been your dream do it now if</font>

65
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're not doing it already and that is</font>

66
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,930
point but dreams change when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wrote</font>

67
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,519
this letter I knew nothing about

68
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:55,640
videography and now it is biggest

69
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,010
passion that I have and sometimes I

70
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,140
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guitar but it's not my life's</font>

71
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,890
dream anymore to be a rock star but<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

72
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,989
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a grasp</font>

73
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:09,379
on at 17 years old is how much things

74
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:12,560
change and how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a cool thing that</font>

75
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,560
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole letter I was basically</font>

76
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to shake my idea of my boring</font>

77
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,920
pathetic 22 year old self back and being

78
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,920
cool but what I didn't know is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

79
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,079
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm actually way cooler now than I</font>

80
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,969
ever was in high school and that's

81
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:31,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">precisely because I have changed so much</font>

82
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,680
in the comments below tell me what you

83
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,029
