SUMMIT SUMMI SUMMIT IS ON OR OFF. Sean: AND JOINING US A FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR DANIEL HOFFMAN IS WITH US. I LOVE THE WAY THE PRESIDENT STATES IT. MISSILES NOT FIRED OVER JAPAN, GUAM'S NOT IN JEOPARDY, THE KOREAN PENINSULA IS MORE SAFE AND HOSTAGES RELEASED, TRUMP PULLS OUT THEY BEG, NO, NO, NO, PLEASE, PLEASE. NO DOWN SIDE AND WE DIDN'T PAY CASH THIS TIME, DID WE? IT'S QUITE A CONTRAST FROM WHAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION GAVE UP TO GET BERGDAHL BACK FROM SOME BAD TERRORISTS. WHAT I'D HIGHLIGHT IN THE MEETING BETWEEN SECRETARY POMPEO AND THE FEWER-STAR GENERAL FORMER HEAD OF MILITARY INTELLIGENCE AND REFLECTS THE SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH KIM JONG-UN IS APPROACHING THE SUMMIT. AND KIM JONG-UN HAS BEEN TARGETED FOR RESPONSIBLE FOR KILLING 46 SOUTH KOREAN SAILORS IN 2010 BUT THIS IS THE HAND WE'RE DEALT WITH AND PART OF THE CHALLENGE OF DEALING WITH A HERMIT KINGDOM AND THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT WILL HAVE TO TAKE PLACE WITH UNSAVORY CHARACTERS. Sean: I LOVE THE FACT THAT ALL THESE BIG DEVELOPMENTS HAVE HAPPENED. THE PRESIDENT HAS GIVEN UP NOTHING. I THINK THE FACT THAT THE MEDIA DOESN'T UNDERSTAND, THIS IS THE ART OF THE DEAL. THIS IS HOW YOU NEGOTIATE. MAYBE IT HAPPENS ON THE 12th. MAYBE IT DOESN'T. MAYBE IT TAKES ONE MEETING, TWO MEETINGS, PLEA MEETINGS, PLE MEETINGS, THE MEETINGS, THRE MEETINGS, THREE MEETINGS, THREE M MEETINGS, THREE MAY MEETINGS, THREE MAYBE MEETINGS, THREE MAYBE M MEETINGS, THREE MAYBE MOR MEETINGS, THREE MAYBE MORE. IT'S WORTH IT FOR NOT ON THE COUNTRY BUT WORLD. AND SO MUCH PROGRESS I THINK KRISTIN IS RIGHT, WE DIDN'T ANTICIPATES SIX MONTHS AGO. I THINK NORTH KOREA TRIED TO PRACTICE THE ART OF BRINKMANSHIP AND THE PRESIDENT WALKED AWAY AND INJURY KOREA CAME BACK WITH A BELLICOSE MESSAGE INDICATING THEY WERE SERIOUS IN TALKING TO US. IT WILL BE AN EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLEX SERIES OF NEGOTIATIONS. RUSSIA IS ALREADY INTERFERING WITH TALK OF RATCHETING DOWN THE SANCTIONS WHICH IS NOT HELPFUL BUT I THINK WE'RE PLAYING OUR HAND AS AS WELL AS WE POSSIBLY COULD. I WOULDN'T EXPECT IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION BUT WE'RE SHOWING THE NORTH KOREANS WE MEAN BUSINESS AND THE PATTERN WE FOLLOW SHOWING STRENGTH TO NORTH KOREA CLEARLY HAS BEEN MORE EFFECTIVE THAN WHAT WE'VE SEEN FROM THE PAST TWO DECADES. Sean: AND THE PRESIDENT I THINK RIGHTLY SO MANAGING EXPECTATIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT THE SHOULD EXPECT. IF IT HAPPENS, OR DOESN'T MAPPEN. HAPPEN THE BALL WILL BE IN THEIR COURT AND IT WILL BE ABOUT
