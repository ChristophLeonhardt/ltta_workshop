I know it sound like a broken record but everyday something around this Trump Russia collusion probe just smells worse now from Fox News let me get a headline documents suggest possible coordination between CIA FBI Obama White House and dem officials early in Trump Russia probe according to investigators now that looks like collusion to me and it looks like collusion and weaponization of our intelligence community and federal law enforcement community against a particular political candidate a candidate wasn't Hillary Clinton here to make sense of this with me is former CIA station chief my good friend Scott you linger Scott I read this and a couple of names jump out at me and the first thing that jumped out at me and I said I have to call Scott is of course John Brennan again John Brennan it seems to keep coming back that Andrew McCabe and John Brennan Andrew McCabe and John Brennan why would the C CIA even be involved in a domestic potentially domestic law enforcement matter like this should they even be right that's a good question since the early seventies you know this has been a definite no-no for the CIA and they're not supposed to take they're not supposed to have any stake in local area or a domestic espionage as long as there isn't a foreigner involved and see that is that that is why the entire scandal started so to speak or that they were using carter page because he had he was basically had some kind of relationship with the russians they used that as a backdoor to target americans because see they they are allowed to track russians or people you know technically if i don't want to if i want to track you john and i don't and i'm the CIA and i cant do it legally well I'll find some foreign contact you have contact with and backdoor it that way so this show is that Brennan who started out remember it was CIA but then he was in the National Security Council and I've been totally in the tank for Obama since day one and we all know it and now it's it's being seen more and more I mean I want to get it I want to get the Brennan in a moment Scott was I know you have but let me read you something from this article that seems very troubling to me and seems to seems to support and confirm what you say it says quote the investigators say the information provided to Fox News quote strongly end quote suggests coordination between former President Barack Obama's chief of staff Denis McDonough then them Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid and CIA director John Brennan which would hey that would that would contradict all of the assertions that Barack Obama stayed out of this I mean this was right what the President of the United States directly in the middle of this thing that's right and even some of the texts between uh between uh oh hey Jeff the FBI you write the FBI folks involved the some of their we're very strange like I looked at him and they said like for instance they were talking about foi a which is the Freedom of Information Act so that they're basically figuring out ways to do to like convene these meetings etc to not create paperwork which would then be available from a Freedom of Information Act request we try to circumvent spire and for our complaint right they want to keep it as secret as possible and and they're in there they're texting about it so uh you know exactly this is just believe me I cannot emphasize enough this is just really bad stuff I mean this is the kind of stuff that like my heart sinks when I read it because this now we are reduced to the level of some penny-ante you know on third world country you know I want to keep bringing you this terribly important content every day so hope you did keep doing that by subscribing to our premium service www.mediaed.org this
