SIX MONTHS OF PREPARATIONS, $400,000 SPENT TO RETROFIT THE CONSULATE BUILDING. HERE WE GO WITH THE PRESIDENT. President Trump: TODAY WE OFFICIALLY OPEN THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. CONGRATULATIONS. IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING. ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER DECLARING STATEHOOD IN 1948, ISRAEL DESIGNATED THE CITY OF JERUSALEM AS ITS CAPITAL. THE CAPITAL, THE JEWISH PEOPLE ESTABLISHED IN ANCIENT TIMES. SO IMPORTANT. TODAY JERUSALEM IS THE SEAT OF ISRAEL'S GOVERNMENT. IT IS THE HOME OF THE ISRAELI LEGISLATURE AND THE ISRAELI SUPREME COURT AND ISRAEL'S PRIME MINISTER AND PRESIDENT. ISRAEL IS A SOVEREIGN NATION WITH THE RIGHTS LIKE EVERY OTHER SOVEREIGN NATION TO DETERMINE ITS OWN CAPITAL. YET FOR MANY YEARS WE FAILED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE OBVIOUS, THE PLAIN REALITY THAT ISRAEL'S CAPITAL IS JERUSALEM. ON DECEMBER 6, 2017 AT MY DIRECTION, THE UNITED STATES FINALLY AND OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED JERUSALEM AS THE TRUE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL. TODAY WE FOLLOW THROUGH ON THIS RECOGNITION AND OPEN OUR EMBASSY IN THE HISTORIC AND SACRED LAND OF JERUSALEM AND WE'RE OPENING IT MANY, MANY YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. AS I SAID IN DECEMBER, OUR GREATEST HOPE IS FOR PEACE. THE UNITED STATES REMAINS FULLY COMMITTED TO FACILITATING A LASTING PEACE AGREEMENT AND WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE STATUS QUO AT JERUSALEM'S HOLY SITES INCLUDING AT THE TEMPLE MOUND. THIS CITY AND THIS ENTIRE NATION IS A TESTAMENT TO THE UNBREAKABLE SPIRIT OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE, THE UNITED STATES WILL ALWAYS BE A GREAT FRIEND OF ISRAEL AND A PARTNER IN THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM AND PEACE. WE WISH AMBASSADOR FRIEDMAN GOOD LUCK AS HE TAKES UP HIS OFFICE IN THIS BEAUTIFUL JERUSALEM EMBASSY. AND WE EXTEND A HAND IN FRIENDSHIP TO ISRAEL, THE PALESTINIANS, AND TO ALL OF THEIR NEIGHBORS. MAY THERE BE PEACE. MAY GOD BLESS THIS EMBASSY. MAY GOD BLESS ALL WHO SERVE
