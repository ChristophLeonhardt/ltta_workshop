POLITICAL STUNT BY THE EAGLES

00:00:14,987 --> 00:00:16,122
FRANCHISE, THEN THEY WOULDN'T

4
00:00:16,122 --> 00:00:17,724
HAVE PLANNED TO ATTEND THE EVENT

00:00:17,724 --> 00:00:19,792
AND BACKED OUT AT THE LAST

6
00:00:19,792 --> 00:00:20,226
MINUTE.

7
00:00:20,226 --> 00:00:21,594
IF IT WASN'T A POLITICAL STUNT

8
00:00:21,594 --> 00:00:22,428
THEN THEY WOULDN'T HAVE

9
00:00:22,428 --> 00:00:23,096
ATTEMPTED TO RESCHEDULE THE

00:00:23,096 --> 00:00:25,264

PRESIDENT WAS GOING TO BE

00:00:26,432 --> 00:00:27,033
OVERSEAS.

13
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:28,434
IF THIS WASN'T A POLITICAL STUNT

14
00:00:28,434 --> 00:00:30,436
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE WAITED UNTIL

15
00:00:30,436 --> 00:00:31,571
MONDAY, WHILE AFTER A THOUSAND

16
00:00:31,571 --> 00:00:32,839

HANDFUL OF REPRESENTATIVES TO

PUBLICITY STUNT, ONE THAT

25
00:00:48,621 --> 00:00:50,056
PROMPTED THE RESIDENT TO CALL

LIKE.

36
00:01:07,373 --> 00:01:08,074
>> President Trump: WE STAND

37
00:01:08,074 --> 00:01:09,609

38
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:11,043
OUR COUNTRY AND TO REMEMBER THE

39
00:01:11,043 --> 00:01:11,778
FALLEN HEROES WHO NEVER MADE IT

40
00:01:11,778 --> 00:01:15,014
BACK HOME.

41
00:01:15,014 --> 00:01:18,418
WE STAND TO SHOW OUR LOVE FOR

42
00:01:18,418 --> 00:01:19,685
OUR FELLOW CITIZENS, AND OUR

00:01:19,685 --> 00:01:22,622
MAGNIFICENT CONSTITUTION.

44
00:01:22,622 --> 00:01:26,025
WE STAND TO PAY TRIBUTE TO THE

45
00:01:26,025 --> 00:01:28,227
INCREDIBLE AMERICANS WHO CAME

46
00:01:28,227 --> 00:01:30,630
BEFORE US, AND THE HEROIC

47
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,632
SACRIFICES THEY MADE.

00:01:32,632 --> 00:01:35,835
SO WE STAND TOGETHER FOR

49
00:01:35,835 --> 00:01:36,235
FREEDOM.

50
00:01:36,235 --> 00:01:38,271
WE STAND TOGETHER FOR

51
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:45,411
PATRIOTISM, AND WE PROUDLY STAND

52
00:01:45,411 --> 00:01:47,013
FOR OUR GLORIOUS NATION, UNDER

53
00:01:47,013 --> 00:01:47,413
GOD.

54
00:01:47,413 --> 00:01:49,215
>> Martha: HERE NOW, BILL

55
00:01:49,215 --> 00:01:54,420
BENNETT, A HOST OF THE BILL

56
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:54,954
BENNETT PODCAST.

57
00:01:54,954 --> 00:01:57,023
>> IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU IN

58
00:01:57,023 --> 00:01:57,790
PERSON.

59
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,625
LET'S PUT UP THIS QUOTE FROM THE

60
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:00,827
PHILADELPHIA MAYOR JIM KENNEY

61
00:02:00,827 --> 00:02:03,229
WHO TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE

62
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:03,830
SITUATION TODAY.

63
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,498
HE SAID THIS INVITING THEM FROM

64
00:02:05,498 --> 00:02:06,699
THE WHITE HOUSE PROVES THAT OUR

65
00:02:06,699 --> 00:02:10,169
PRESIDENT IS NOT A TRUE PATRIOT

66
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,438
BUT A FRAGILE EGO MANIAC WITH

67
00:02:12,438 --> 00:02:13,573
EMBARRASSMENT ABOUT THROWING

68
00:02:13,573 --> 00:02:16,075
PARTIES THAT NO ONE WANTS TO

69
00:02:16,075 --> 00:02:16,409
ATTEND.

70
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:19,212
DID HE HAVE A POINT OF ANY OF

71
00:02:19,212 --> 00:02:20,413
THAT?

72
00:02:20,413 --> 00:02:23,816
>> I THINK HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO

73
00:02:23,816 --> 00:02:25,218
SAY THINGS AND HE TOOK IT.

74
00:02:25,218 --> 00:02:28,020
FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T THINK YOU

75
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,724
ARE SIDE ABOUT THE EAGLES NOT

76
00:02:31,724 --> 00:02:32,058
COMING.

77
00:02:32,058 --> 00:02:33,426
>> IS THE EAGLES HAD ONE, WHICH

78
00:02:33,426 --> 00:02:34,827
IS WHAT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED

79
00:02:34,827 --> 00:02:36,629
THEY WOULD HAVE SHOWN UP.

80
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:39,298
>> WHAT DOES OUR FRIEND LAURA

81
00:02:39,298 --> 00:02:40,433
SAY?

82
00:02:40,433 --> 00:02:42,235
SHUT UP AND SAYING?

83
00:02:42,235 --> 00:02:43,236
SHUT UP AND PLAY.

84
00:02:43,236 --> 00:02:46,005
BY THE WAY, I AM A HUGE FOOTBALL

85
00:02:46,005 --> 00:02:47,073
FAN ALTHOUGH ITS COLLEGE GAMES

86
00:02:47,073 --> 00:02:47,840
FOR ME.

87
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,476
WE ARE THREE MONTHS AWAY, CAN WE

88
00:02:50,476 --> 00:02:51,844
THINK ABOUT THE CAPS FOR A

89
00:02:51,844 --> 00:02:54,046
MINUTE?

90
00:02:54,046 --> 00:03:01,821
YOU WANT TO SEE POLITICS?

91
00:03:01,821 --> 00:03:06,659
WHEN OVECHKIN COMES TO THE

92
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:07,059
WHITE HOUSE.

93
00:03:07,059 --> 00:03:07,860
THE PRESIDENT UNINVITED THEM

94
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,428
BECAUSE THEY SAID THEY WOULD

95
00:03:09,428 --> 00:03:10,496
HAVE FOUR OR FIVE GUYS COMING

96
00:03:10,496 --> 00:03:13,499
RATHER THAN 50 OR 60 OR 70,

97
00:03:13,499 --> 00:03:14,500
THAT'S CRAZY.

98
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,702
THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF UNKNOWN

99
00:03:16,836 --> 00:03:17,904
THAT THEY WERE SAYING THEY

100
00:03:17,904 --> 00:03:20,239
WANTED TO HAVE MEETINGS WITH THE

101
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:20,907
PRESIDENT FOR THE PRESIDENT

102
00:03:20,907 --> 00:03:21,641
DENIED IT.

103
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:22,508
I DON'T BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT

104
00:03:22,508 --> 00:03:26,379
WOULD WANT TO DENY A MEETING, HE

105
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:29,949
WOULD HAVE ONE OF THOSE

106
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:32,618
ROUNDTABLES THAT YOU SEE ON TV.

107
00:03:32,618 --> 00:03:33,352
BUT THE PRESIDENT INVITED THEM

108
00:03:33,352 --> 00:03:34,820
AND THEY SAID, WE WILL SEND FIVE

109
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,722
OR TEN PEOPLE.

110
00:03:36,722 --> 00:03:38,024
>> Martha: AND NOW IT TURNS

111
00:03:38,024 --> 00:03:39,559
INTO THIS WHOLE THING, NOW YOU

112
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:42,028
HAVE A LeBRON JAMES AND I KNOW

113
00:03:42,028 --> 00:03:43,629
REGARDLESS OF WHO WINS THE

114
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:44,263
SERIES, THEY PLAY THE

115
00:03:44,263 --> 00:03:46,132
GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS, NO ONE

116
00:03:46,132 --> 00:03:47,033
WANTS AN INVITE ANYWAY.

117
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:49,936
IF WE HAVE GOTTEN TO A POINT

118
00:03:49,936 --> 00:03:52,171
WHERE WE SHOULD STOP THIS WHOLE

119
00:03:52,171 --> 00:03:54,240
THING?

120
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,242
I THINK THE TEAM SHOULD JUST GO.

121
00:03:56,242 --> 00:03:59,779
>> YES, THEY SHOULD JUST GO.

122
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:02,014
THEY SHOULD JUST GO.

123
00:04:02,014 --> 00:04:03,215
I REMEMBER, BILL CLINTON IS NOT

124
00:04:03,215 --> 00:04:05,117
A GUY I LIKE TO COME IS NOT A

125
00:04:05,117 --> 00:04:06,018
PRESIDENT I ADMIRE.

126
00:04:06,018 --> 00:04:07,853
BUT WHEN HE CAME INTO THE ROOM

127
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:09,388
AND WE WERE AT THE KENNEDY

128
00:04:09,388 --> 00:04:12,124
CENTER, I SAID TO MY FAMILY, WE

129
00:04:12,124 --> 00:04:13,859
HAVE TO SLANT DUMB I CAN STAND

130
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:14,460
UP.

131
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,661
AND YOUR TEAM IS HONORED IN A

132
00:04:15,661 --> 00:04:18,331
WAY THAT THEY CAN'T BE HONORED

133
00:04:18,331 --> 00:04:20,099
IN ANY OTHER WAY.

134
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:22,134
>> BILL CLINTON HAS BEEN DIGGING

135
00:04:22,134 --> 00:04:24,604
A HOLE AND, HE COULD JUST KEEPS

136
00:04:24,604 --> 00:04:26,205
DIGGING THIS WEEK.

137
00:04:26,205 --> 00:04:27,406
HE BASICALLY WAS ASKED IN AN

138
00:04:27,406 --> 00:04:29,609
INTERVIEW WHETHER OR NOT HE

139
00:04:29,609 --> 00:04:30,810
SHOULD APOLOGIZE DIRECTLY TO

140
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:35,414
MONICA LEWINSKY GIVEN THE

141
00:04:35,414 --> 00:04:38,250
CONTEXT OF "ME TOO" NOW.

142
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,253
HE WAS OFFENDED THAT HE WAS EVEN

143
00:04:41,253 --> 00:04:42,254
ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT IT.

144
00:04:42,254 --> 00:04:45,658
>> IT WAS, HE HADN'T SEEN THAT

145
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:46,058
ONE BEFORE.

146
00:04:46,058 --> 00:04:48,027
I THINK PART OF IT IS, THE

147
00:04:48,027 --> 00:04:49,862
CLINTONS DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD

148
00:04:49,862 --> 00:04:50,863
BE ASKED TOUGH QUESTIONS.

149
00:04:50,863 --> 00:04:52,865
THIS HAS PASSED, THEY ARE ABOVE

150
00:04:52,865 --> 00:04:54,433
CRITICISM.

151
00:04:54,433 --> 00:04:56,168
BUT HE SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED

152
00:04:56,302 --> 00:04:57,637
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HE WOULD BE

153
00:04:57,637 --> 00:04:58,004
BETTER.

154
00:04:58,004 --> 00:04:59,605
BUT HE'S GOT TO FACE THE FACT,

155
00:04:59,605 --> 00:05:02,008
WE ARE IN A DIFFERENT MOMENT

156
00:05:02,008 --> 00:05:02,808
NOW.

157
00:05:02,808 --> 00:05:04,410
LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS.

158
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,912
THE MONICA LEWINSKY TIME, IT WAS

159
00:05:06,912 --> 00:05:08,814
A DIFFERENT MOMENT FOR WOMEN.

160
00:05:08,814 --> 00:05:12,084
IT WAS, I AM WOMEN HEAR ME ROAR,

161
00:05:12,084 --> 00:05:15,221
SHE'S EMPOWERED, SHE'S A WOMAN.

162
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:17,623
NOW MONICA IS COMING TO A

163
00:05:17,623 --> 00:05:19,225
REALIZATION, MAYBE I WAS TAKEN

164
00:05:19,225 --> 00:05:19,825
ADVANTAGE OF.

165
00:05:19,825 --> 00:05:21,360
YOU SURE WERE TAKEN ADVANTAGE

166
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,629
OF, YOU ARE ALSO IMPLICIT IN

167
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:25,231
WHAT YOU DID.

168
00:05:25,231 --> 00:05:26,232
BUT CLINTON DOESN'T THINK HE

169
00:05:26,232 --> 00:05:29,301
SHOULD APOLOGIZE FOR IT NOW.

170
00:05:29,435 --> 00:05:32,438
A BOOK, AND HE IS WRONG NOW.

171
00:05:32,438 --> 00:05:34,240
>> Martha: IT'S NOT GOING TO

172
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,675
GET BETTER FOR HIM.

173
00:05:35,675 --> 00:05:36,876
ANITA BRODERICK IS -- IT'S NOT

174
00:05:36,876 --> 00:05:38,744
AS IF YOU CAN PASS IT OFF LIKE,

175
00:05:38,744 --> 00:05:45,484
THERE WAS JUST THIS ONE AFFAIR.

176
00:05:45,484 --> 00:05:46,218
THERE ARE TOO MANY OTHER THINGS

177
00:05:46,218 --> 00:05:47,787
OUT THERE WHICH WILL BE MORE AND

178
00:05:47,787 --> 00:05:50,189
MORE DIFFICULT.

179
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:53,292
AND EVEN, DID YOU SEE THE POLE

180
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:55,027
OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROFESSORS --

181
00:05:55,027 --> 00:05:58,030
WHILE THEY ARE ALL DEMOCRATS,

182
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,232
SAYING HIS STANDINGS HAVE

183
00:06:00,232 --> 00:06:02,535
DROPPED BY ABOUT TEN SLICES

184
00:06:02,535 --> 00:06:04,904
BECAUSE OF THE "ME TOO"

185
00:06:04,904 --> 00:06:05,271
MOVEMENT.

186
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:08,774
HE'S GOING TO RUN INTO THIS

187
00:06:08,774 --> 00:06:09,175
EVERYWHERE.

188
00:06:09,175 --> 00:06:10,710
>> Martha: SOME WILL RISE OVER

189
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,812
