2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,830
son Achilles I felt like making a video

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,540
today<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I had a really good class</font>

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,059
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Iliad we're talking about the bit</font>

5
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:10,320
when Athena comes down and says

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,330
basically you need to check your rage

7
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,160
please and you need to yield which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,960
think was the take a chill pill of the

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,699
ancient Greeks maybe the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

10
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,289
Iliad is a study in what it will take

11
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:21,980
for someone to yield

12
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,810
sometimes giving in isn't a good thing

13
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,760
but then sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just swallow your</font>

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,439
pride you need to accept that there's

15
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:28,849
anything much you can do I think

16
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:30,169
although a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot is said about pushing</font>

17
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:32,390
yourself and trying harder and striving

18
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,100
and I think that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very important I</font>

19
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,750
think to<font color="#E5E5E5"> some degree you need to yield</font>

20
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,579
to your abilities I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> watching a lot</font>

21
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,930
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those videos where you talk to your</font>

22
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,059
past self and your future self and I was

23
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:42,110
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what advice I'd give</font>

24
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,660
myself from the past from when I was 12

25
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,059
or 13 or 14 or 15 or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever the truth</font>

26
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:48,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">is I can't remember what it was like to</font>

27
00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:50,120
be 12 or 13 anymore and that thought

28
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,030
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> scares</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me 15 16 17 18 is still</font>

29
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,800
very clear in my mind and if I were to

30
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">go back and read my Diaries from when I</font>

31
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:58,010
was 12 and 13 then I'd probably start

32
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,420
remembering what it thought life or at

33
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,309
least when I wrote down<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it felt</font>

34
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:03,079
like but when I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> back the i get an</font>

35
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:04,849
overwhelming sense of just being

36
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:07,340
stressed and working all the time of

37
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,630
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling that anything is possible</font>

38
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,729
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you work hard enough yes but also</font>

39
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:12,950
that you must you always must work

40
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,240
yourself to the point of absolute

41
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,830
exhaustion otherwise there's no point

42
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,720
there is no<font color="#CCCCCC"> way that you're going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

43
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,070
anything you want I don't know that

44
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,660
that's necessarily true and I think it

45
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,340
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> implies that if you do push</font>

46
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,289
yourself at hard if you do work yourself

47
00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:25,820
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the bone then you will get what</font>

48
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,380
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want which isn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the case I hate to</font>

49
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,310
bring this up again but I haven't

50
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,720
brought it up for a while<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I have</font>

51
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,280
been thinking about it for as<font color="#CCCCCC"> long as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

52
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,959
can remember I wanted to go to Oxford it

53
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,520
was a big thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me I thought it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

54
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,200
important to who I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was I thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

55
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,940
necessary to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything that I wanted</font>

56
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do I thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the only way to</font>

57
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:41,000
achieve that was to push myself into a

58
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,560
breaking point and that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

59
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,209
I was basically guaranteed a place i

60
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:45,470
think that was somewhere the back of my

61
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">mind I didn't realize that until about a</font>

few weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago but here I am I'm not</font>

Oxford in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact I would argue that I am</font>

64
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">better for it it's taken me a long while</font>

65
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,369
to realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that whenever something</font>

66
00:01:55,369 --> 00:01:56,869
didn't come through and i felt like i

67
00:01:56,869 --> 00:01:58,610
was doing all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right things together</font>

68
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,470
I was so angry at myself I was so

69
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,479
annoyed I was like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jagr miss a step but</font>

70
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:03,890
maybe it wasn't my anger that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to</font>

71
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">check it's this obsession that if you</font>

72
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:08,179
fulfill certain criteria then X will

73
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:09,830
happen and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes you just need to</font>

74

76
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,290
wait for that to happen but don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font>

77
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,300
that wants you to check overcome and you

would<font color="#CCCCCC"> overtake your life I don't know</font>

79
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,420
this probably didn't make sense but I've

80
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking a lot about the past five</font>

six years and everything has taken to

82
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,910
get me to this point where<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am now and</font>

00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,610
whether I would have changed things I'm

I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have changed things but i</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just more important</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too gay</font>

86
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,540
for words rather than to be going

backwards to concentrate<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> please just reality that you</font>

94
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,500
sometimes have to come to terms with

<font color="#E5E5E5">runny were 19 I hope you're having a</font>

lovely day gossip girl starts a week on

97
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,410
Monday I'm very excited for it it seems

98
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,970
kind of wrong talking about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> iliad</font>

99
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,310
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> gossip girl on the same m38 but I</font>

just didn't now please go and watch my

101
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,790
friend George's video with her singing a

102
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,950
popular song by a small child I mean

103
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,810
she's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good it's a small child I</font>

104
00:03:01,810 --> 00:00:00,000
have to question
