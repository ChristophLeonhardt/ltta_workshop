1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,199
MARIAH CAREY HAS
BEEN ACCUSED OF SEXUAL

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:07,940
HARASSMENT BY HER FORMER
SECURITY GUARD. MIGHT GO AND

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,889
ELLA WHO IS THE CEO OF LOS
ANGELES-BASED AND NOAH

4
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:15,200
CONSULTING IS ACTUALLY
THREATENING TO SUE HER FOR

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,179
UNPAID BILLS AND EXCESS OF
$220,000 FOR WORK UNDERTAKEN

6
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:31,930
BETWEEN JUNE 2015 AND MAY 2017.
FURTHER:

7
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:55,109
OBVIOUSLY THERE IS 

8
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:56,740
ARE ALL
ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE HAPPENING

9
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,289
RIGHT NOW AND OBVIOUSLY THINK IN
THE MIDST OF ALL OF THE HARVEY

10
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:05,920
WEINSTEIN FOLLOW IN ALL OF THESE
OTHER FAMOUS PEOPLE IN HOLLYWOOD

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,950
BEING BROUGHT DOWN BY SEXUAL
HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL ABUSE

12
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,080
CLAIMS AND ALLEGATIONS, THIS IS
ADDING TO THE LIST WITH A LITTLE

13
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,890
BIT OF A TWIST, REQUEST ON A LOT
OF THESE CASES WE'VE SEEN WOMEN

14
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,880
ACCUSING MEN OF THESE ACTIONS
AND NOW THIS SORT OF FLIPS THE

15
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,149
TABLE. WHAT YOU GUYS THINK ABOUT
THIS?

16
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:30,610
>> GO-AHEAD.

17
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:35,220
>> I FEEL LIKE I JUMP IN
IMMEDIATELY.

18
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,440
>> GO-AHEAD.

19
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,259
>> YEAH, IF YOU ARE SEXUALLY
HARASSING PEOPLE, I THINK THE

20
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,570
ACCUSATIONS SHOULD COME FORWARD
AND WE SHOULD INVESTIGATE AND

21
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,200
FIND OUT WHO IT IS REGARDLESS OF
THE GENDER OF THE PERSON WHO IS

22
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,030
ACTUALLY PERPETUATING THE SEXUAL
HARASSMENT. I THINK SOME OF THE

23
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,600
CLAIMS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC NUMBER I

24
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,279
CARRIES ALWAYS IN A N…GLIG…E.

25
00:01:57,279 --> 00:01:58,279
>> HAVE YOU SEEN HER MUSIC
VIDEOS?

26
00:01:58,279 --> 00:02:03,700
>> I'VE NEVER NOT SEEN HER
ALMOST NAKED, SO IT IS PROBABLY

27
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,450
ALSO THE LAZIEST SEXUAL
HARASSMENT, BASED ON HER

28
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:12,010
PERFORMANCES, AND HAS TO BE
REALLY BAD, BUT AGAIN,

29
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,540
HARASSMENT OF ANY FORM HAS TO BE
TAKEN SERIOUSLY, FOLKS NEED

30
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,040
TO COME FORWARD AND HE NEEDS TO
FILE THIS SO CAN BE FURTHER

31
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,040
INVESTIGATED.

32
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,090
>> YES. I AGREE WITH YOU GUYS.
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO

33
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,100
RECOGNIZE THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT
AND SEXUAL ABUSE HAPPENS TO MEN

34
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,012
TOO AND I THINK THAT IS AN
IMPORTANT SORT OF NUANCE TO A

35
00:02:31,012 --> 00:02:33,320
LOT OF THE ALLEGATIONS THAT WE
ARE SEEING IN THE MEDIA RIGHT

36
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:40,560
NOW. THAT SAID, THERE'S A LOT
GOING ON HERE. HE IS UNPAID.

37
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,611
HE IS SAYING THAT SHE IS RACIST.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE IS

38
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:48,870
SAYING SHE SAID WAS THAT SHE WAS
RACIST BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO BE

39
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,920
SURROUNDED BY BLACK GUYS AND NOT
WHITE PEOPLE. 1ST OF ALL,

40
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,670
REVERSE RACISM IS NOT A THING SO
THAT IS THE FIRST THING.

41
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,670
NOT A THING.

42
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,500
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT THAT MEANS.

43
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,470
WHAT IS REFERS RACISM NOT A
THING ME?

44
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,570
>> WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT
AND IS HIM, LIKE SEXISM, RACISM,

45
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,080
WHATEVER IT IS. YOU CAN DO A
BETTER JOB OF THIS BECAUSE YOU

46
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,680
ARE A SOCIOLOGIST BUT YOU ARE
ALSO LOOK AT THE OPPRESSOR AND

47
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,900
OPPRESSED AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK
AT THAT DYNAMIC IN THE SYSTEMIC

48
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,380
PROBLEMS, THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS,
THEY ARE GOING TO BE INDIVIDUAL

49
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,810
BIASES AND STEREOTYPES AND
THINGS LIKE THAT BUT WHEN YOU

50
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,080
ARE LOOKING AT IS A SYSTEMIC
LEVEL THE OPPRESSED CAN'T

51
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,790
BE RACIST OR SEXIST AGAINST THE
OPPRESSOR.

52
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:38,650
>> BUT WHAT IF SHE'S LIKE I HATE
WHITE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY

53
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,260
ARE INHERENTLY INFERIOR TO ME.

54
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,510
SO I DO NOT WANT THEM AROUND ME?

55
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:49,040
>> THERE CAN BE AN INDIVIDUAL
THAT CAN FEEL THAT WAY, BUT IT

56
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,230
IS NOT THE WHOLE RACISM BECAUSE
IT IS NOT A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM.

57
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,990
>> I GET WHAT YOU WERE SAYING.
I THINK THOSE WORDS, I GET IT.

58
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,100
YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO
CONSIDERATION THE HISTORICAL

59
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,760
LEGACY OF OPPRESSION AND THE
THINGS THAT BEEN HAPPENING SINCE

60
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,250
SLAVERY BUT IT IS LIKE, IF SHE
IS BEING RACIST WHITE PEOPLE,

61
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,160
SHE CAN BE RACIST FOR
WHITE PEOPLE, RIGHT?

62
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,339
I AS A JEW CAN BE RACIST TOWARD
PEOPLE WHO HAVE OPPRESSED

63
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,399
ME IN THE PAST.

64
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,339
>> I THINK IT IS JUST THE WAY
WE'RE USING THESE TERMS AND I

65
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:24,880
THINK WE GET CAUGHT UP IN HOW
WE, SEMANTICS AROUND THESE

66
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,290
THINGS. SHE IS DISPLAYING
BIGOTED BEHAVIOR AND SAYING

67
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:31,900
THINGS THAT ARE RACIST. SHE MAY
BE DISCRIMINATING IN THIS

68
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,720
PARTICULAR CASE BECAUSE IT IS
THE WORKPLACE WHICH I THINK IS

69
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,280
PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE YOU SHOULD
EXERT SOME SORT OF CONTROL OVER

70
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,720
WHO IS HIRED IF YOU DO OF THE
ISSUE, THEN WHY IS IT ON DISPLAY

71
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,290
IN THESE INTERPERSONAL
INTERACTIONS WHEN HE IS AN

72
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,090
ASSISTANT, A BODYGUARD.

73
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,790
>> YOU EXERT SOME CONTROL OVER
WHO IS BEING HIRED AND NOT TO

74
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:57,600
SAY THAT SHE IS NOT OPENLY
DISCRIMINATING BY NOT ACTIVELY

75
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,490
HIRING WHITE PEOPLE. I DON'T
KNOW, I FEEL LIKE HER ETHNICITY

76
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:06,170
IS KIND OF AMBIGUOUS OF THIS IS
KIND OF AN INTERESTING CASE. IN

77
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,930
ANY LIGHT THINK ALL FORMS OF
DISCRIMINATION OR HARASSMENT

78
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,750
NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED AND
TAKEN SERIOUSLY. IT'S A LITTLE

79
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:17,040
NEBULOUS HERE AS TO WHAT IS
HAPPENED AND I THINK THAT

80
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,800
IS WHY IT IS JUST A LITTLE
TRICKY TO SUSS OUT.

81
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,580
>> IN ANY CRIME IT SEEMS THERE
IS AN ACT IN AN INTENSE THAT YOU

82
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,610
CAN BE IN MARIAH CAREY AND SHE
IS IN REVEALING OUTFITS AND IT

83
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,250
IS THE STAGE AT THE GRAMMYS AND
THERE IS ONE WHEN SHE IS IN A

84
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,360
REVEALING OUTFIT AND SHE IS
INTENTIONALLY MAKING YOU FEEL

85
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,250
AWKWARD AND POWERLESS WHEN SHE
IS MAKING YOU COME IN AND TAKE

86
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,190
HER LUGGAGE AWAY, WHEN YOU
OBVIOUSLY HAVE SAID THAT THIS

87
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,211
MAKES YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE IN
THIS NOT PART OF YOUR JOB AND IT

88
00:05:47,211 --> 00:05:48,290
SHOULDN'T BE PART OF YOUR JOB.

89
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:53,110
>> I AGREE WITH YOU. THERE ARE
OTHER ALLEGATIONS THAT I'VE READ

90
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,660
FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES, ONE OF
WHICH SAYING THAT SHE WAS

91
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,500
PARTAKING IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY
WITH SOMEBODY AND HE FELT LIKE

92
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,139
SHE WAS MAKING SURE THEY HE
WITNESSED IT.

93
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,350
>> THAT IS CREEPY.

94
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:08,550
>> YOU ARE ALSO A SECURITY GUARD
AND IF YOU WERE STANDING OUTSIDE

95
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:13,790
OF HER ROOM TO PROTECT SOMEBODY,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LINES ARE.

96
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,310
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
BECAUSE THIS IS ALL SORT OF

97
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,090
COMING OUT RIGHT NOW AND I THINK
THERE IS A LOT WE STILL NEED TO

98
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:25,880
LOOK INTO. THAT SAID, I THINK
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STORY

99
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,410
BECAUSE SEXUAL-HARASSMENT
OBVIOUSLY CAN HAPPEN TO MEN TO

100
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:35,030
AS WE'VE SEEN IN THAT KEVIN
SPACEY ALLEGATIONS AND NOW

101
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:38,011
POTENTIALLY IN THEM OR I CARRY
ALLEGATIONS TO.

102
00:06:38,011 --> 00:06:41,020
>> AND THINK IT IS INTERESTING
BECAUSE IT IS ANOTHER CASE,

103
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,770
ALTHOUGH NOT AS CLEAR, HOW DO
YOU MAINTAIN PROFESSIONALISM IN

104
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,470
THESE PROFESSIONAL SPACES.
THINK WITH FIGURE OUT HOW TO

105
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:50,990
CARVEOUT BOUNDARIES THAT ARE
CLEAR BECAUSE THIS ISN'T A

106
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,340
FORMAL OFFICE SPACE. YOU ARE A
SECURITY GUARD SO THEY DO KIND

107
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,040
OF TRAVERSE THE BOUNDARIES OF
INTERPERSONAL INTERACTIONS.

108
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,440
THEY ARE THERE WHEN YOU ARE
CHANGING OR POSSIBLY SLEEPING

109
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,700
WITH SOMEONE SO HOW DO YOU
DEFINE WHAT HARASSMENT IS.

110
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,100
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE, I GUESS IT
PROBABLY HAPPENS IN GAME OF

111
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,470
THRONES BUT I REMEMBER THERE'S A
SHOW CALLED ROMER SHE IS HAVING

112
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:18,230
SEX AND ALL OF HER GUYS ARE
STANDING AROUND IN A CIRCLE. IT

113
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,380
SEEMS LIKE THESE ARCHAIC
TERRIFYING MEDIEVAL SITUATIONS.

114
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:26,620
I WILL SAY THAT I AM GLAD THAT
HOLLYWOOD IS CHANGING. I WAS AN

115
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,340
ASSISTANT AT A TALENT AGENCY AND
I WAS RIGHT FOR GREAT PEOPLE BUT

116
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,250
YOU WOULD BE ON THE PHONE,
LISTENING AND EVERYBODY'S

117
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,340
CONVERSATIONS UNLESS YOU NEED IN
CASE YOU NEED TO SEND A PACKAGE

118
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:39,130
OR SOMETHING AND YOU HEAR IT,
JUST TERRIFYING THINGS ON THE

119
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:42,360
PHONE AND YOU HEAR STORIES FROM
OTHER ASSISTANTS WORKING OTHER

120
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,030
PLACES AND I TALKED TO VARIOUS
PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY

121
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,681
AND THEY HAVE SAID TIMES HAVE
CHANGED. THEY KNOW THAT THIS IS

122
00:07:50,681 --> 00:07:55,710
HAPPENING AND HR DEPARTMENTS
EXIST NOW WHEREAS BEFORE IT WAS

123
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:59,580
JUST THE PERSON WHO SIGNED YOUR
CHECK AND THERE WASN'T A REAL,

124
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,190
FULLY DEVELOPED HR DEPARTMENT
YOU COULD GO TO AND I HEARD OF

125
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:08,230
ONE STORY WHERE, IN MY DAY, YOU
HEAR THESE THINGS ABOUT, WHAT

126
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:12,270
ARE YOU WEARING KIND OF TEXT
GOING TO ASSISTANTS AND SAYING

127
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:17,169
REALLY UNTOWARD HORRIBLE THINGS
AND THEN I HEARD ONE STORY ABOUT

128
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:20,840
SOMEONE WHO JUST SENT ONE TEXT
THAT WAS MORE ABOUT WHERE ARE

129
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,250
YOU RIGHT NOW WHICH COULD BE A
BUNCH OF THINGS BUT AS AN

130
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,910
ASSISTANCE AFTER HOURS YOU WOULD
GET CALLED TO MAKE A DELIVERY

131
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:33,510
8:30 PM ON A FRIDAY NIGHT, YOU
JUST HAD TO DO IT BECAUSE IT WAS

132
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,510
PART OF YOUR JOB AT THE
AMBIGUITY THERE, THEY WERE BOTH

133
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:40,100
BROUGHT IN AND ASKED TO HASH IT
OUT AND ESTABLISH THOSE

134
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,770
BOUNDARIES WHICH IS A VERY
RESPONSIBLE STEP WHICH I

135
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,010
DON'T REMEMBER EXACTLY HAPPENING
15 YEARS AGO.

136
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,070
>> I THINK THAT IS REALLY
IMPORTANT TO KIND OF PIGGYBACK

137
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,710
OFF OF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING AND
TO ADDRESS WHAT YOU SAID, I

138
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:56,990
THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO REALLY
DEFINE WHAT SEXUAL-HARASSMENT

139
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,410
IS, WHAT SEXUAL ABUSES AND
SEXUAL ASSAULT IN ALL THOSE

140
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:03,691
THINGS BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH WE
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO. WE SHOULD

141
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:07,440
KNOW WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE, I
THINK RIGHT NOW IT DOES SEEM A

142
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,610
LITTLE BIT NEBULOUS AND WE DON'T
KNOW HOW TO DO IT IN DIFFERENT

143
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:13,580
SCENARIOS WHEN IT IS THE
INTERPERSONAL AND YOU HAVE

144
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,180
BUSINESS SORT OF MIXING WHERE
YOU'D ARE DOING LATE-NIGHT

145
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,990
DELIVERIES AND YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW TO INTERPRET TEXT OR

146
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:23,400
WHATEVER IT MAY BE. THERE IS A
LOT OF CONFUSION. EVEN THOUGH

147
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,529
MAYBE THERE SHOULDN'T BE, I
STILL THINK THAT IT EXISTS SO

148
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:30,540
LET'S DEFINE IT, YOU KNOW WHAT I
MEAN? BREAK IT DOWN, EVERY

149
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,130
LITTLE THING RIGHT HERE IS
CONSIDERED SEXUAL-HARASSMENT,

150
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,430
THIS IS SEXUAL ASSAULT, THIS IS
SEXUAL ABUSE. I THINK WE REALLY

151
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:42,840
NEED TO BE VERY SPECIFIC SO
PEOPLE, EXCEPT FOR SOME OF THE

152
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:48,270
BIGGEST OFFENDERS, I THINK IF
THEY ARE SEEMINGLY INNOCUOUS, I

153
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:53,250
THING NOBODY REALLY WANTS TO BE
CREEPY OR HARASSING.

154
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,279
>> I DON'T KNOW. I THINK THERE
ARE SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE BUT

155
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:02,470
FOR YOUR EVERY DAY SORT OF WINK
AT THE WOMAN AND THINGS LIKE

156
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,160
THAT, I THINK IF YOU ARE MADE
CLEAR, HEY, THAT IS

157
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,690
SEXUAL-HARASSMENT THE NAVY
FEWER PEOPLE WOULD DO IT.

158
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:12,930
I THINK, I HOPE.

159
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,560
>> I THE SAME REACTION. I HEAR
THAT AND I WANT TO BELIEVE IT SO

160
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,210
BADLY, BUT I THINK THAT
ENTERTAINMENT IS A SPECIFIC KIND

161
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:25,400
OF INDUSTRY THAT YOU GET INTO
FOR THE POWER AND THE COOLNESS

162
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,150
OF IT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
DRAWN TO FOR THOSE REASONS.

163
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:32,790
THERE ARE THE PURE ARTISTS AND
THE PRODUCERS THAT ARE REALLY IN

164
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,770
IT TO MAKE AMAZING ARTS BUT
THERE ARE ALSO PEOPLE THERE JUST

165
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:41,890
TO GO TO PARTIES AND GET DRUNK
AND GET CHICKS. THAT INSTINCT

166
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,560
IS STILL OUT THERE.

167
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,820
>> I THINK IT EXISTS, THAT
STARTS IN FRATERNITIES.

168
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,260
>> IT IS VERY FRIDAY.

169
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:55,310
>> THIS IS A PERVASIVE ISSUE.
THERE ARE MANY WORKPLACES THAT

170
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,520
ARE UNDER FIRE NOW BECAUSE THE
COCKTAIL PARTY GOT TOO OUT OF

171
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,640
CONTROL AND YOUR BOSS CAME UP
AND SAID SOMETHING

172
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,610
INAPPROPRIATE, RIGHT? THAT IS
JUST PAR FOR THE COURSE. TO

173
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,600
YOUR POINT, DIFFERENT PEOPLE
HAVE DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS OF

174
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,529
WHAT THEY THINK
SEXUAL-HARASSMENT OR ASSAULT IS.

175
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:12,399
THEY EVEN BASE IT ON THE TYPE
OF THE RELATIONSHIP THEY THINK

176
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,190
THEY HAVE WITH THEIR COWORKER.
OH, WE ARE COOL SO I AM GOING TO

177
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,190
SAY

178
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,060
SOMETHING WILDLY
INAPPROPRIATE BECAUSE THAT IS

179
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,089
HANNAH. IT'S LIKE ACTUALLY WE
STILL WORK TOGETHER, THERE

180
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:26,800
SHOULD BE SOME BOUNDARIES. IT
IS A DICEY ISSUE. I THINK

181
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,890
PARTICULARLY THINGS MAY CHANGE A
LITTLE BIT MORE IN MEDIA BECAUSE

182
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:35,110
OF THE STIGMA AROUND KIND OF
BEING OUTED. I THINK THAT

183
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:39,040
DOESN'T HAPPEN SO MUCH WHERE THE
REGULAR WORKPLACES. NO ONE IS

184
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,090
WONDERING WHAT FEDEX IS DOING
BUT SOME OF THESE CORPORATIONS

185
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:46,740
OR PUBLIC FIGURES WERE LIKE OH,
YOU ARE HARASSING PEOPLE?

186
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,450
I'M NOT GOING TO WATCH HOUSE OF
CARDS.

187
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:51,709
>> HAVING A PLATFORM IS A HUGE
DEAL.

188
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:54,900
>> SIMILAR TO THAT I TALKED TO A
PRODUCER WHO HAS BEEN IN THE

189
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,209
TOWN FOR PROBABLY 30

190
00:11:57,209 --> 00:12:01,339
YEARS AND HE SAID THAT HE THINKS
IT IS BECAUSE THE INSURANCE

191
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:04,060
COMPANIES ARE LIKE, WE ARE NOT
GOING TO DO SETTLEMENTS ANYMORE.

192
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,090
>> IT IS ALL ABOUT PROFIT.
PEOPLE ARE GETTING BETTER AT IT.

193
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,270
THE PEOPLE WHO YOU BEEN ABLE TO
SCARE INTO SUBMISSION FOR SO

194
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:14,020
LONG ARE NOT AS FRIGHTENED
ANYMORE. THEY ARE GOING TO TELL

195
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,270
ON YOU AND THEY ARE GOING TO
HAVE A GOOD CASE BECAUSE

196
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,959
EVERYTHING, WHEREAS BEFORE WAS A
PHONE CALL THAT THEY MADE, NOW

197
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:25,410
IT'S A TEXT MESSAGE AND AN EMAIL
THAT THEY CAN PRINT OUT AND SHOW

198
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:30,440
IN COURT AND HE IS JUST LIKE
YEAH, FOR WHATEVER REASON,

199
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,960
ACTUALLY GETS IT TO HAPPEN
EVEN IF IT IS THE INSURANCE

200
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,079
COMPANY THIS IS A GOOD THING
THAT IS HAPPENING.

201
00:12:35,079 --> 00:00:00,000
>> BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY HAS
INTEGRITY.
