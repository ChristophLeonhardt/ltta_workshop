President Putin says the suspects name by Britain over the scrapple poisoning have been identified by Russia he was speaking in the past hour or so at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok let's go there now RT correspondent Elia Petrecca is there for us hi again and take us through what the president said heigen call well this is an absolutely unexpected follow-up from Vladimir Putin to last week's groundbreaking statements from the British authorities on the script all case suspects the Russian leader says that Moscow knows for sure who the men are so let's not waste time and hear what exactly mr. Putin said we've seen the pictures we know who they are we found them hopefully they will turn themselves in and will tell everyone about themselves there's nothing special or criminal are they civilians yes they are definitely civilians last week exactly six months after the attempted Nava Chak murder in Salisbury the British prosecutors named two suspects in the script pal case as Russian nationals Alexander Petrov and Ruslan bashira they also pointed out that the names that they were using could have been fake another claim was that the two men were active members of Russia's intelligence and the British prosecutors even put forward an alleged timeline of their movements in Britain so these comments from the Russian President are no less groundbreaking compared to what we heard from London last week and now I guess once again it's their turn to say something okay yeah early days yet and you've been about an hour or so since we heard this from President Putin but we'll keep watch on that as indeed you will it Vladivostok for now though Elliot Petrenko thanks for that you
