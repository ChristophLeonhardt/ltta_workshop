let's talk about North Korea actually because one thing Donald Trump has said that he wants out of the Chinese is he wants them to be more helpful in the North Korean relationship putting pressure on them about their nuclear program obviously it's not the first American president who's wanted that out of China I just wonder looking at the situation why isn't China more helpful there I don't see how it's at all in their interest to have North Korea making all sorts of trouble well it's not in their in to have North Korea make this trouble it's not in their interest to have a war or whatever it on the other hand China is very worried about a couple things one is a potentially a reunified Korean Peninsula but Seoul is its capital in the American strategic orbit they're extremely worried of that kind of a geopolitical icon they kind of like a divided Korea just like they prefer two divided Vietnam back when they don't want to have millions of refugees coming across their border there's certain people conservatives in China who are close to North Korea because the Communist Party ties over the decades so China they hate the North Koreans by the way you give you have a couple of beers with your Chinese friends they will tell you what they think of the North Koreans there's no there's no love loss there but they are worried about strategic change on the peninsula which unbalance would would hurt them and the result is they have been unwilling to use the leverage they say they don't have but they really do because most of North Korea's trade goes in and out of China China subsidizes North Korea China has been loath to use its influence or all of its influence for fear of bringing North Korea down and what that might set in train
