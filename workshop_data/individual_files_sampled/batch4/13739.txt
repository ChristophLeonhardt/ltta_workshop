president Trump I do love the fact that for president from not only does he never back down he always doubles down like everything is a double down for for president Trump if you ever played poker with him you would always want to go all-in and this is sort of the problem the reason being that half the time he's bluffing and half the time he's not and you really don't know when he's bluffing and when he's not but you have a pretty good indication that he's bluffing sometimes because he can never get out of a hand he never just puts it down and says okay walk away from this hand everything has to be doubled down on so you remember a couple of days ago Trump said about North Korea that if North Korea were to continue to threaten then he would unleash the fire in the fury and frankly the power remember all of us fire furious furious frankly power Mad Max fury road unbelievable Draconis and so everyone went nuts but the left just thought this is insane he's going to burn everyone alive and I was saying calm down everyone that's not going to happen there are negotiations happening behind the scenes sweet stuff because that's what Trump does and even the North Koreans know better than to fire a nuclear missile just because Trump is mouthing off they know enough to know that should they actually try something we would finish them they would be done so this morning Trump tweeted out military solutions are now fully in place locked and loaded should North Korea act unwisely hopefully Kim jong-un will find another path again everybody - oh it's an escalation a dramatic escalation the rhetoric is escalating the activity is not so we are doing the same FiOS flyovers of North Korea that we've always been doing we've been doing the same in joint naval exercises with the Japanese and with the South Koreans rather with the South Koreans that we've always been doing nothing has really changed along those scores so the idea that Trump is dramatically escalating the situation it's just not true but his rhetoric is constantly escalating because Trump gets a high off of his own fumes when it comes to the level of his rhetoric I mean this is why he has people apparently bring him folders filled with pictures of him looking powerful so yesterday he's asked about the player in the fury and the fury Oh said phenomenal phenomenal fury and he was and he says not only was I right then I'm going to double down it's not even big enough I think we have to go even bigger with the rhetoric and frankly the people that were questioning that statement was a two-top maybe it wasn't tough enough they've been doing this in our country for a long time for many years and it's about time that somebody stuck up for the people of this country and for the people of other countries so if anything maybe that statement wasn't tough enough and we're backed by a hundred percent by our military would backed by everybody and were backed by many other leaders and I noticed that many senators and others today came out very much in favor of what I said but if anything that statement may not be tough enough it teacher I love that I keep saying that the statement it may not be tough enough he doesn't stirring the campaign alot also any time he was asked about something he would say there's some people who's saying I didn't go far enough maybe I should have gone farther I should have talked about the ferocity frenzy theater I should go into fierceness and the flare up in the Thor's she talked about all of those things just for alliterative purposes alliteration is where the first letter is the same of other words in the sound is the same yes beep-bop okay so is all of this helpful you know I honestly I don't think it's that bad I don't think it hurts I don't think it's the end of the world I don't think we're going to get in the nuclear war because Trump is doing any of this stuff and all the media members attempting to push you into feeling this way have an agenda as we discussed yesterday Trump said listen this is not a dare you know I'm not daring North Korea to do anything I'm just stating if they do something then we'll finish them let's see what he does with Guam he does something in Guam it will be an event the likes of which nobody's seen before what will happen in North Korea I mean you'll see you'll see and he'll see and he will see is that a dare it's a statement has nothing to do with there that's a statement he's not going to go around threatening Guam and he's not going to threaten the United States and he was not going to threaten Japan and he's not going to threaten South Korea no that's not a dare as you say that is a statement of fact so what the actual likelihood of anything happening here very low because here's the reality the Kim jong-un regime is mainly interested in self-preservation it's a stable regime because they don't care if they continue killing their own people and oppressing their own people for decades now that they've been doing it now for 60 odd years so nothing really changes there all they care about is maintaining their own power and that means the last thing they're going to do is launch a nuclear weapon and Guam or launch a nuclear weapon at the United States what they could do is act bellicose in an attempt to gain concessions from the world because this is what they've been doing for the past couple of decades if Trump shows that they're not going to get any concessions for this then in fact you're going to ratchet up sanctions every time they do this then maybe they'll cut out even that now is that the greatest possible outcome no I mean it would be great if the Kim family would just all drop dead immediately that would be the best possible outcome for the world the best possible outcome for the North Korean people who don't deserve this monstrosity that's been thrust upon them for the better part of half a century but that said are we at the verge of nuclear war no we're not now what is the danger of them having a weapon like this there are really two dangers of the North Koreans having an intercontinental ballistic missile with an atomic tip okay there are two basic threats one threat is that all of the of neighboring all the neighboring countries are then once say okay well if they have a nuclear weapon we should have a nuclear weapon like South Korea will say listen we can't be living under the nuclear umbrella of the North Koreans we should have the capacity to say to them if you fire anything at us we will nuke you right if you're if you fire conventional weaponry at us and then threaten us with your nuclear weapon we will finish you right so the South Koreans might develop their own nuclear weapon Japan which has been non-nuclear they may develop their own nuclear weapon in order to deter the the North Koreans and so you could see widespread proliferation around the world and Jang Hut horas is making this point in his commentary podcast and I think it's right that we've spent again every basically every waking moment since 1945 and the use of da bomb in Hiroshima and Nagasaki we've been spending all that time trying to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons there been a number of states like South Africa and I'm going non-nuclear Libya was giving up its nuclear ambitions you know there been a number of states that have decided not to go nuclear specifically because is they felt like there is a global taboo against the use of nuclear weapons but now you're seeing proliferation spread Pakistan is proliferating Iran is going to proliferate thanks to the Obama administration Saudi Arabia in response could proliferate thanks to the Obama administration you could see Turkey and Jordan proliferate you could see a widespread development of nuclear weapons and that would be very dangerous because again all it takes is one mistake for things to go boom it's one thing when you're talking about two regimes when the years half of the USSR in the United States and we were basically the only nuclear powers then you know that that was hard enough to keep us from going boom right we had things like the Cuban Missile Crisis during the six-day war in 1967 there were serious nuclear threats that were issued by the Soviets with regard to the Middle East so it was very tenuous even between two powers one of which was good one which was evil but both of which were rational in terms of self-preservation what happens if you have a regime that is that is really tenuous and that feels that it's only method of defense is a nuclear weapon and everybody else is proliferating so that's danger number one danger number two is you can see a world in which the North Koreans start to pursue more aggressive action attempt to ratchet up pressure on the world to give them concessions and so they start destroying South Korean boats right they started threatening Jeff Japan firing missiles in Japan every so often and basically saying listen what you're going to do about it your taxes will move somebody using that as their deterrent not in order to calm the waters but in order to royal waters that's the danger in North Korea but is the danger immediate nuclear war no I don't think the danger is immediate nuclear war so everybody ought to you know stop thinking that their Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2 where they're grabbing a chain-link fence is the blast wave hits them and rips their skin away from their body I don't think that's what's about to happen here but by the same token the military option certainly should not be off the table because things are only going to get worse not better with North Korea I think everybody who's assuming that this regime is just going to magically collapse I guess it Soviet Union collapsed because Mikhail Gorbachev made a vast miscalculation with regard to modernization he felt okay if we modernize if we open our doors a little bit if we do glass not the Soviet Union will survive instead everyone who could opt out of the system opted out of the system the Kim regime is not going to make the same mistake they're going to keep this thing locked down as long as humanly possible Kim Jong moon is a very young man and that means that he is going to be around for quite a while unfortunately barring some sort of miracle that takes him out you know you hate to pray for God to kill people but if God's going to take somebody let him take him jung-geun a guy's a piece of human debris and the entire family needs to be deposed but he is a in my age right he's 33 years old in fact he was born a week before I was so it's you know he's young guy it could be around for another 50 years so the idea that this is on the verge of collapse is just not true and that's why it's such a dangerous situation now because the dangerous situation you would assume that the Democrats should for just a second put aside their animus for president Trump and start talking instead about supporting a basic American stance on this which is that North Korea has to calm that stuff down or we're going to be forced into taking action in North Korea the negotiation should be taking place that when Trump says things he does have the credible threat of force behind him and instead Democrats have decided it's more important to shame president Trump we'll talk about that in just a second but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at the u.s. ECA so in it is an amazing story guy named Devin Hopkins woke during the night to a stranger banging on the side of his house trying to break into his basement he was fearing for his life so Devin got a gun confronted the burglar aimed low to shoot a man in the leg now fast forward a year he's now being charged with aggravated assault and careless use of a firearm and apparently he was sentenced in July 2016 for defending himself in his own home the burglar has yet to be charged the world is not fair just because you're defending yourself in your own home just because you're defending yourself from home intruders that doesn't mean that the police aren't going to come and arrest you and you might not be prosecuted and that's why you need to work with the UFC CA the UFC CA wants to protect hardworking Americans who are trying to defend themselves and their families that's why they're there to educate train ensure responsibly armed citizens before during and after a self-defense incident no one should go through the aftermath of a self-defense incident alone and the u.s. CCA is making sure you can defend yourself they're giving a gun away every day to show appreciation and support for our Second Amendment rights for information about their life-saving coverage visit defend my family now calm today let's defend my family now calm again they'll make sure that if you that you're educated for when to pull the trigger or how to pull the trigger you can go - to defend my family now calm right now and register for the possibility of winning a gun they're giving away a gun every day you can do all of that plus if God forbid you have to use your gun in a self defense scenario then they will help you ensure that you are legally covered and you don't either go bankrupt or spend the rest of your life in court or jail that's what the u.s. CCA is there for so go over and check out defend my family now calm ok so naturally Trump is saying all this stuff and the media is trying to make it out that he's a crazy person who's going to get us into nuclear war not happening and the Democrats are trying to suggest that Trump is actually the bad guy so Democratic Representative named Juan Castro he is is is this Whovian Castro one I know that they won and who lien on our twins so this one is Joaquin sorry Joaquin Castro so who lien and Joaquin are brothers and Joaquin was arguing that North Korea is just getting more more threatening because of Trump not because they threatened and they've been threatening consistently for my entire lifetime but because of Trump I mean this is just this is working in bad faith for Democrats it really is here is here's Castro well the first thing is that I think some of these threats have been made because the president has also made his own threats and so that's why I'm saying that we need to allow diplomacy a chance to work instead of going tit-for-tat with 32 year old dictator in North Korea okay diplomacy is working in fact there their reports today that diplomacy is is moving forward that the Trump administration has had contact for months with the North Koreans and that we are moving toward some sort of defusing of the situation but the idea that you're going to go on national TV and you're going to undercut the credible use of military force with regard to South Korea with regard to North Korea is a very dangerous notion Maxine Waters doing the same thing again Maxine Waters has been proclaiming for months the Trump will be impeached or Trump applause or something will happen that will get Trump out of there through some democratic created miracle she says that Trump is bluffing okay again this is bad stuff you never want to say that the President of the United States is bluffing when Obama drew his red line in Syria there were those of us who said it's stupid to draw the red line if you're bluffing but it was not a good thing if we were out there saying he's definitely bluffing you don't want to you don't want to show enemy regimes that you think the President of the United States is full of it because it means that they're credible use of threat that they're credible threat for use of force is gone how do you deter if people think that you're completely full of it here's Maxine water has to however whose top priority is not preventing North Korea from getting aggressive her top priority is instead trying to humiliate president Trump I believe that North Korea is interesting threat to the United States but I think there are some things that they want from us and we have to find out whether or not we can work with them on the things that they're asking for and so this is something that we should be very concerned about but this is not the time to go bluffing and threatening it's a good time for diplomacy okay so you know whenever Democrats say it's time for diplomacy diplomacy involves the credible threat of use of force and that's half of diplomacy the whole idea of diplomacy is supposedly the iron fist inside the velvet glove and you either get the velvet glove or get the fist if there is no credible threat then why engage in diplomacy in the first place I mean if of Koreans no we're not going to do anything then why wouldn't they just continue to develop their nuclear weapons and threaten whomever they want and fire nuclear weapons at whomever they choose there has to be a credible threat of force Democrat Street diplomacy it's a pet peeve of mine they treat diplomacy as those diplomacy is an actual is an actual policy instead of diplomacy being a strategy toward the achievements of policy there is a difference okay a policy is something that you are attempting to forward obviously you would prefer to promise you to force if they achieve the same end but if they don't achieve the same end then you have to determine is diplomacy better or a force better diplomacy is a strategy it's like you know I'm going to fight with my wife right I have a couple of strategies as to how I can defuse the situation okay the goal is not the strategy the goal is to defuse the situation maybe to defuse the situation I need to give her space maybe to defuse the situation I need to hug her and talk but those are strategies towards defusing the situation the goal of the situation isn't for me to have alone time the goal of the situation isn't for me to grab a hug no Maxine Waters and Democrats they treat diplomacy as though the goal of the situation is to talk with North Korea chorus spend their time talking with North Korea the purpose of talking with North Korea is to achieve some sort of settlement where we're not on the verge of nuclear war every five seconds with a nutcase who lives there that's the purpose of all of this you know one of my pet peeves here is also Ben Rhodes who just needs to go away and shut up Ben Rhodes the the idiot national security adviser under President Obama his great national security experience before that had been being a failed novelist with with he'd written some half a novel that was never published and it's really he is the author of the egregious and horrifying Iran deal and he's tweeting out about this stuff he should shut up because the bottom line is that we're going to be in the same situation with Iran in about five minutes here because you signed a nuclear deal with the Iranians that allows them to pursue a nuclear weapon the minute they say they have developed a nuclear weapon then all of a sudden we're going to get always because Trump undermines a nuclear deal that's why all this happened no the reason this happened is because Iran was pursuing a nuclear weapon the Obama administration chose to ignore it in favor of trying to make overtures one of the most evil regimes on the planet exactly is the Clinton administration did during the 1990s you know Ben Rhodes he said he's tweeting out now Trump turned to national security was inevitable given domestic failures and constraints but this week doesn't bode well for next three so now this is a distraction remind me again who was it who is threatening Guam oh yeah I was the North Koreans remind me who was it who was reported to have built a nuclear weapon that can fit on the tip of an ICBM that's right it was North Korea but the Democrats hate Trump so much that everything everything is Trump's fault and then you've got and then you've got Ben Rhodes tweeting about how it is how we can't back out of the Iran deal because if we back out of the Iran deal then it's just terrible he says this is a key point any chance of a deal with North Korea goes out the window if Trump cancels a nuclear deal that Iran is complying with then maybe you shouldn't have signed a bad nuclear deal with Iran handing them that's handing them the store opening the grocery store the Democrats keep signing bad deals then they're shocked when everybody takes advantage of the bad deals that is far more of a problem than people trying to enforce deals and trying to ensure that that places don't go nuclear and threaten others it's really quite amazing I mean that the delusion of the Democrats is insane he says that you know they're ripping on Trump because it's tweet about military solutions and locked and loaded he says are we coordinating with our allies listen I am sure that our military is coordinating with our allies Trump says stuff everybody knows Trump says stuff so I'm highly doubtful that were in the midst of a nuclear war here but this is what Democrats want you to believe so that you're scared of President Trump okay meanwhile there's been some hubbub about Trump staffing decisions with regard to national security and this is indeed a problem you want to present the united face when it comes to your national security team Trump's governing by chaos is not useful when it comes to national security so you've got open battles now between Steve Anand from chief strategist and HR McMaster Trump's national security adviser McMaster has ousted a bunch of Bandhan loyalists inside the administration some of whom should have been ousted some of whom probably should not have announced it McMaster is an expert on on counterinsurgency his perspective on Afghanistan is apparently one of the things at issue with with Steve ban and bandages wants to get out of Afghanistan may master is saying guys al Qaeda is still there if we get out of there there will be another terrorist attack we ought to be staffing up not staffing down in Afghanistan Dannan is arguing the reverse that fight is causing Bannon to feel marginalized and lash out at at McMaster there's man's Laurie dr. McMaster McMaster is not particularly pro-israel which i think is a problem obviously but Trump is the president and if he can check McMaster on Israel and then listen to his advice on Afghanistan that seems to me probably a better strategy Trump has been forced to come out yesterday for example and say that he has confidence in his own national security adviser this does not provide the sort of face to the world that you want what you want when it comes to foreign policy is United Front where people know that whatever you say is credible that there are not arguments among your members of your administration publicly you don't want members of your administration arguing with each other that creates confusion and it leads America's enemies to sit around thinking okay what do they really think what do they really want so here was Trump being forced to to testify to the greatness of McMaster you have all confidence and your national security adviser yes I do gentlemen bastok absolutely he's our friend he's my friend and he's a very talented then I like him and I respect him okay so you know he's sticking with me master for now the the right is very upset with McMaster because all the purges of the a lot of the Mandan people and the feeling that may master is more of a traditional defense guy who's willing to work with Obama holdovers all of that is Trump's call all of its Trump's call I keep hearing from people he got a trust Trump fine trust from it is called time for him to get his poop and order the same thing is happening with regard to Sebastian Gorka Sebastian gorica is one of the national security advisors important policy adviser to President Trump it seems like his main job is to go on TV and say stuff the Trump likes Sebastian Gork I've met him I think once it seems like a nice guy I think is pretty knowledgeable about world events but you know he and Rex Tillerson from some Secretary of State are going at it because Tillerson is saying don't worry about the militaristic rhetoric we're working on something and Gorka is out there saying Tillerson is it safe he doesn't get to talk about what defense department is doing and so now Gorka is under fire for going to war with Tillerson sebastian you know this is going to be all over the papers and whether you had the exact meaning that people have now interpreted as it looks like to some people it looks like forget backstabbing that you front stab the Secretary of State and you know people look at that say who was he to admonish any process that the Secretary of State would take he's cam picked by the president I was admonishing the journalist of the fake news industrial complex who are forcing our chief diplomat into a position where they are demanding he makes the military case for action when that is not the mandate of the Secretary of State that's why we have a department defense if a journalist doesn't know the difference between we so Gorica tries to turn on the media but again from needs to get his team under control you would hope that John Kelly would help him with this but obviously Kelly is not able to get everything under control as of yet and that is a that is not a good thing okay so before we get to things I like and things I hate that I want to spend some ample time on the mailbag first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at policy genius so

because I would like to leave ample time for the mailbag today so we'll go right to things I like so today's thing is I like another book on North Korea I think people should be educated about this state the book is called the impossible state by Victor cha and it is a history of North Korea it looks back at what it was it looks forward to what's going to happen there it talks about its level of stability what comes after if the Kim family should basically lose power whether there is in fact some sort of internal turmoil it's very difficult to tell North Korea sort of a black box and so the reporting on North Korea tends to be a little bit of a haphazard because they don't allow foreign journalists in but this book is quite a good look at North Korea how it operates and why it has the problems that it has the impossible State North Korea past and future by a Victor cha you can go check that out okay other things that I like so Barack Obama is coming back so this is exciting he's going to campaign for the Democrats I could not be more excited about this Democrats are so screwed that they are trying to bring back the ghost of Christmas past so bringing back the president who awesome a thousand seats in state houses across the country twelve governorships ten in Senate seats 63 House seats that's the guy that they are trying to restore to the leadership of the Democratic Party the guy who created a coalition so fragile that even Hillary Clinton couldn't mobilize it in her own favor to defeat a reality TV TV game show host and Obama is back apparently he's going to help them fundraise hahaha the Democrats are have raised apparently half the funding that Republicans have since the election cycle which is amazing and he is apparently also going to help the politicians out by speaking that is not going to work for them so congratulations to Democrats you have hit on yet again one of the world's worst strategies so that is just excellent other news that other news that I like it's not really news that I like but I do like when reality when reality takes him so here is the piece of news by Amanda prestige Jacomo she is one of the our favorite writers over at daily wire a woman who enlisted to become the first ever female Navy SEAL quit after one week of training one week of training to the report from the Washington Examiner the unidentified female candidate dropped out in early August during a three week course in San Diego that began July 24th it was the first assessment of potential seal officers before they can be sent on to more grueling courses according to the website which said multiple Naval Special Warfare command sources so before January 2016 women were not allowed in military combat roles there were no female applicants in the 18 months since that historic change until July which is when this woman enlisted she lasted for one week she lasted from one week okay so the fact that that that she signed up listen anybody who signs up is doing more than I have so I can't criticize them on that basis but the stupidity of a left that suggests that women are exactly the same as men in every way is demonstrated every single day by reality by the way this is one of the reasons I think this movie atomic blonde is failing we were discussing this before the show Mathis in Austin Austin saw the movie he thinks it's really good I haven't seen yet so I really have no opinion on the quality of the film apparently it has a 20-minute fight sequence that's really amazing I have a general problem with female fight sequences where you get one woman beating up guys who are 200 pounds which is 105 pounds soaking wet and beating the crap out of guys who are 200 pounds as I know know in boxing we have weight classes right if there's a 10 pound difference between two boxers they're in different weight classes you think that doesn't apply to a 75 80 pound difference between men and women like come on gang come on so that I think that's one of the reasons why the female action star genre hasn't been doing particularly well there been a bunch of movies that have come out recently with the female action star and they just don't work that well typically because the suspension of disbelief to watch some beautiful woman the size of my wife throw around some six foot three dude who's who weighs 240 pounds it requires a certain suspension of disbelief I think also the marketing for that film it seemed to make a lot of the lesbian relationship in the film and I think that that's a mistake for the marketers not just because people are some people are put off by that but also because it is this is a question I asked Austin I asked in the film is there a reason the Charlie's Tehran's character had to be a woman instead of a man is there anything about her character in the film that makes her necessarily female in any in any real way other than the fact that she's a female in Austin no right she's seducing a woman in the same way that James Bond would seduce a woman so what is the what is the relevance of her being woman if she's a female action star but she's basically just a dude who's a lady then what have you gained from this like the best written female action stars think of Terminator 2 Linda Hamilton's character is really well written because her entire motivating feature is trying to care for her child trying to make sure that John is safe right that's the entire motivation of her character if you think of other great action movies where a woman is put in a position of peril often she's given a motivation that is more typically feminine than you know basically she could be James Bond and I think that's a good thing I think that people that there's something that doesn't ring authentic about women who just could be men on-screen or men who could just be women on-screen you know that men and women are different and we pick up on that and films lack authenticity when they don't when they don't play into that I think so that's not sexism that's just the reality of men and women being different which I understand is something we're not allowed to talk about anymore I get all of that okay so other things okay so you know let's do some things that I hate so I think the president Trump needs to shut up about Russia and the reason I think he needs to shut up about Russia every time he opens his mouth he just gives fodder to the Democratic side now I still see no evidence that Trump colluded with Russia in this election cycle I see evidence that his son Donald from jr. attempted to collude with Russia but that is not evidence of collusion the person who is most closely tied with Russia in the Trump campaign was poem Anna for Paul Manafort was his chief campaign staff he was the head of its campaign for three months and he was rated by the FBI apparently in the last couple of months Trump was asked about Manta Ford and the raid on him by the FBI and here was Trump's and here was Trump's statement to do that early in the morning whether or not it was appropriate you'd have to ask them I've always found Paul Manafort to be a very decent man and he's like a lot of other people probably makes consultant fees from all over the place who knows I don't know but I thought that was a very pretty tough stuff mr. president to wake him up perhaps his family was there I think that's pretty tough stuff okay the reason that he should not say stuff like this is because literally a week and a half ago he was on tape talking to police officers and saying when there is a criminal don't put your hand on the top of their head if you have to rough them up a little bit go ahead right now he's talking about its really tough stuff that Paul Manafort got woken up in the middle of the night it's not a good look okay not a good look like that's not the problem here what he should say is if he thinks mana for Tennyson he should say poor man afford is innocent if he doesn't think he's innocent he should shut up but doing this whole he's a victim of the system routine it just doesn't wash and especially doesn't help that every time Russia does something bad Trump seems to feel the need to defend them in some weird way so Vladimir Putin kicked out 755 diplomats out of the US Embassy in in Moscow apparently and here was Trump's response to that no I want to thank him because we're trying to cut down a zero and as far as I'm concerned I'm very thankful that he let go of a large number of people because now we have a smaller payroll there's no real reason for them to go back so I greatly appreciate the fact that they've been able to cut our payroll for the United States it will save a lot of money sort of half joking there but I'm not sure what that joke is supposed to mean considering that all of these people are still employed by the offended State so it's not really true shouldn't he say you know that's inappropriate like they're a bunch of people who just were kicked out of their homes out of their living quarters kicked out of the country shouldn't get some points say that's bad wait I'm sorry they saving us a lot of money for it all it's not even technically true and second of all time in a good joke so I'm not sure what exactly he's trying to accomplish from all of that okay other things that I hate Kathleen rice is a is a Congress Democratic congresswoman she's very angry because the NRA and Dana lash I'm kind of series of the ads the ads are very kind of tough in tone and tenor they're not my favorite ads I love Dana dan is wonderful I don't think this is a dinner I don't mean as the best use of Dana I think Dan is a wonderfully charming person a very warm and inviting personality and I think the ads have have become very kind of growly so they're not my favorite thing in the world but this is insane okay so Kathleen Rice's Democratic Representative she says I'm just going to say it okay first of all on Twitter whenever and in life whenever you say I'm just going to say it it's usually followed by something you really should have thought more about saying correct because I'm just going to say it NRA and Dana lash are quickly becoming domestic security threats under President Trump we can't ignore that the message purity threats are you crazy I mean the answer is yes you are crazy I mean that's a crazy statement domestic security threats your domestic security threat when you suggest that Americans ought to be armed in case of in case of violence that Americans ought to be arms in order to protect themselves from home invasion like exercising their second Amendment rights that's what the NRA is for and when Dana lash points out that it's a threatening world out there they're a domestic security threat no wonder Republicans say the Democrats are fascists when they issue stuff like this once you label someone a domestic security threat that leads to a justification for shutting them down that's utterly utterly not a final thing that I hate then we'll do some mail back so final thing that I hate here is ABC shoot political analyst again in Matthew Dowd he sweet that dumb stuff about religion all the time he used to be a Bush 2004 campaign chief strategist about a month ago he tweeted out that he was Catholic he said being Christian is a state of being practicing lourve some of the most Christian folks I know in life are atheists and every Christian went wait wait hold up a second is what like being a nice person being a Christian are not identical right they're not quite the same thing some of the most Christian people that he knows are not atheists because like I'm a very nice person to my employees despite me making fun of them a lot I'm very nice guy with my family I'm generally a nice person tries to gun away for others I am NOT a Christian I am a Jew right I mean like there's certain set of beliefs you have to engage in okay that wasn't even the worst so yesterday he tweets out quote a fundamentalist radical Christian is just as misguided and frightening as a fundamentalist radical Muslim no difference um no okay if I see a guy in the park shouting Jesus Saves I just runs into the park holding a briefcase any shouts Jesus Saves I think to myself okay you know what I'm gonna like probably you know like shy away from him but not really that afraid that maybe he's willing to blow himself up however if he runs into the park carrying a briefcase and he shouts Allahu Akbar then my reaction will be slightly different and that's for a reason that's because the vast majority of bombings worldwide vast majority terrorist bombings worldwide are being carried out by radical Muslim fundamentalists okay tens of thousands of people dead every year thanks to radical Muslim fundamentalism twenty four percent of Americans believe that the Bible is literal inerrant Word of God and there's another 47 who believe that it's inspired by God so the vast majority of Americans are at least religious to that extent and and a quarter of Americans are religious fundamentalists according to Matthew Dowd and yet we don't see Christians going around and raiding games raping and looting and blowing people up but this is the stupidity of the media that's looking for moral equivalence wherever it can find it okay so let's do some of the mailbag now all right Jesus has been put top five Halloween October movies though okay so how will we move to I have to admit I'm not a scary movie fan scary movies are not my thing they tend to be kind of off-putting to me if I if I were forced into it I would say The Shining is in my top five mmm this is I'm not a psycho fan and the reason being that the first two-thirds of it is great then though the ending is so weird like last ten minutes of it is so men didn't die I'm having a hard time coming up with movies that I think are really scary that are good that are not sci-fi like for example I really like 10 Cloverfield Lane but I don't think that counts as a horror movie even though maybe it should right it's sort of a quasi horror film I like lock box movies the ones where it's like the two people in the quittin enclosed space and they sort of have to deal with it but that's but not my favorite thing so instead of answering your question I'm going to answer a question I'm making up on my own because it occurred on Twitter yesterday and that was top 5 action movies so I separate action from adventure which is why my list is a little bit different from other people's lists so I don't include movies like Indiana Jones and my top 5 action movies because it's more of an adventure movie adventure to me is characterized by going to kind of exotic places and engaging in period combat you know like like Adventures of Robin Hood but my top 5 action films are and let me see if I can find the list that I made if my list was die hard Terminator 2 the fugitive the Bourne Identity and taken so taken makes a list I know a lot of people disagree with this there are there are some other action movies that I think are close up on the list I'm particularly like some people gladiator gladiators not an action movie to make it's it's it's a it's a historical epic it's not not really as much of an action film for me if no one fires in an automatic weapon at any point in the film then oh then it's probably not an action movie unless they're a bunch of great action set-pieces like a train trying to run you over like in the fugitive it's amazing how the fugitive is sort of been forgotten but it's so eminently watchable if you're flipping around TV and the fugitive is on then the chances are that you're going to end up watching at least fifteen minutes of it but diehard obviously top of the list I heart is just an amazingly good film the script is so good the key to a great film period is that the villain has to be fantastic and each one of these films the villain is is really good or at least the the situation is really compelling so die hard the villain is one of the greatest villains in film history Hans Gruber is one of the best villains ever Terminator 2 Robert Patrick playing the kind of puddle of metal that can morph in the t1000 it's just it's spectacular the fugitive is great performing Tommy Lee Jones won Best Supporting Actor Oscar for a Bourne Identity has some of the great action scenes in film history and taken I love taken I got to admit I think taken is an amazing action film taken is it's it's becoming so iconic that now everybody is that now everybody is you know makes up lines from it you know the I have a particular set of skills that I mean look it up should an entire new career in for Liam Neeson being like this old tough guy who beats people up Liam Neeson also happens to be one of my favorite actors so there's that like one of the great tragedies of gangs of New York is that they take him and murder him in the first 15 minutes of the film it's like I have to watch three hours of Leonardo DiCaprio versus Daniel day-lewis when I could have watched three hours of Liam Neeson versus Daniel day-lewis would that have been a better film what if they made it what if they made Leonardo DiCaprio the we like his father like reversed the casting and Liam Neeson young Liam Neeson versus Daniel day-lewis for the rest of that film so much better like we Mason just makes stuff better dark man is not a good movie but it's a good movie because Liam Neeson is in it it's Liam Neeson is awesome they have to stop killing him in the first 10 minutes of every film there's like a thousand films where Liam Neeson gets killed in the first 15 minutes is stupid stop doing that people it's annoying like even in silence he's the best thing in silence he's in silence for like 10 minutes and it's fantastic by the way good movie silence I actually I think the best Scorsese film is silence okay Eric says hey Ben how much can you bench so I am I know that sounds geeky I'm more of a CrossFit guy than and then a benchpress guy because I'm not looking to gain bulk I'm long and lean I'm just a massive coiled tension and muscle the last time I tried to do any sort of benching I think I topped out around like 215 so not huge amounts of weight but I benched it I think six times so I don't know what my top my top bench is but I'm not like I'm not a bodybuilder or weight lifter I can say that I can pump out a hundred push-ups pretty easily and I can pump out 30 pull-ups pretty easily you know that all the sort of active stuff that I've flipped lots of tires and hit things with with hammers and such and I can do the and I'm very proud of this I can do the Navy the American Ninja Warrior thing where they have like the pegboard where there's a board they take the pegs and they climb up the board using the pegs I can do that as well so that's kind of fun Alexandra says hey Ben what is a good non-religious argument against issues like euthanasia and assisted suicide Thanks so I've told people this is an issue where I am split when it comes to the legality of euthanasia and assisted suicide what I have a problem with regard to euthanasia and assisted suicide is making doctors into modes of death dispensation where do you draw the line all right so some people say okay well for terminal patients euthanasia that's the strongest case but just like abortion that's like using rape and incest to justify the whole thing what about somebody who just has depression right now I think the statistics are like one in 200 people in the Netherlands is put to death through euthanasia I don't want doctors to be trained in in depth you actually get a market for that then right you get a market in doctors who dispense death at the lowest available prescription rate and I think that a society that forwards dealing in death is is likely to start taking life less seriously plus you could have a lot of malfeasance I mean you could see a situation in which family members are pressuring an older member of the family to just get it over with that they can take the inheritance or somebody has Alzheimer's and the family just decides okay put them out of their misery I think it's it's a bit of a slippery slope euthanasia that's that's the secular argument Dakota says does the Bill of Rights apply to the state if so are any of California's new gun laws in violation of the Second Amendment so great question the Bill of Rights originally did not apply to the states it is only about the federal government because it is a federal document over the course of time the Supreme Court gradually did what they call the incorporation doctrine we're in order to apply a lot of the elements of the of the Constitution to southern states particularly that were violating those provisions of the Constitution with regard to their black population the the Supreme Court started using the fifth and fourteenth amendments the due process clause to try and suggest that states were bound by the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause to enforce all of the other elements of the Constitution that seems bad constitutional ah to me the First Amendment actually does not apply I mean the person in the wording of the First Amendment obviously doesn't apply to the states right says Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech right Congress Congress a federal institution I don't know how you apply that to the states but now that's been legally applied to the states it applies so if you were to apply the Second Amendment to the the people of California then yes California's gun laws almost universally violate the Second Amendment to the Constitution Tyler says hey Ben do you think legalizing medical marijuana on the federal level would help combat the opioid epidemic also do you think Big Pharma would lobby against this so Tyler I haven't seen evidence that the that marijuana present in particular states has lowered effects of the opioid epidemic so if you could show me evidence of that then I'd be all in favor of that I'm in favor of legalizing marijuana on the federal level anyway because I don't think that the federal government has done a good job of policing it what that said I think that it is it is worth noting that the high apparently that you get from marijuana is not even close to the high that you get from opioids and opioids are significantly more addictive the evidence on marijuana addictiveness is mixed at best the evidence on opioid addictiveness is extraordinarily strong maybe next week we'll talk a little bit more more about President Trump's decision to to declare the opioid epidemic a national emergency I'm not sure what the federal government can do here the bottom line with the opioid epidemic is spraying from two particular sources one influx of heroin from down south across the Mexican border to the the over-prescription of drugs like vicodin and oxycontin that started in the in the 1990s and 2000's and so people would have an injury and then they would go get oxycontin they'd be basically using what is a soft form of heroin and then they would go out and seek a further high actually one of the things the federal government did was exacerbate this because people who are on Medicaid could go a bottle of pills that was working like $1,000 about t code on buy it for $3 and then sell it on the open market in order to make some money while at the same time addicting themselves there's a lot to talk about with regard to the opioid epidemic but you know it is it is a several pronged problem one is enforcement of the border two is we need to ensure that doctors stopped over prescribing this medication and three there's a natural spiritual problem among young Americans right now or searching for meaning and filling it with drugs and that's a serious issue Kelly says if you were to ask a question for the mailbag what would it be well it would be Ben why don't they double your salary that would probably be and my answer would be I don't know I'm the boss I should do that shouldn't I Tyler says hey Ben I don't like sports I don't drink I'm 22 how on earth am I supposed to have a social life I find it hard to have friends and most of my peers have totally different priorities I'm generally a social guy and by no means an introvert but I have almost no interest in what most people my age care about I imagine this is a rather common problem with young conservatives how would you advise people like me deal with the Salama so you know I think that listen when I was in college I was not world's most social animal when I was in law school I also don't drink not out of principle because I'll have a drink every so often but because as some bad acid reflux so it doesn't doesn't do it does a job on me but a number I do like sports I can talk about that but I think that there's always America's a huge place with lots of people live there with varying interests obviously we have a huge audience here at the Ben Shapiro show and that means there are lots of people who think like you if you listen to the show and want to talk about issues like this because they spend time every day listening to this content if you're interested in politics politics is a conversation starter and you should be able to find people who are willing to talk about deep issues by the way when you're dating that is the stuff that you should talk about are the deep issues my you know my wife our first before our first state was legitimately three our conversation about free will and determinism not joking we've married now for almost ten years we have two beautiful children and we are an extraordinarily happy couple Jackson says hey Ben the Jewish faith teach that some sins are worse than others also does it teach that they're unforgivable sin so Judaism says that some sins are more serious than others obviously there's a different level of punishment for different levels of sins murder is a more serious crime than eating not kosher for example and I think any religion that suggests that all sins are equally as egregious is not a religion worth listening to because obviously that's not true Judaism does say that you can't impute to God your own justification for a particular sin so it's up to God to decide which ones are more severe but yes there are levels of severity when it comes to sin as evidenced by the different punishments um you can bring a sacrifice for some you die for right as far as unforgivable sins so I believe that they say the unforgivable sins in Judaism and forgive me if I get this wrong and for other Orthodox Jews will write me if I do but the unforgivable sins in the sense that you must pay for them are adultery idolatry and murder I believe are the three Biggie's so if you do those three than any of those three than those are essentially unforgivable Jackson says what's your beef with Michael Knowles I don't have a beef with Michael Knowles I my vehicle with Michael Knowles is where is the beef I mean that's my peoples Michael Knowles you wrote an empty book and sold 120,000 copies of it that's my beef with Michael Knowles and come on come on again Chris says I did not wait for marriage I'm not proud of this I'm at the point in my life where I want to get married what is the best way to address my pass with my girlfriend possible fiance well first of all I mean I think that you should just say that I think that you should say exactly what you say here you didn't wait for marriage you wish that you had you want to bring up your children so they do that and I think repentance is a wonderful thing I think that you realizing that you made a mistake and that you wish you hadn't that's okay you know we all make mistakes in life you know being honest about your past and suggesting that you've gotten beyond it is the best way for your potential spouse to know that you're capable of that sort of thing which is really important in Genesis Ben what is your honest take on stay-at-home moms do you believe college educated women who choose this lifestyle have wasted their education thank you no I don't think that they've wasted their education at all I think that whatever choice you make to be at home with your kids is a good choice and the balance that you choose to make between career and being at home is your choice I think that you know women who choose not to be at home with their kids at all have a serious problem it's why one of the reasons my wife is working the way she's working is because she is hoping that when she's done she's able to create a much better work/life balance and if she didn't go through a couple of years of poop to get to the to the roses and as my grandmother used to say sometimes you have to walk through the poop to get to the roses and the manure to get to the roses and I think that's what a lot of you know the educational process is all about but no I think that you know stay-at-home moms are doing something that is is vital I mean you can see that there been a tremendous impact on children who don't have parents around as much thanks to things like divorce it is not a rip on working women but everybody has to balance out how much time is necessary with your kids and how much time is necessary in the workplace and there's this idea that you can have it all no you can't have it all you can have a lot of most things and this is not a case against women in the workplace either okay a couple of more questions and then we'll go Kelly says with Google and the memo being a hot topic in the news this week I was wondering what is your belief the rule should or should not play if a business is discriminating and hiring and/or paying employees my belief is that the government should pay no role in this because of a business discriminate in hiring than they are losing money because the idea is of discrimination inherently is that you're going to avoid hiring the best person for particular job and you're going to hire instead somebody else which means somebody else is going to hire the best person to make more money than you and if you don't pay employees that well then you are going to be able to then that person can go across the street free markets tend to get rid of discrimination not for everybody but over the course of time I'm going to try and read this backwards oh no that's it okay so okay so so Malthus is going to fix this because otherwise I'm literally reading a email live backwards and upside down okay it's loading there we go Bunbury you're fond of saying students shouldn't sacrifice their grades to make their argument for conservatism after the google memo is clear not even safe after school what can we do well again I think that there is there's something to be said for the Google memo guy we had on yesterday just in the sense that he has now raised the raise the consciousness of the country with regard to the sort of discrimination that's happening at Google so that's a calculated decision you have to decide whether you think you're going to do the most good by fighting the power where you stand or by you know staying in the closet is conservative until you have more power and I think that that changes situation by situation but I don't think that it's worthwhile always granting a baton to the bad guys in order to make a point because sometimes that point does not go over or is worth less okay so we will be back here next week with all the latest news thanks so much for everything that you do for the show we really appreciate it again we are the number two podcast in America after Oprah and and if we continue to grow then we will overtake Oprah Oprah the lenda s and and we will eventually take that top slide on iTunes which would be pretty awesome so we will see you next week have a wonderful weekend I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show
