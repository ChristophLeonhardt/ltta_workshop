He was a warrior,
he was a prisoner,
he was a hero,
he was a congressman,
he was a senator,
he was a nominee for president
of the United States.
We gather here to
mourn the passing
of American greatness.
The real thing,
not cheap rhetoric
from men who will never
come near the sacrifice
he gave so willingly.
Nor the opportunistic
appropriation of those
who live lives 
of comfort and privilege,
while he suffered and served.
The America of John McCain
has no need to be
made great again,
because America
was always great.
He was honorable,
always recognizing
that his opponents were still
patriots and human beings.
He loved freedom with
the passion of a man who
knew its absence.
He respected the dignity
inherent in every life.
A dignity that does
not stop at borders
and cannot be
erased by dictators.
John believed in
honest argument
and hearing other views.
He understood that
if we get in the habit
of bending the truth
to suit political
expediency or party orthodoxy
our democracy will not work.
That’s why he was willing to
buck his own party at times,
occasionally work across the aisle
on campaign finance reform 
and immigration reform.
That’s why he championed a
free and independent press
as vital to our
democratic debate.
