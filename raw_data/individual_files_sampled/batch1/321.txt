a show of diplomatic commitment in Vancouver to ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program but the meeting co-hosted by Canada and the United States yielded just one new tactic for the fight an agreement to prevent so-called ship-to-ship transfers of outlawed goods to Pyongyang I think we all agreed together with our partners here that the timing has turned out to be really fortuitous because we are seeing we we want to be clear-headed we don't want to be in any way pollyannas about this but I think we collectively believe that the peaceful pressure is beginning to have an impact North Koreans know our channels are open and they know where to find us but a sustained cessation of North Korea's threatening behavior is necessary is a necessary indicator or whether the regime is truly ready to pursue a peaceful diplomatic resolution to the security threat that it has created our nations must remain united on sustaining pressure until North Korea takes concrete steps toward and ultimately reaches denuclearization Russia and China were excluded from the meeting only countries that it supported Seoul during the Korean War were invited to the gathering Moscow and Beijing said this one-sided event could aggravate tensions however two of North Korea's neighbors said now was a good time as any to tell Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear ambitions we should not be naive about their intent nor should we be blinded by North Korea's term offensive in short it is not the time to ease pressure or to reword North Korea we stand ready to provide a brighter future for North Korea if it makes the right choice analysts said the Vancouver meeting won't be a major venue for resolving the North Korea question but it isn't a waste of time either if the clouds can part just a wee bit with a little bit of sunshine coming in then those countries are going to be necessary whether it's to talk about verification whether it's to talk about new forms of economic assistance to North Korea that could be part of the opening process the US and Canada have promised to brief China and Russia on the discussions held here on Tuesday it's not clear whether this gathering will have turned out to be instrumental or simply a sidebar to diplomatic efforts at the UN Rosalind Jordan al-jazeera Vancouver
