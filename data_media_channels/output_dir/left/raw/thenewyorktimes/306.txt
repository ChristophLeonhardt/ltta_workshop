1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,850
I sit in these classrooms every day.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,470
So it’s just like, how can
something happen like this?

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,680
It was like, about 20 minutes
before school was supposed to end.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,020
I think it’s just kind of crazy

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,830
how fast it happened.

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,850
It didn't really seem real
as it was going on.

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,100
I just have this sick
feeling in my gut

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,870
that all that had to happen.

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,625
And it's starting to feel
more and more real.

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,940
It’s really different when
you see something in the news

11
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,080
and rather than seeing
it happen at your school.

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,850
Because it happened somewhere
so close to home

13
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,650
that it became
more of a reality for me.

14
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,620
I’m all for freedom,
but there’s a difference

15
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,920
between freedom
and being safe.

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,770
This shouldn't happen to
anyone else.

17
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,320
Like, this has to be the last,
or one of the last,

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,390
school shootings
in the United States.

19
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,740
I want everyone to come
together and put differences

20
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,530
aside and realize that we need
to do something about this,

21
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,080
because kids are dying.

22
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,000
I am upset.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,190
But I’m like, using that to
talk about gun control

24
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,650
and to talk about what happened.

25
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,060
We should get the word out,
speak our minds, because that’s

26
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,920
pretty much all we have
at this point is our words and ...

27
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,340
People always say
things after shootings.

28
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,840
They talk about gun
control and they

29
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,980
talk about how things
need to change.

30
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,000
But nothing ever does and
that’s what’s so frustrating.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,670
I want them to stop
saying that they’re

32
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,830
giving us their
prayers because that’s not

33
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,030
going to do anything for us.

34
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,170
We need action.

35
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,070
It’s time to put
petty things aside

36
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,070
about partisanship

37
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,090
and it’s time to think
about humanity.

38
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,250
People are just expecting
to see it on the news.

39
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,180
And we should not expect this.

40
00:02:07,180 --> 00:00:00,000
This should not be normal.
