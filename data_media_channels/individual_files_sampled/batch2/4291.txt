while this terrible new series of terrible new series of the man in the high castle plays out in our real lives now and we await this next Putin visit well we are also still waiting for some other shoes to drop with some of the legal cases around the Russian attack and the question of American cooperation and coke conspiring with that attack and and some of what we're waiting for is fairly straightforward obviously the felony criminal trial of the president's campaign chair Paul Manafort is due to start in less than a week now potential jurors are expected to show up at the courthouse in the Eastern District of Virginia for the Paul Manafort case starting on Tuesday also in the gru case that bombshell indictment of 12 Russian military intelligence agents we don't expect those Russian military intelligence agents to turn up anytime soon but we are waiting sort of some knock on revelations that we expect to derive from that indictment for example that indictment of all those Russian military intelligence officers also says bluntly on or about August 15 2016 the conspirators posing as deucey 42.0 meaning the Russian military intelligence guys received a request for stolen documents from a candidate for the US Congress the conspirators responded and sent the candidate stolen documents related to the candidates opponent based on the timing this means this was a general election congressional candidate in 2016 who solicited and received stolen information on his or her opponent from Russian military intelligence ahead of the 2016 election that American congressional candidate who may or may not now be a serving member of Congress hasn't yet been named but based on this part of the indictment clearly that is somebody who is known to the Justice Department and so we're waiting for that shoe to drop whenever the Justice Department chooses to drop it then there's also the unnamed American who plays a starring if somewhat romantically tragic role in the Maria bootie Necaise Maria patina is the only Russian who's been indicted in the Russia scandal thus far who's actually been arrested and is being held in US custody we expect to see her back in court in a few days since her indictment the Washington Post has added some further reporting about us person one who was essentially described as a co-conspirator with her in that indictment she's charged in that indictment with operating essentially as a secret agent of the Russian Federation in this country now us person one has been identified in multiple news reports but not by law enforcement multiple news reports say he is Paul Erickson who's a conservative political activist with a long history in Republican politics it was described in court yesterday by by Maria boo Tina's defense lawyer as Maria boo Tina's boyfriend that said prosecutors have alleged in their court filings that it might not actually be true love that they have documentation that indicates that at least from the tina's perspective their personal relationship they're living together was not a sincere love affair it was something she was doing some resentfully as part of her covert influence operation for the Russian government well according to the Washington Post's reporting on Eric's a non-us person one check this out Erickson lobbied for a role in Trump's transition team and complained after the election when he ran into a problem with his security clearance since we know now he was sleeping with the Russian spy I'm kind of happy about the Russian I'm kind of happy about the security clearance process in that case just as on the side anyway quote even without official credentials though Erickson pressed Trump donors and former campaign officials pushing for top positions for other people one person recalled his lobbying to get katie mcfarland named as an advisor to michael Flynn Trump's first national security adviser Michael flame so again this is us person one a person who is named in this latest indictment in the Russia scandal as cohabitating with and essentially being a co-conspirator with this accused Russian secret agent who's now being held in jail awaiting trial in Washington according to the Washington Post's reporting this guy who was very personally involved in her and potentially in on her scheme he recommended that the new deputy national security adviser should be Katie mcFarland that was an unusual choice katie mcfarland had been involved in Republican politics she had worked in earlier Republican white houses but when I say earlier I mean like way way way earlier and since then she's been an occasional contributor to Fox News but she's been barely on the periphery of even weird trumpian national security politics not not a not a not a high-profile figure not a heavyweight figure by any stretch of the imagination but nevertheless after recommendations in part from Maria boo Tina's fake boyfriend katie mcfarland was elevated to a very high-level job in the Trump White House deputy national security adviser essentially runs the national security process inside the White House it's the operations officer who runs the whole national security council and runs intelligence through the national security process it's the National Security Council has hundreds of people being deputy national security advisors the kind of job where you work 30 hours a day katie mcfarland always seemed like an odd fit for that job but nevertheless they gave her that job we now know in part on the recommendation of maria boo Tina's boyfriend she did not last long in that job though katie mcfarland left in the backwash after national security advisor Mike Flynn was fired a month into the new administration and then he was later criminally charged in conjunction with the Moller investigation related to his contacts with the russian government okay so this prize opened a whole new thing email you remember how the Flint disaster unfolded right just a few days after the Trump inauguration not even a week into the new administration Flynn was interviewed by the FBI at the White House about contacts he'd had with the Russian government two days after that FBI interview the acting Attorney General of the United States Sally Yates called the White House counsel's office and expressed with some urgency that there was a matter of serious national security concern that she needed to discuss in person with the White House Counsel she went in person to the White House she met with the White House Counsel in a secured office space and she delivered to the White House Counsel the Justice Department serious concerns about Mike Flynn related to his contacts with the Russian government and most urgently the Justice Department's belief that he while serving in that incredibly sensitive job with access to the highest classified information in the US government the Justice Department believed he was actually at that moment compromised by the Russian government Russian government had leverage over him that they could potentially use to compel him to do take your pick hand over secrets take action against the national security interest of the United States I mean whatever the Russians might want him to do they had leverage on him he was compromised Sally Yates goes to the White House counsel's office with that urgent warning and even to this day we still do not have very much clarity about why they then kept him on his national security adviser for another 18 days it's been 18 months since then we still don't know why they did in Sally Yates later explained both in testimony to the Senate and in public interviews that that she was somewhat flummoxed by that White House decision to keep him on we was very concerned about the underlying conduct and went through and explained to the compromised situation with the Russians and told him specifically that we were giving in this information so that they could act we felt like there was a national security threat absolutely you have no doubt about that I don't think anybody in the end the Intel community has a doubt about that you wanted the White House tact absolutely yes to do so we expected the White House - did you expect them to act quickly yes there was urgency - to the information yes do you think Michael Flynn should have been fired whether he's fired or not as a decision for the president the United States to make but doesn't seem like that's a person who should be sitting in the National Security Advisor position if you hadn't been fired if you were still in your position and you hadn't seen any action over the course of that 18 days was there more your role as the acting Attorney General would have permitted you to do oh I would have gone back to the White House if you were still the acting Attorney General you would have gone back to the White House I wouldn't be knocking on the door again yes why because I would have been concerned that we had a national security adviser who was compromised I would have been able to control what happened but I would have gone back to him what sort of questions would you've asked mmm what have you done it's been a mystery all along clearly somewhat frustrating mystery - Sally eighths herself all along why the White House didn't act for more than two weeks after this very urgent national security threat was brought to their attention but now 18 months later right another part of this is unfolding in December we learned that despite assurances from the White House that Mike Flynn had acted alone now his contacts with the Russian government had been the act of sort of a rogue official nobody else knew what he was doing we learned in December that in fact he hadn't acted alone his deputy katie mcfarland had known about Flint's secret contacts with the Russian government before during and after those contacts happened she'd helped set him up these are the same contacts with the Russian government that he pled guilty to lying to the FBI about katie mcfarland would also later lie about her knowledge of Flynn's contact with the Russian government when she was questioned about it by the US Senate one of the weird long tales of this story that is that after she got out stood as deputy national security adviser following the Flyn debacle the Trump administration actually for a while tried to name her an ambassador as part of the confirmation process for her would be ambassador ship she appears to have lied to the US Senate and denied any knowledge of Flynn's contact with the Russian government her emails from the transition show in fact she knew about those contacts she was in on it Flynn was not acting alone Flynn was not even alone in lying about those contacts with the Russian government katie mcfarland did it too and now as of now based on this new reporting from the washington post we know that US person 1 reportedly paul erickson marie abou Tina's fake boyfriend who prosecutors say she was romantically involved with as part of her slur as part of her covert operation to serve as an agent of the Russian government in this country Mateen 'as Maria booty knows just for the sake of spying boyfriend according to the Washington Post he's the one who recommended katie mcfarland for that job in the first place which is a job you really might have not ever expected her to get Sally Yates was acting Attorney General when she tried to warn the White House with urgency about a senior a fish in the Trump White House being compromised by the Russian government she was driven by the urgency of needing to get that official out of there because of the danger that represented to our country the White House we know at the time didn't see it that same way how does it change that story how does it affect our understanding of that lack of urgency in the part of the Trump White House to now know that Flynn wasn't alone that Flynn's deception around this issue was not on something in which he was acting alone and at least obliquely there appears to be a connection to an illegal Russian influence operation which the Justice Department apparently just broke up with this new indictment Sally Yates is the first person from whom we Americans got the news about people at the highest level in this Trump administration being compromised by the Russian government while they served as US officials today that warning has a whole new resonance Sally Yates joins us for the interview next hey there I'm Chris Hayes from
