hey guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so it's a new year new you</font>

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,230
right if you went out on New Year's Eve

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,520
you've now recovered from your New

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,080
Year's hangover and if you didn't go out

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,580
you've recovered from your Netflix

6
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,230
hangover although over here in London

7
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,670
were in the middle of a rainstorm the

8
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,349
sun is out intermittently<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you might</font>

9
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:15,150
even have a cheeky<font color="#CCCCCC"> Christmas check from</font>

10
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,590
one of your relatives but there's an

11
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,810
implied expectation of failure in<font color="#CCCCCC"> year's</font>

12
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,789
resolutions it's still really cold in

13
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:22,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a little bit broke because</font>

14
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,850
Christmas was really tough from the bank

15
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,140
account best thing there is to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> while</font>

16
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,760
your energy is still a little bit higher

17
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,470
and you're still feeling pretty rested

18
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,720
make yourself a really good place to

19
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,090
start January and get it<font color="#CCCCCC"> going and to</font>

20
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,070
start the<font color="#CCCCCC"> year off right ever playlist</font>

21
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,829
that i called the 2013-2014 crossover

22
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,660
playlist i'm not quite sure why because

23
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">i didn't really play it in 2013 but so</font>

24
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,860
far and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fairness it's only january</font>

25
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">third it's been really nice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to just put</font>

26
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,129
my laptop on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> side so we're turn the</font>

27
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:48,870
brightness down select<font color="#E5E5E5"> the playlist or</font>

28
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:49,950
the other way around because you don't

29
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,059
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to select the playlist while it's</font>

30
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:52,890
dark and just play music without having

31
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,719
any visuals again clear up my room which

32
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,219
has been my big project for then also

33
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:57,989
get stuff ready for things like taxes

34
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:00,180
and like make lists and write goals and

35
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,879
just kind of have a really like present

36
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,260
time where you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not being a little bit</font>

37
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">caught up in the virtual world like I</font>

38
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,350
love the virtual world and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will defend</font>

39
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,760
it to the death<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially when people</font>

40
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,780
are criticizing it and that's why I

41
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,189
really love the Apple advert that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

42
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:12,299
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that boy who was secretly</font>

43
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,100
making a film about his family do you

44
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,330
think it's nice to just kind of rest

45
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,740
your eyes from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for a little</font>

46
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,360
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes enjoy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that can</font>

47
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,310
come out of the computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not really</font>

48
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,049
one for silence I find silence a bit

49
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,000
like oh I don't I don't like it people

50
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,900
told me oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to become</font>

51
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,100
comfortable in silence and I'm

52
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">comfortable i just don't really enjoy</font>

53
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,920
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do enjoys having a really great</font>

54
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,450
energizing playlist that will drive me

55
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">through the rest of the month and even</font>

56
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,240
the rest of the year and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what kind of</font>

57
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,829
harness the best of all this restful

58
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,270
most that I have going on the other

59
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,500
thing I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really enjoying is the fact</font>

60
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,119
that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people are around have a</font>

61
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,890
little more time still to meet up people

62
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,180
who I don't normally<font color="#E5E5E5"> see who are around</font>

63
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,159
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Christmas and just generally friends</font>

64
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">who still have a little bit time of work</font>

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,619
my friends will came over the other

66
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,030
night to watch Charlotte I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

69
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,259
around I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can end this by telling you</font>

70
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,210
some of the songs that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are on my 2013</font>

71
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,430
2014 crossover playlist a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

bastille or in fact anything by bastille

76
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,049
