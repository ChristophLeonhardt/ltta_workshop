the day in which the Senate Judiciary Committee after at long last interviewed kristinb lazy Ford who is the first accuser against Brett Kavanaugh now to stop for just a second before we actually get into the accusations that kristinb lazy Ford made we should recognize that there been a number of allegations have been made and I want to go through them this is the one that matters kristinb lazy Fords is the one that matters because it is the most credible and it's the most credible because it is the one that that rings the truest there's still questions about it and this is the problem for Republicans from the very outset it was unclear what Republicans were attempting to argue about these allegations were they arguing that kristinb lazy Ford was lying I for one never argued that kristinb lazy Ford was lying I always believed that she sort of believed what she believed she'd come forward with these allegations before at Cavanaugh was even selected for the Supreme Court when he was just on the shortlist and there's evidence that she had talked about it back in 2012 I was never somebody who suggested a christine Blasi Ford was lying I questioned whether her memories might not have been correct because memories change over 30 years I questioned whether more importantly the evidence was sufficient to knock Brett Kavanaugh out and this was always the big question the big question to me was is an allegation alone no matter how credible without any corroborating evidence whatsoever is that enough to stop a nomination that's really the question because no matter how credible witness is it's going to be he said she said if they're the only people in the room and in this particular case christine Blasi Ford had suggested there were other people at a party when she was 15 and Brett Kavanaugh was 17 she says that at that party Cavanaugh and his friend Mark judge forced her into a room turned up the music and Cavanaugh forced her onto a bed where he attempted to take off her clothes and then placed his hand over her mouth when she tried to scream there's no other witness that has verified this count mark judge has denied it I think he should be subpoenaed but mark judge denied it Brett Kavanaugh denied it she says there were other people at the party we'll get into her specific allegations in a moment including one of her close friends who has denied that she was at any party where's Brett Kavanaugh so there is no corroborating evidence we don't know date we don't know location we don't know time we don't know how she got there so even if she is telling the absolute truth there is no way to actually corroborate any of her story the reason that matters is because this was happening in a quasi public setting there should be some corroborating detail if you look at situations involving Bill Cosby or Harvey Weinstein there are ways that you can corroborate at least that people are telling the story at the time as I mentioned on the show when I was in high school I I've said 15 but I believe I was actually 13 or 14 because it was my sophomore year of high school when I was in high school I was abused by some kids in my class I remember where it was I remember who the kids were and I should be able to lock down the date if I just look at a yearbook or look back at a calendar and I can find people to corroborate the story there's no corroborating evidence here and Blasi Ford has been unable to really corroborate any of that now does that mean she's lying no it doesn't mean she's lying it doesn't mean she's lying at all and so what this comes down to is is the allegation itself enough if you believe the allegation itself is enough all that mattered today from the hearing is that Blasi Ford was emotional when she spoke about this because she obviously experienced a trauma and Experian Payne both of which I believe by the way I believe that she did experience some trauma and she is experiencing pain I don't doubt any of that but the question becomes without any other corroborating evidence is that enough and so that's just made today basically a sort of public assessment of her performance was her performance credible was her performance believable was her performance emotional which is kind of gross I mean that is kind of gross the fact that the public question was going to come down to how well could this alleged attempted rape victim tell her story because in that sense if she had been more robotic would we not have believed her if she'd come off a little bit less collected would we not have believed her if she had not come across emotional would we not have believed her and those are uncomfortable questions but that's why Republicans never should have gotten into this line of questioning in the first place the question all we should have been listen even if we believe your story there's no corroborating evidence and we have a denial on the other side that means that there is some burden of proof to come forward with some form of corroborating evidence and he just haven't supplied that because Republicans didn't do that the hearing turned into his christine Blasi Ford a credible witness is she a believable witness and what you'll see is a lot of folks on the right saying she's not credible she's not believable because her memory was skewed in other areas but her contention and I think it's not a completely unfair contention is well I may not have remembered the actual date of this happening but I certainly remember the feeling and being pushed down on a bed having a guy jump on top of me put his hand over her mouth and I remember his face that's not that's not in an incredible suggestion it's not not incredible and that's that's relatively credible when bad things happen in your life you remember the specific bad thing that happened in your life you don't necessarily remember well the surrounding circumstances the problem is there's no way for us to adjudicate whether her memory is faulty or not because there's no corroborating evidence okay so that's Christine Blasi Ford I wanted to mention these other allegations to demonstrate that not every allegation necessarily ought to be believed just on the basis of the allegation so Debra Martinez I've said in a piece in The New Yorker earlier this week on Sunday The New Yorker reported that Martinez had alleged that Kavanagh thrust his penis in her face at a frat party at which he was drinking while he was at Yale University but the New Yorker piece is extraordinarily weak according to the publication she was hesitant to speak publicly because quote her memories contained gaps because she had been drinking at the time of the alleged incident and she was quote-unquote reluctant to characterize Cavanaugh's role in the alleged incident with certainty so even she says that she didn't know what happened this particular accuser only after and the direct quote from The New Yorker six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorneys that she decided to come forward no corroborating witnesses have come forward then yesterday there's an accusation made by Julie sweat Nick who's a woman brought forward by Michael avenatti the lawyer for stormy Daniels and 2020 Democratic candidate for president and according to her sworn declaration she saw Kavanaugh get drunk in high school and then groped girls against their will as well as spiking punch with quaaludes and alcohol and participating in a gang rape line at multiple parties that's her description sweat Nick says she went to approximately ten parties at which such events took place so his Debora Ramirez not Martinez sweat Nick says she went to ten parties at which such activities took place she says she was the victim of such a gang rape but is unclear in her declaration whether Kavanagh participated a vinod he refuses to answer simple questions on her behalf he has not made her available to testify she says there are other witnesses but none have come forward so again in accusation with no corroborating evidence the New York Times put a kindly quote none of Miss sweat Nick's claims could be independently corroborated by the New York Times and her lawyer Michael avenatti declines make her available for an interview and then late on Wednesday afternoon a fourth allegation came for this was from NBC News reporting that the Senate Judiciary Committee was inquiring about another allegation of misconduct they reported that an anonymous woman said that her daughter's friend was physically assaulted by Kavanagh in a Washington DC area bar while he was drunk she said when they left the bar under the influence of alcohol they were all shocked when Kavanagh shoved her friend up against the wall very aggressively and sexually there were at least four witnesses including my daughter the daughter has not come forward the woman has not come forward none of the witnesses have come forward so another uncorroborated in this case anonymous allegation made against Brett Kavanaugh now maybe Kavanagh did some of this maybe he did none of this we don't know any of those questions what is certainly true is that there is not a court of law in the United States civil or criminal that would either convict or punish based on just the allegations alone there's no way to do that so is it in a country where there is due process it seems to me that an allegation alone should not be enough to support the destruction of a man's life and a man's career no matter how credible the person telling the story and this is what Republicans failed to say in the lead up to this hearing instead the narrative was put out there that maybe she was lying or maybe she was politically motivated but that was never the question we live in a system where due process actually matters and that due process doesn't necessarily apply in the court of public opinion but if we're gonna be intellectually honest about how we actually assess situations we have to have something beyond a mere allegation maybe it's that there are multiple allegations and all the allegations have similar elements is in the Bill Cosby or Harvey Weinstein cases maybe it's that there's corroborating evidence that some of this stuff happened as with Roy Moore but an allegation alone it seems to me is really weak sauce and if that had been the case nothing in the hearing with Christine Blasi formed have changed anything today nothing would have changed anything because not only did she not provide any corroborating evidence what she actually showed is that the only memory she seems to hold clearly is the actual incident itself with Cavanaugh everything else her memory seems particularly hazy and again that doesn't answer whether this happened or not and it doesn't even answer whether she is correctly remembering what happened with Cavanaugh or not what it is suggesting is that memory itself is variable and not only that it suggests that without any other corroborating evidence which he actually weakened today wrenchy weakens the possibility of corroborating evidence today should not strengthen the possibility of corroborating evidence nothing she said today brought additional evidence to the table it was just her telling her story in her words so you have to ask yourself what changed between yesterday and today last night she put forward her actual statement her statement was written it was very similar to what she had told the newspapers it's very similar to what she had said in a letter to Diane Feinstein and representative in California named and eschew none of that changed the only thing that changed is that we actually put a face to the accusation if that's the case then what we really had today was an emotional appeal and listen I felt the emotional appeal to because it's hard not to watch a woman who's experiencing pain that she attributes to a dire trauma right to an incident that any of us would have responded with fury to and say okay well that's that's now more credible but is it more credible because she said it out loud is it more as opposed to credible doesn't provide any level of objective verification of the events she speaks of because she set it out loud I don't think so I don't think so and if it does you have to ask yourself what exactly changed what exactly changed now this was a loss for Republicans and I'll explain why it was a loss for Republicans in just a second but first let's talk about your sleep quality there's nobody on the planet like you so why would you buy a generic mattress built for anyone else Hewlett sleep has built a sleep quiz that takes two minutes to complete they use the answers to match your

Democrats wanted out of the hearing was something very simple a binary she's lying or she's not lying that was the binary and Democrats said we believe her she's not lying and what they're hoping to do by that is suggest that anyone who didn't believe her was there for a sexist and doesn't believe doesn't believe women who are credible but that really wasn't the question again the question for this hearing should have been even if you believe she is not lying our allegations without any corroborating evidence whatsoever none zero zilch any corroborating evidence are those allegations enough to finish a guy's career that's how Republicans should have played this they should have said we don't know whether to believe her or not we may find her credible but we can't have a standard of evidence in this country where people are denied a career and a life based on unverifiable and unverified allegations from a vague time in the past where there should be public witnesses in there are not that's what Republicans should have been arguing instead they allowed Democrats to turn this into is she believable at her she's not and the answer is yeah she's believable there's nothing about her that suggests that she's not believable like listen to her tell her story so here is four she told her story and what you'll see is that Republicans had appointed a woman named Mitchell to who's a prosecutor to question her and and this woman basically went after the fact that Blasi Ford's memory has lots of holes in different places but Blasi for basically defeats all of those attempts with a simple statement which is I may not remember everything else in my life but I remember that time the guy jumped on top of me put his hand on my mouth and tried to rape me right that's all she had to say it takes everything else off the table if Republicans had said before that listen it sounds like what happened to you was awful but we have a guy over here who denies it you've provided no other evidence and then they'd asked her okay well you can't provide any other evidence can you help us can you help us establish another chain of evidence if Republicans had done that then maybe this turns into something else instead what it turned into is we're supposed to doubt her because of various questions about her her history of flying or were supposed to doubt her because she has not been completely forthcoming about her polygraph or stuff like that they're trying to kind of suggest that she is not inherently believable again it's hard to claim that an attempted rape account is false because she fibbed about her dislike for flying if in fact she flipped about her dislike for flying we'll get into all that in just a second here is what Ford talked about today I am here today not because I want to be I am terrified I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me well Brett Cavanaugh and I were in high school okay so she obviously is is pretty collected here and then she goes on to say that she believed that Cavanaugh was going to rape her I was pushed onto the bed and Brett got on top of me he began running his hands over my body and grinding into me I yelled hoping that someone downstairs might hear me and I tried to get away from him but his weight was heavy Brett groped me and tried to take off my clothes he had a hard time because he was very inebriated and because I was wearing a one-piece bathing suit underneath my clothing I believed he was going to rape me okay so obviously this is very affecting testimony there's no not to watch this and feel enormous sympathy for the person who's telling the story doesn't give you any corroborating detail no right and that's why how you frame the question matters an awful lot and this is why when when Ford actually got to being asked okay could you have mistaken Brett Kavanaugh for somebody else and she answered it was very bad for Republicans here are the two clips that really made the most they really made the most hash of Cavanaugh here is it clip 20 this is Ford talking about how she fully remembers all of this happening how are you so sure that it was he the same way that I'm sure that I'm talking to you right now is just basic memory functions and also just the level of norepinephrine and epinephrine in the brain that sort of as you know encodes that neurotransmitter encodes memories into the hippocampus and so the trauma related experience then is kind of locked there whereas other details kind of drift so what you were telling us is this could not be a case of mistaken identity absolutely not I can't guarantee that there weren't a few other people there but they are not in in my purview of my memory would it be fair to say there were at least four others yes okay okay so there's where she sort of changed her story but again it doesn't matter because the Republicans had not established what exactly they were trying to do there and this was part of the problem at the format so you see blazing Ford said listen it's imprinted on my memory that somebody tried to rape me and then she says all the other details were hazy and then when Republicans the the woman questioning is Rachel Mitchell who is this Republican Special Counsel when she pushes back and she says okay well what about the fact that you've now changed her story multiple times on how many people were at the party blazing Ford says right I don't remember that stuff so well because that's not when I was being raped right so she'd preempted the attack by essentially saying this is the only thing that I can remember really well and this is this is the problem and this was underscored by the next thing she said where she was asked specifically about what she remembers the most and this this is the quote that's gonna be played a thousand times tonight on on cable news indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter the laughte the uproarious laughter between the two and they're having fun at my expense in other words the object of the laughter I was you know underneath one of them that while the two left two front two friends having a really good time with one another okay so this opened a bunch of questions for Republicans none of which they were willing to take right they could have called mark judge to rebut that's the guy who she claims is in the room with Kavanagh he's already said under oath that he was not there for any of this and he doesn't know what any of this was but it would have been worthwhile to question him but here's the point what Republicans did with this hearing was a huge mistake because what they did is they basically brought in a special counsel to talk to this won't this accuser and then they split it up they had her ask a question for five minutes and then they let Democrats grandstand for five minutes and so there was never any line of continuity trying to establish what it was they were trying to establish what should have happened is you got Mitchell out there says listen whether we believe your story or not and you seem like a credible very nice person who suffered an awful trauma we need to try and find some detail we can corroborate here so that we can move forward with the seriousness of the allegations and so now I'm going to ask you a series of questions that are designed to elicit just that sort of corroboration and then at the end you say okay well if we couldn't find corroboration we can't find corroboration instead Republicans started asking questions that went to flaws in her memory but that don't undermine her central case meanwhile Democrats asked questions like how did it feel when a guy was trying to rape you who do you think is gonna win that PR battle because that's what this has become right I mean this is a PR battle this is not a question as to the truth or falsity of the allegations unfortunately Democrats are not interested in that Republicans don't seem particularly interested in that nobody's really interested in the truth or falsity because there's no way to find that out so this has become a political tool we'll get to more of this in just one second but first let's talk about making your company better well the best way to make our company better is to head over to zipper cruder calm you don't want the worst applications coming in you

now zip recruiters comm slash daily wire zip recruiter is indeed the smartest way to hire which is why we use it here at daily wire go check it out right now that powerful matching technology can make

and if they'd been trying also to establish the Democrats manipulated the process there are ways to do that cuz the truth is there were holes in Ford's testimony she was asked specifically for example what year did this take place because earlier she had said it took place sometime when I was in high school then she had narrowed it down to the specific summer and she never really gave an excuse as to why that happened she was specifically asked about whether she gave her psychiatrists records to the Washington Post for example because the first account that she had told of this story to someone not her husband was to her psychiatrist this sort of locked it into a timeline back in 2012 she's claimed medical privilege on those on those records she has not handed them over to the the actual Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee which would kind of be important because you'd want to see if there are discrepancies in her accounts of the events she hasn't handed those over but she did hand them to the Washington Post how do we know she handed them to the Washington Post we know she handed them to the Washington Post because it said so in the Washington Post story The Washington Post story explicitly said that she gave her psychiatrist records to the Washington Post but when she was asked about it suddenly she didn't remember which does raise questions about the capacity of her memory for example a full or partial set of those marriage therapy records to the Washington Post I don't remember I remember summarizing for her what they said so I'm not quite sure if I actually gave her the record okay so obviously she didn't give them the record is she miss remembering you don't know right speaking of miss remembering we were told last week that Christine Blasi Ford could not show up on Monday for a hearing because Christine Blasi Ford had a fear of flying this was a serious question because in the past week there been a bunch of nut more unverified allegations that have come forward that seemed timed by Democrats I mean it's just a giant coincidence that all these allegations come forward from Monday through Thursday and they all start breaking in the news this week well Blasi Ford's original claim or at least the claim of her lawyers is that she couldn't show up on Monday because number one shouldn't want to be questioned on that side of the country and number two she had a fear of flying well it turns out that her fear of flying has not prohibited her prohibited her soom she has a fear of flying but it hasn't stopped her from flying in what she considers important circumstances circumstances ranging from surf trips to visiting her family on the East Coast every year to coming in August to Maryland to I think to Delaware to to take a polygraph test so in other words she flies an awful lot and yet somehow she couldn't fly but then she did fly to get to this hearing she didn't take a car across the country she flew across the country well that raises questions about how Democrats have manipulated the timeline here and the person who's been done the most disservice by the Democrats is Blasi Ford she's been under tremendous disservice because let's say that she's telling the absolute 100% truth it looks manipulative no matter how this was played because Democrats weren't in fact manipulating the process Dianne Feinstein's did not come forward with the allegations for eight weeks and Feinstein's did not release it to the FBI Dianne Feinstein's did not question Cavanaugh about it either in public or in private the Democrats turned down a private hearing for Ford right the Republicans said you wanna do this behind closed doors let's do it there nope the Republicans said what if we send our representatives to you and question you out west nope instead they said she has to come East but she can't fly but then she turned out to fly rachel mitchell points this out that was certainly what I was hoping was to avoid having to get on an airplane but I eventually was able to get up the gumption with the help of some friends and get on the plane when you were here in the middle mid-atlantic area back in August end of July August how did you get here also by airplane I come here once the year during this summer to visit my family in fact you fly fairly frequently for your hobbies and your you've had to fly for your work is that true correct unfortunately so folks on the Left were mocking this like oh well who cares about her flight well it goes to the Democratic manipulation of the process because again we were told the Democrats just wanted to get down to facts but it turns out they were delaying the timeline for obviously political reasons all of which still does not go to the key point of this case and I get back to the key point of this case over and over again because I think it really is important not just for this nomination which is I'll explain what I think is gonna happen with it in just a second but it's also important because of what's going to happen with future nominations is it enough to have a credible allegation of something bad happening uncorroborated by uh fact of fact ok there's no corroborating fact here none none and this is it's not just me saying this by the way Jake Tapper even made this point on CNN last night that there's no real corroborating evidence for any of this because it turns out there's no corroborating evidence for any of this by not setting the standard Republicans really did Cavanagh a disservice and did themselves a serious to service Democrats are saying that Cavanaugh obviously should withdraw this in and of itself is sort of self-defeating I'm not sure why they think that he should like they're saying he should withdraw why not just call for there to be a vote right why don't why not just put Republicans on the record it seems to me that if Democrats really wanted to put Republicans feet to the fire they would say no he shouldn't withdraw make Republicans say whether they believe her or not that would be the smart political move I don't think President Trump is actually going to pull the nomination the reason I don't think Trump is going to pull the nomination is because president Trump tends to believe that accusations by women are very often he feels he's been victimized by such accusations in some cases he certainly has not been victimized by some accusations President Trump did a presser yesterday and here's what he had to say about the situation this of course was before the hearing but I've had a lot of false charges made against me really false charges I know friends that have had false charges people want Fame they want money they want whatever so when I see it I view it differently than somebody sitting home watching television where they say Oh judge Cavan or this or that so when you say does it affect me in terms of my thinking with respect to judge Kavanagh absolutely because I've had it many times okay the reason this is a giant fail is because this is president from falling directly into the trap that Democrats have set for him which is President Trump saying I've been accused falsely a lot of times therefore Cavanaugh has been accused falsely a lot of times except that there are a lot of allegations of President Trump engaging in really bad behavior with women sexually abusive behavior with women and president Trump was caught on tape lest we forget saying he grabs women by the genitals not the same thing as Brett Kavanaugh who maintains his complete innocence in all of this but this does set the mindset for the president to not believe any of this he doesn't believe it about himself and he also like I think that if you give President Trump a lie-detector test a polygraph really only detects stress it really detects whether you think you are lying it doesn't detect whether you are telling the truth but it's sex whether you might think you're lying and supposedly raises stress levels not particularly scientific if you hooked President Trump up to a lie detector to it to a polygraph machine my guess is that everything President Trump says would always pass the lie-detector test because he actually believes all the stuff that he says the problem is that he is now set it up is Ford lying or is she not well what this means is I don't think that Trump pulls Cavanaugh's nomination I think Trump leaves Cavanaugh's nomination no matter what happens and Kavanagh I can't imagine is gonna be able to row but the testimony right no matter how much sympathy he shows you can't rebut the testimony of a woman who claims that you were lying on top of her trying to rape her pretty difficult to rebut that I don't think Trump polls the nomination I think instead what happens is probably that Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine probably vote against Cavanaugh's nomination that kills the nomination Trump blames squish Republicans for finishing Kavanagh his bass is happy because he didn't pull the nomination any fights and by the way I don't think he should pull the nomination because again I think there should be a standard of corroborated of evidence that is presented if we're gonna start pulling nominations but I don't think Trump pulls the nomination I think he lets this thing go down and flaming defeat I think he nominates Amy Kony Barrett and then Democrats get what they want which is a referendum in November on whether Republicans should control the next Supreme Court seat if Republicans do not have a majority in November of the Senate there will be eight people on the Supreme Court from here until 2021 Democrats are not going to allow President Trump to fill the seat that's what this has always been about this is always for Democrats and I've got enough for Ford for Democrats this has always been about political manipulation for the press it's been about political manipulation as well there are too many members of the press who have treated allegations as verified facts there are too many members of the press who have treated evidence-free allegations as absolutely justified we're gonna get to all of that in just a second but first let's talk about your comfort with your underwear you may know that Tommy John as the creator's are the most

and and really I think is attempting to search for a better politics so good for him you know you can listen to that interview this week go check it out right now we are the largest fastest growing conservative podcast in the nation so the the treatment of the Democrats is really what's been egregious in all of this Republicans have basically said we will do whatever Ford wants in terms of having her here we are willing to hear allegations I will say that I think Republicans should have subpoenaed Marc judge I don't understand why they didn't subpoena Marc judge if they think that they are trying to get down to the fact but Democrats have been political with this since the beginning Dianne Feinstein was political with this since the beginning the media have been political about this too why well look at the way that they treated at least many in the media not everyone in the media look at how many in the media treated the Michael avenatti allegations from yesterday so an allegation comes forward a woman claims that Brett Kavanaugh was part of a gang rape gang back in high school she said there were tons of witnesses not a single witness comes forward she claims that she went to ten separate parties at which there were these gang rapes and drugging of women which does beg the question as to why would you go back I mean when's the last time you went to a party you saw a gang rape line and people drugging the punch and you're like you know what there's one of these next week I'm coming back I got to see whether it just goes differently next time and then do that 10 times it turns out by the way that the woman who makes the accusation was three years older than Brett Kavanaugh graduate in 1980 which suggests that she was actually a college woman like a full-grown woman going to high school parties watching gang rape lines happen and then saying nothing which is weird in and of itself but the way that many in the media treat this was a massive headline it was repeated over and over and over without a lot of these questions being asked I will point out one person who did ask the question CNN's Jake Tapper did grill Michael avenatti on this in avenatti obviously had no answers that by the way did not stop Dianne Feinstein from today in the hearing suggesting that there are three separate credible allegations against Cavanaugh which there are not there's one seriously credible allegation against Cavanaugh in my opinion that's Ford even that has no corroborating evidence the other two from Debra Ramirez and and from the the sweat neck I think that those are significantly less credible the least credible is sweat Nick for precisely the reasons Jake Tapper is about to show you I mean just to say he was present is is a really egregious lack of specificity when you're talking about charges this horrific and I'm not saying that I don't believe them I'm just saying what exactly are you saying or is she saying that he did Jake I disagree completely with what you just said let me be clear about something this is not my declaration these are statements by my clients these are her statement about what happened okay well that doesn't help at all and tapper of course is exactly right about all of this I should note on mark judge Republicans did interview mark judge Democrats refused to participate in the interview of mark judge that doesn't mean they shouldn't publicly subpoenaed mark judge I think that they probably should have but it turns out that a vanadis entire allegation from yesterday begins to fall apart a miami-dade count the scoring political a miami-dade County Court docket shows a petition for injunction against wet Nick was filed March 1st 2001 by her former boyfriend Richard Venice II who told POLITICO the two had dated for four years before they broke up thirteen days later the case was dismissed not long after an affidavit of non ability to advance fees was filed according to Venice II sweat Nick threatened him after they broke up and even after he got married to his current wife and had a child so he says this is a direct quote from her former boyfriend quote I know a lot about her she's not credible not at all didn't matter the media repeated this stuff and I will point out again there's some diversity in the media you have people like Jake Tapper who I think does try to be honest in this is why I respect Jake and then you have people like Don Lemon who really does not try very hard on CNN here's Don Lemon on CNN and saying that Brett Kavanaugh is like Bill Cosby based on he doesn't say right now a Supreme Court nominee faces two allegations of sexual assault or misconduct from his time in high school and his time in college back in the late 1980s Cavanaugh denies that they ever happen when Bill Cosby was initially accused many people for many years could not believe it the women's accounts were questioned took a very long time and a lot of investigating and multiple proceedings before there was a verdict as to the truth of what really happened okay so that is not helpful at all obviously there's no corroborating evidence but it doesn't matter he's just like Bill Cosby doesn't matter that Bill Cosby admitted openly to using quaaludes humpin Cavanaugh is exactly like that that's not just him obviously you've got Cady tour over at MSNBC who who did exactly what Democrats are apt to do which is just that anybody who doubts corroborating evidence says that the accusers are all liars again I'm not claiming tempura Ramirez is a liar I've not claimed in this entire show that or any other show that Christine Blasi Ford is lying I said there's not corroborating evidence why because facts don't care about your feelings on this one there is no corroborating evidence I feel terrible for these women as well corroborating evidence is necessary for you to buy an account you can't just buy an account because someone told you the account in just a second and play what Katy tur had to say to Cavanaugh's lawyer and then I'm going to show you other evidence of the media playing this as politically as humanly possible so Jeffrey Toobin on CNN he he is so well gets a tube in one second first let's do Katy tur so Katy tur was questioning Cavanaugh's lawyer about the Deborah Ramirez allegations and of course she doesn't ask her why do you doubt the why do you doubt the accusations and then the lawyer can say listen I don't know there to doubt the accusations or not I can tell you there's no corroborating evidence and instead it's why do you think she's lying I don't have to believe somebody is lying to suggest that their account may be faulty I don't have to believe that somebody is like this happens all the time in your daily life in your daily life with people you love they tell you stories and you think is that really how it went that's with people you love and my wife is sitting behind the camera today there are times when my wife will tell me something that happened and I'll say is that really how it went and then she'll say well more often she says this to me I'll tell her how something which is that really what you said and I'll think about it tomorrow I'll say now not exactly here's what I actually said right that sort of thing happens all the time with people you actually like I assume my wife likes me but it is a truth that you in order to have questions about somebody's account it doesn't require you think that they're lying per se but the media have decided to buy into the democratic binary either you believe the women wholeheartedly everything they say is verified truth without any doubts to memory or corroborate of evidence or you don't believe any of these women because you think that women are liars you believe the myth of Eve the liar bringing the Apple to her husband you you hate all women this is the the narrative of the Democrats and many members of the media been trying to promote here's Katie towards Wayne just that yesterday are you calling her a liar I'm not calling her a liar I think she has known about this for a while supposedly and so is mr. avenatti he waived this on some of your programs since last weekend and said he knew about it and he never went to the police as an attorney I know what my obligation is it's to my client and if I had represented her it would have been my duty to go to the police immediately but this is the question right the question is what mattered they're not the answer the question was are you saying she's lying if that's going to be the standard from now on it's gonna be impossible for anyone to escape any hearing unscathed ever because anyone can come forward with any allegation and then all you say is do you believe the woman is she lying are you saying women lie well we don't know whether somebody is lying or misremembering or telling the truth unless there's actual evidence you could have said the same thing about Toronto Brawley you could have said the same thing about crystal Mangum and the Duke Lacrosse case you could have said the same thing about Jackie from UVA you could have said the same thing about Emma Sokka wits at Columbia all those women it turns out we're not telling the truth I'm not saying any of these women are not telling the truth I'm just saying I don't know neither do you were you there unless you were and if you were you should probably come forward and testify I think but if you are not there you don't know you don't I don't know either my tendency is to believe Christine Blasi Ford's story but I don't have enough corroborating evidence to finish her guys career they simply on the allegation by the way I think there are a lot of folks on the Democratic side who would be more honest if they said the same thing about people like Juanita Broderick and we're running to Broderick accuse Bill Clinton of rape the answer the Democrats gave was she's not credible why what made her not incredible what they could have easily said is well her story is credible but there's not enough evidence for me to corroborate it which is the actual objective truth about things people tell you in real life but when it comes to politics we all suspend this when it comes to politics we all suspend the way that we normally work in the realm of the real in order to defend people we like or to target people that we dislike and for example here's so senator patty Murray she comes forward and again playing politics she says that anybody who claims that this is a smear campaign well that frightens me and what as a woman well it is a smear campaign by Democrats to bring forward a bunch of unverified allegations with no corroborating evidence there's no question that is but what patty Murray is doing is again drawing that crucial binary Democrats know they have a massive advantage right now with female voters a lot of that is driven by President Trump it really is look at the polls from 2012 to 2016 Republican law women in droves they've been losing women in droves ever since Democrats know that they can just plow a wedge between men and women on a voting basis if they can credibly accuse Republicans being sexist that's the game and patty Murray is playing it the message that this is a smear campaign frightens me as a woman that once again we are saying to women out there don't come forward you're gonna be accused of smear campaigns no one's gonna believe you stop do the investigation okay they are doing an investigation and then you yell at them for doing the investigation it's not just remember that the worst of all is of course Jim Acosta from CNN who's just a garbage heap I mean Jim Acosta is just just awful yesterday Jim Acosta asks President Trump at his presser why he doesn't call on a female reporter this is just the worst kind of grandstanding what difference does the question make whether it comes from a female reporter or a male reporter have you put the exact same words in somebody's mouth you should get the same exact answer is my opinion cuz I treat people as individuals according to a cost of though Trump won't call on female reporters cuz he's a sexist or something if you don't mind after I'm finished if we juror Halle or Vivian or one of our female colleagues could go after me that would be great this president just to follow up on these allegations against what happened what does he mean by that explain what what is what is that gonna be I think we greater foot if a female what does it mean what does it maybe right if a female reporter were to ask you a question about the this issue so if you don't mind I wouldn't mind that at all I wouldn't mind it at heart well let me uh wouldn't make any difference to me all right go ahead good for Trump okay that's the actual correct answer but you can see what Acosta's trying that's reported and that so much reporting so much journalism from Jim Acosta who loves him some Jim Acosta find you somebody who loves you like Jim Acosta loves Jim Acosta my goodness but that of course is the narrative that's being drawn okay so how does all this play out it probably plays out with Kavanaugh going down it probably plays out with Kavanaugh losing the vote or being withdrawn and then all hell breaking loose and Democrats proclaiming victory and Republicans proclaiming that they were stabbed in the back and things just get uglier because corroborating evidence doesn't matter and we're not honest enough to actually set a standard before beforehand as to what constitutes evidence that somebody's career should be finished okay time for some things I like and then some things that I hate so things that I like I'll remind you that when we say all women nobody actually believes we should believe all women nobody actually believes that because we have to actually look at each account on its face we have to determine whether somebody is telling the truth or not the way you do this is through corroborating evidence so I take for my example today the movie to kill a mockingbird the book To Kill a Mockingbird is of course one of the great books in the English language I think people always say what's the great American novel to me it's either Moby Dick or To Kill a Mockingbird the movie of tequila Mockingbird is it's a great movie although Gregory Peck cannot do a southern accent for his life but the score is really tremendous Elmer Bernstein's at the score just a beautiful beautiful square used to be the ringtone on my phone actually the score referred to Kill a Mockingbird but here is here's a little bit of the preview of to kill a mockingbird and then I will explain why this is relevant and now happily to kill a mockingbird becomes a motion picture and it's memorable characters come vividly alive that's God some people call it Jean Louise Finch but she insists on scout and that's her brother Jim just a boy until the day he learns there is evil in the world the score is great obviously I read Peck won Best Actor for his performance in this which again is weird cuz you didn't do a southern accent but in any case the movies great one of the reasons that I bring up this movie is because the movie is entirely about or at least the main part of the movie is about an actual false allegation of rape against a black man by a white woman who was actually sexually abused by her father and the way that the accusation is overridden in the court is not through a he-said she-said it's through corroborate of evidence it's through the fact that Tom Robinson who is the black man actually gets up and shows that he was not physically capable of hitting this woman on a particular side of her face because his arm is withered from a cotton gin accident from from his youth the point here is that evidence still matters okay due process still matters and whether I believe Christine Blasi Ford or not that is secondary to whether any standard is necessary in order for us to destroy somebody is any standard other than the alligator alligator esta fine that's the big question today that's the question nobody's going to ask and it's the question it's the only question that in the end really matters for the future of the country when it comes to nominations due process or any sort of trial in the court of public opinion okay time for a quick thing that I hate so the thing that I hate today Don Lemon of CNN again I've already hit Don Lemon earlier but he really he really outdid himself yesterday I don't know I don't know what he was on yesterday but it was it was solid stuff he was talking about Ted Cruz going to a restaurant in Washington DC and there he suggested that Ted Cruz so what happened is Ted Cruz goes to the restaurant a bunch of activists start yelling its head Cruz about Cavanaugh and he is forced to leave the restaurant with his wife here is Don Lemon explaining why this is totally cool I don't like it but it is one reason I'm not a public official that I'm not running for office in a way I think it goes with the territory I don't like it they were blocking his wife but that's what that's what he signed up for and as a strict constitutionalist which Ted Cruz is he knows that it's protected under the First Amendment again why it's not protected under the First Amendment to go into a private establishment and yell at people until they leave that is not protected under the First Amendment okay it isn't there's a lot of speech thank God in this country that's protected under the First Amendment I can't enter your place of business and just start screaming at you that is not actually protected by the First Amendment but Don Lemon saying that he signed up for this yeah I'm sure he'd feel exactly the same way if Republicans came and yelled at Don Lemon who by the way it's a major media figure did he sign up for this I don't think Don Lemon signed up for this I don't think I signed up for this I don't think Ted Cruz signed up for this I don't think Trump signed up for this I don't think Bill Clinton signed up for this I don't think people sign up for harassment in a law-abiding country I don't but according to Don Lemon apparently they do the other thing I have to say that I hate today jeet here is a an alleged journalist over at the Atlantic and he tweeted this out in the aftermath of some allegations that were that were dumped yesterday so Senate Republicans on the Judiciary Committee released a Cavanaugh investigative summary that included in an anonymous claim of rape forward by Kemal Harris's office that turned out to be complete nonsense two interviews in a written statement from a man who believes that he not Cavanagh actually was responsible for the assault and so jeet here tweeted out it's incredibly irresponsible to release this stuff a dump of raw gossip with only the intent of muddying the waters apparently are illegal over at the Atlantic what do you think the last several weeks have been okay this is raw gossip or personal accounts with the intent of muddying the water hay particularly this week put aside Blasi for two again has no corroboration for her statements this week we've seen several attempts at money in the water is coming from Michael avenatti coming from The New Yorker all of it uncorroborated all of it raw gossip intent at muddying the waters but apparently it only applies to one side of the aisle this is what's so irritating about all this none of this is really an attempt to get down to who should be on the Supreme Court or standards of proof none of this is really an attempt to get down to even the basic truth of what happened because there's no way to do that without corroborating evidence all of this is political and anybody who tells you difference is lying to your face and well we will be back here tomorrow with all of the fallout because I'm sure it will be magnificent in its horror we'll be
