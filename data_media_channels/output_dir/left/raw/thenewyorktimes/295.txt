00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,420
My name's Alex Garland, and I'm
the director of "Annihilation."

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,080
So here we have our five
scientists having just

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,190
arrived inside Area X, which
is this sealed off area

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,290
somewhere in a kind
of unspecified part

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,580
of coastal America.

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,060
And what they're finding
is strange plant forms

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,130
and strange lighting
effects, kind

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,590
of rainbow prismatic
effects in the sky.

9
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,350
And they're really, just â€”

10
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,680
This is their first
hours in this area,

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,810
and they're trying to
figure out what's going on

12
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,580
and what's happening here.

13
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,610
And what we're about
to do is introduce

14
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,550
a new element, which is
not lighting and plants,

15
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,750
but a creature, a rather sort
of gently mutated creature,

16
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,940
and they get more
extreme as we go in.

17
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,400
And this here is
just in my mind,

18
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,970
a very beautiful bit
of production design.

19
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,520
It's a good example about
how production designers

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,720
improve what is in a script.

21
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,110
"Anything interesting in there?"

22
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,610
"No.

23
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,254
It's been long abandoned,
maybe even before--"

[SCREAMS]

25
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,990
I'd written "EXTERIOR
FISHING HUT, DAY."

26
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,920
And Michelle Day, who is
one of the people who's

27
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,560
very responsible for
the look of this film,

28
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,590
found all sorts of
images of slightly

29
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:23,310
sort of cutesy ramshackle
fishing huts in Louisiana

30
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,320
and Florida, and
decided this was not

31
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,050
the right way for us to
go, and actually went out

32
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,420
and found this really
interesting sort

33
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,630
of trailer-like hut that was
half submerged in the swamp,

34
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,820
and it gave a completely
different vibe.

35
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:42,200
It was less sort of
picturesque and less cutesy.

36
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,730
And offset against this very
beautiful background of trees,

37
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:50,702
and Spanish moss,
and sunlight, I just

38
00:01:50,702 --> 00:01:52,160
thought it was a
very smart choice,

39
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,965
and it was very typical of
Miche that that's what she did.

40
00:01:54,965 --> 00:01:59,160
We actually shot this
just outside London

41
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,100
in an area of Parkland.

42
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,190
And most of what you see
there, in some respects,

43
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,030
is constructed.

44
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,820
There are trees
and there is water,

45
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,480
but the hut and really
a lot of the foliage,

46
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,020
the sort of spiky plants, and
grasses, and stuff like that

47
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,180
have been arranged
by the set dressers

48
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,120
to make this not look like
England, really, but look

49
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,930
like a sort of mutated version,
a sort of broken version,

50
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,906
maybe, of somewhere in coastal
southern North America.

51
00:02:29,906 --> 00:02:31,334
"Sheppard!

00:02:31,334 --> 00:02:32,286

[GROWLING]

55
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,850
And this becomes a
character beat, really,

56
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,450
about Natalie Portman's
character at this point, which

57
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,470
is the strange way she zones
in to this moment of violence.

58
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,120
As everyone else is backing
away from this creature,

59
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,220
she kind of leans into it
and has this slightly zen

60
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,810
experience as she kills it.
