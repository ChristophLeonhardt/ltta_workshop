politico with yet another article that is furthering establishment conventional wisdom Wow couldn't guess that so this is the oldest trick in the book and this is what they do every time and I they I don't mean Politico I've seen this a thousand times in the establishment press and they're back at it so the minute that progressives get any degree of strength or any wins and now we have the most popular politician in the country on our side that's Bernie Sanders they have to rip him down and they have to say hey progressives don't get any smart ideas the country is not going to go in your direction and the so-called objective media is going to help push out this idea for the Democratic establishment this is written by Alan Greenblatt so the title the pieces are Democrats headed for a McGovern Redux so this is the conventional wisdom that the establishment media puts out all the time two things they say that makes no sense and are completely antiquated you know all politics is local Tip O'Neill said that congratulations that you remember that quote that everyone else in the world uses and it's not remotely true all politics was locally when Tip O'Neill sent in the 1970s when everyone read their local newspapers and there was no internet all politics is not local now it is not remotely local that it's just a statement you say because you haven't actually analyzed anything and then this is what they say when it comes to progressive gaining any sure to remember recovered remember yes we all know that was 1972 that wasn't 45 years ago if you do the math it sounds like it's 45 no that was a million years ago when the country was completely different but nonetheless they say the party's presidential nominee the ultra liberal senator George McGovern of South Dakota went on to lose 49 states and one of the most lopsided victories in American history they said yes I know you remind me every single day every time that any progressive has any momentum look over and look over 1972 are you kidding now look to be fair to Greenblatt here he didn't have one quote that that at least acknowledges that it's a different country he said the white working-class caste nearly 3/4 of the vote back in 1972 notes the Philips founder of democracy in color and organization focused on race and politics now it's well below half so that is one of the things that makes it completely different than 1972 so when Nixon talked about the silent majority they were in fact a majority okay gee I wonder if that had something to do with winning all those lectures and in this article and in all these analysis they never talked about how govern watched his vice presidential pick and then that made a giant difference so they just say oh no he was liberal and people don't like liberals and so he mentions at the demographics what he doesn't mention is the polling and what the country actually thinks so don't worry guys I have that for you and I'm gonna share it with you because apparently the establishment press can't look up facts so I'm gonna help them okay so now he goes on to quote people that are part of the older generation of Democrats really oh my god don't ever run it liberal so here's Frederick log ball who apparently is a historian of sorts still stuck in Vietnam era he says if the Democrats moved to the left and focus on free tuition for college and single-payer health care I do get 1972 popping into my head that I mean look to be fair you're a historian your job is to cover ancient history and that's what you're doing but it's a totally different world but that's an easy way to panic people remembered I never do okay here's another guy Lawrence Jacobs same idea there was a radicalization going on within the Democratic Party that's a reaction to the last presidential election is being driven by a deep sense of aggrievement with regard to Republican behavior no we we were aggrieved way before Donald Trump won as Naomi Klein just told me in an interview I did earlier today he said if we go back to before Donald Trump which is what the Democratic establishment wants let's just go back to when times are normal know that that's when times were so bad we wound up electing Donald Trump that is not a positive time to go back to but it's not just based on that it is about reality that the establishment isn't rigging the system against the average American the minimum wage is $7.25 at the federal level that's insane it hasn't kept up with inflation and is kept up with anything and then you tell me because giant donors are putting money in and they'd like lower wages they'd like deregulation they's like lower taxes but you're telling me it's a coincidence that they get every single thing that they want and then you call it radicalization to say hey maybe we should live in a democracy where the voters matter instead of the donors by the way I'm not alone on this 93% of Americans think that the politicians represent their donors interests over their voters interests over nine in 10 Americans believe that we have that kind of fundamental corruption but not in Washington not if you're a reporter or a historian or political scientists they're all like oh that's radical radical to say that these guys are sellouts to work for donors and yes well you never see it on television now I'm gonna get to the numbers again in a second so bear with me as I give you one more maddening quote from the author here we said now this is him not he's not quoting anyone else he said consumed by interesting battles and the idea of opposition Democrats run the risk of again nominating someone like McGovern who pleases progressives but steers of course too far from the country's center of political gravity to win because if you live in Washington the political center of gravity is center-right and the right wing is right about everything and the Democrats if they have enough sense will bow their heads and listen to them now is that actually true no it's not remotely true so let me quote a number of polls for you expanding Social Security not cutting Social Security which is what the so-called moderates want to do in Washington know expanding Social Security is supported by 72% of Americans giant advantage they're raising taxes on the rich 52% of Americans supported they don't support cutting taxes they support raising taxes on the rich if you think that that is a radical position that you just call the majority of America's radical increase in military spending by cutting state and EPA funding nope Americans don't want it they'd rather have EPA funding and state funding rather than military spending they 58% opposed that that is a giant majority saying no I don't want more military spending I would rather have environmental spending but you'll never see that in a mainstream publication if CNN's polled they never even quote their own poll they mentioned it the first time it came out and then go on and have all their pundits just like political and everybody else go out and go oh no no the country loves defense spending country loves defense spending it's just not true but they say it anyway raising the minimum wage to $10.10 oh that's only supported by 66% of Americans only 26% oppose two-thirds of the country says for God's sake raise the minimum wage do you ever see that on TV you ever see that on Politico no they call that radical you're calling two-thirds of the country radical whose to actual radical my proposal is that the establishment in Washington whether it's the media or the Republicans or the Democratic establishment you are the true radicals because you represent a tiny tiny percentage of the country the donors that give money to those parties and the ones that also put ads in your publications and on your television sets where do you think all the political advertising goes to it goes to television cable news and a lot of these esteemed publications inside of Washington so their incentive eyes to call two-thirds of the country radical but in reality they represent that tiny percentage who want tax cuts for the rich even though the rest of them don't want it they want more defense contractors etc but I'm not done yet with the polls cuz we are right and you are wrong okay Medicare for all 60% supported that's radical 60 percent of the country supports it he just called it radical said that's not the center of gravity in the country well you're absolutely positively wrong on the numbers okay immigration reform 90 percent support pathway to citizenship according to CNN you get that sense when you turn on TV where you read Politico gay marriage 64 percent supported legalizing marijuana what gets laughed at in Washington 61 percent of the country supports it you are wrong and we are right not because we have different opinions we are right about where the center of the country is it's based on numbers it's based on statistics is based on science and now you will hilariously see the establishment press that are aggrieved by us pointing out facts turn around go appalling even though they use polling a thousand times ten hundred thousand times and they be yelled at Republicans sometimes that question opponent they will now turn around go Paul like you can't trust polling and you're just cherry pick cherry picking I just showed you almost every single issue here you cherry pick see if you can find polls that are different than the sieve you can find the average of polls on these issues we are right and you are wrong you are the radical you represent the tiny minority we represent the majority it is not 1972 it's the year 2017 and progresses will win and we will get an ideology that actually matches the true center of the country and I know you're never ever gonna write that because it's not that Allen green belts a bad guy of course not I don't want you to get the wrong idea or these political scientists they're not bad guys they're just inside their bubble and they can't see straight everyone I was just sitting watching it happens every time I go to watch it everyone in Washington thinks the establishment is awesome as things will always remain the same and anyone who doesn't agree that we should give all the money to defense contractors all the money the oil companies all the money to the banks and crush the wages and do all the other things anyone who doesn't believe that is a radical radical populist oh my god the countries with us and you wonder why politicians polls so low and why the media poll so low it is partly the Republican attacks of course you have to take that in their account but that's not the only thing they they sleep better at night by saying oh no it's unfair Republican attacks no the rest of the country does not have trust establishment press because they are correct because that press keeps lying to them over and over again telling them things that aren't true even though they are the exact opposite of what is true we're sick of it you think you're cute and you're fooling people the only person you're fooling honestly is yourself because they really do believe it in Washington they think that the country is center-right and then we'd all be better off we just did everything that the donors wanted well the rest of us are an open revolt to that we can't stand that anymore so who's right who's wrong we'll see you at the next election and all they're crying isn't going to prevent progressive primaries we're gonna primary the living hell out of them because this is what's killing the country we're not gonna let you get away with it anymore and this isn't 1972 we're gonna win Young Turks if you like this video you probably like
