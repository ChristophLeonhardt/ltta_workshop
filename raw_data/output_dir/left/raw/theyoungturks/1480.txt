1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:03,100
I DO WANT TO GIVE A RANDOM
SHOUT OUT HERE.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,630
WE DIDN'T GET TO IT ON ONE OF
THE STORIES WE WERE COVERING.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,800
MY SHOUT OUT IS TO JUDGE
NAPOLITANO ON FOX NEWS.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,690
HE HAS BEEN REALLY HONEST ABOUT
THE TRUMP COVERAGE.

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,539
LOW STANDARDS IN THE COUNTRY.

6
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:24,380
I WANT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT.

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,660
KEEPING HIM HONEST.

8
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,840
SOMEONE ON TELEVISION, ON
CABLE NEWS, FOX NEWS BEING

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,080
HONEST.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,410
SHEP HAS ALSO BEEN GREAT BUT HE
IS LIBERAL TO MODERATE.

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,360
NAPOLITANO IS VERY CONSERVATIVE.

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,260
I DON'T AGREE WITH HIM ON AN
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THE

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:50,110
CASES AND ISSUES BUT HIM TALKING
ABOUT HOW TRUMP CALLING THE FBI

14
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:55,760
INFORMANT A SPY, HE SAID IT WAS
A STUNNINGLY UNREMARKABLE EVENT.

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,220
IN ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT, HE IS A
JUDGE, YOU GET AN INFORMANT.

16
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,479
IT IS NOT A SPY.

17
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,700
HE SAID IT WAS THAT GIULIANI
TALKING ABOUT THE FBI AGENT WAS

18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,829
TRYING TO SOMEHOW DO A POLITICAL
SPY OPERATION ON TRUMP WAS AN

19
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:20,039
OUTLANDISH AND OUTRAGEOUS
ALLEGATIONS.

20
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:22,210
AND TRIMMED REALLY LIKED
NAPOLITANO BECAUSE HE ONLY

21
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,359
WATCHES TV.

22
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:24,909
NOT ANYMORE.

23
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:28,690
ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES HE WAS
ASKED ABOUT WHO HE WOULD

24
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,219
PICK FOR THE SUPREME COURT HE
SAID NAPOLITANO BECAUSE

25
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:32,669
THAT IS THE ONLY JUDGING YOU.

26
00:01:32,669 --> 00:01:34,919
WHAT ABOUT JUDGE JUDY Ã±

27
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:37,340
OR JUDGE WALTER.

28
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,850
IT COULD OF BEEN.

29
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:48,919
FOR A GUY TO CONTINUALLY
CRITICIZE HIM ON ALL THE THINGS

30
00:01:48,919 --> 00:01:52,869
HE THINKS HE'S WRONG ABOUT,
CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE.

31
00:01:52,869 --> 00:00:00,000
THESE ARE THE TIMES WE LIVE IN.
