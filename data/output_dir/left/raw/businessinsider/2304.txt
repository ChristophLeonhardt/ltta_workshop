surprisingly good for us our<font color="#CCCCCC"> company's a</font>

31
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:07,290
little different in some folks we are

32
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,899
majority display ad sales but we also

33
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:11,159
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a classified component to our</font>

34
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,560

board for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> restaurant industry for</font>

38
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,399
eater and we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at things to do</font>

39
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:21,689
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rackspace in the classified</font>

40
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,340
market<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like it because we're never</font>

41
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,409
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the kind of site that has 1</font>

42
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:27,359
billion page views or 1 billion visitors

43
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,469
we're a little more locally focused

44
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:30,630
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a little more niche so</font>

45
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,100
the classified business for us gives us

46
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,530
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to you know build a second</font>

47
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">business right alongside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to display ad</font>

48
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,710
business your sites have always had a

49
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,210
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> strong voice and I think some of</font>

50
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,469
that might have to do with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> history</font>

51
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:43,140
working for Nick Denton at Gawker what

52
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,880
do you make of all the new kind of Robo

53
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,929
content factories like AOL seed or

54
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:51,060
demand media yeah associated content who

55
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,549
might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give a company like you a</font>

56
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:55,740
pipe<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you know constantly cheap</font>

57
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,899
streaming stuff coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that might be</font>

58
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,179
less expensive to produce say than<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

59
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:01,259
stuff you're doing yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I'm</font>

60
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:02,369
fascinated by<font color="#CCCCCC"> what these guys are doing</font>

61
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:04,380
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that has always drawn me</font>

62
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,509
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> blogs that I love is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the strong</font>

63
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:07,829
voice of the writers that write for them

64
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:10,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a blog populated</font>

65
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,590
with a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know Robo content for</font>

66
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,970
me would eliminate a lot of the value of

67
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,830
what our sites bring to the table which

68
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,390
is yeah you get in for me

69
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,160
from us but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you also want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

70
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,260
entertained<font color="#E5E5E5"> by a great blog and a site</font>

71
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,390
like curbed New York our editor Joey

72
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">Iraq here he takes the seemingly you</font>

73
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,060
know dull dull as anything topic of real

74
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,560
estate which traditionally has been

75
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">presented with such a bland way and like</font>

76
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,520
makes it a daily<font color="#E5E5E5"> dose of hilarity and I</font>

77
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,690
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why a lot of folks read the</font>

78
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,620
site and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wouldn't want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to screw with</font>

79
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,240
that how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it celebrity</font>

80
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,740
is it pictures it's a little of

81
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything it's also just having a sense</font>

82
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,010
of humor where you can you know make<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

83
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,360
blant something bland into something

84
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,100
funny I mean it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just having</font>

85
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,900
the talent so newspaper companies

86
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,550
obviously moving more online magazine

87
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,090
companies etc who comes in and gives you

88
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,680
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good run for your money well I think</font>

89
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">this stuff in New York</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> magazine does is</font>

90
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,280
spectacular and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the eater space they</font>

91
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">have their grub Street property and our</font>

92
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,940
eater property are sort of locked in a

93
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,850
classic<font color="#CCCCCC"> engadget gizmodo style death</font>

94
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,790
match each categories a little different

95
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,280
in racks category the fashion blog area

96
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,220
is tons of sites interestingly no one

97
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,600
seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have really broken out and</font>

98
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,670
created a site that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the dominant in</font>

99
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,769
the industry I think we have by focusing

100
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:21,269
on shopping we differentiate ourselves a

101
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:23,160
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in curbs case I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

102
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,459
we're really mostly you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a site like</font>

103
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,170
brownstoner here in New York which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

104
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,579
great brooklyn real estate blog i

105
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:31,350
wouldn't say competes with us but each

106
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,060
city has a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> other blogs sort of in</font>

107
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">the space but actually we all tend to</font>

108
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,480
play pretty nice together cool and I'd

109
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,799
be a fool if I didn't ask you<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

110
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:39,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">ipad is it something you're excited</font>

111
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,130
about or that something that you know

112
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,320
the magazine guys are getting fluffed

113
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,519
about but it's not really gonna do

114
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:45,840
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know I haven't talked</font>

115
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">to anyone in like new media and by that</font>

116
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,660
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean someone who like runs a company</font>

117
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,030
that's just new media that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

118
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,590
with an iPad strategy it's like all

119
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,239
these other guys need an iPad strategy

120
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,430
like I'm excited to get an iPad yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

121
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,870
if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> turns out that people want to</font>

122
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,610
consume content in some special way on

123
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,320
their iPad then I can't imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to</font>

124
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,060
be that<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard for us to build something</font>

125
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">that will let our content do that but</font>

126
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,079
the idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> having an iPad strategy to</font>

127
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:09,239
me right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now strikes me as just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> complete</font>

128
00:04:09,239 --> 00:00:00,000
absurdity
