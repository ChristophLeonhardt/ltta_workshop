1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,940
Puerto Ricans emerged from their homes today

2
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,320
to find an island utterly devastated
by Hurricane Maria.

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,500
Maria is just the latest in a nasty string of hurricanes

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,120
that suggest that deadly storms are
hitting with more frequency and power.

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,560
But scientists have upped their game, too:

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,360
with a new satellite called GOES-16

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,920
that produces the most detailed
hurricane images ever recorded.

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,200
VICE News spoke to Mike Stringer,
the NOAA engineer who runs the program.

9
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,850
— GOES-16 is better than the legacy satellites
that are up there previously,

10
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,460
because it has three times the spectral resolution—

11
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,160
in other words, the number of color bands it can see.

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,460
It has four times the resolution as the legacy satellites

13
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:57,960
and five times the refresh rate
of being able to take images.

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,120
Where are the old satellites,

15
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,420
they could do a mesoscale,
but they had to stop doing everything else.

16
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,420
So, we can do all of that at the same time.

17
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,300
We can look at the clouds and,
from one time step to the next,

18
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,280
see where that cloud is moving
and tell how the winds are.

19
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,660
Those winds can then be put in the models

20
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,200
and used to say how that hurricane’s going to move.

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,860
The other new instrument we have on the satellite

22
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,460
is a geostationary lightning mapper.

23
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,920
And so this sees all the lightning,

24
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,800
and scientists have done some analysis showing
that when that total lightning count jumps,

25
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,920
that’s usually a precursor indicator
that that storm is getting very severe

26
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,240
and could produce severe hail, possibly tornados.

27
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,520
Another feature that it allows us to do,

28
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,580
but we’re not as focused on right now
because of the hurricanes,

29
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,380
is to detect fires.

30
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,760
We can see fires in hot spots around the country

31
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,880
and we’ve been able to look at the heat patterns change

32
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,280
and follow that direction of that front moving through.

33
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,800
In the last about five years, on average,

34
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,940
there’s been 10 billion-dollar weather-related disasters.

35
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,620
This year, before Harvey,

36
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,540
I believe the number had been seven already.

37
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:19,240
The estimates on Harvey are tens of billions,
or even maybe a hundred billion.

38
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,240
So, by creating these programs
and getting the satellites up

39
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,840
and be able to get the information
out quicker to people,

40
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,060
they’ll be able to protect themselves.

41
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,700
And depending on what the type of event it is,

42
00:02:30,700 --> 00:00:00,000
they may even be able to protect their property.
