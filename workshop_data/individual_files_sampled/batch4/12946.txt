from Marcus I Michael I love your show my question when should we hit a bully back twice as hard and when should we turn the other cheek please answer using biblical references people misunderstand this all the time a lot of people who would just take Christianity to be just some small aspect of it they'll become pacifists they'll say we should never punch back don't ever fight back they've only read a couple lines of the Bible and they'll say see it says this they haven't read the other things GK Chesterton wrote an orthodoxy that heresy is not the promotion of Vice it's the just the promotion of one virtue to the exclusion of all the others that's what they're getting at but don't forget to classy ass T's there is a time for everything and a season for every purpose under heaven there's a time for war and a time for peace in the same breath that Christ says turn the other cheek he also says if your right eye causes you to sin pluck it out and throw it away I don't know that he means that literally if your right hand causes you to sin cut it off and throw it away I don't know that he means that literally as we mean literally he says do not say anything other than yes or no everything else that you say comes to evil of course he doesn't mean that literally because he says many other things and he tells st. Paul takes many oaths it takes many vows he says only pray in your inner closet but then Christ praise in public as well so Christ also says to the Apostles if you don't have a sword sell your cloak and buy one he says that very explicitly st. Augustine and st. Thomas Aquinas both explained just war very well all the reasons when wars can legitimately be undertaken Santa Claus himself st. Nicholas punched a heretic in the face at the first Council of Nicaea when we're talking about that Sermon on the Mount Christ sums up the whole sermon in the next chapter he says seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things shall be yours as well that's what he's telling us seek first the kingdom of God then follow everything else and then he gives us these examples these parabolic examples these hyperbolic examples do not you shouldn't strike back at somebody for spite or for cruelty or even really for vengeance so I don't think that you should be doing it say ah that'll hurt him and that will give me pleasure and joy but our Lord is also not telling us to be doormats and to let the cruel rape the face of the earth Christ is speaking of a spiritual strategy to Humble the self and to win other souls over to him but not everybody is moved necessarily by this humility so we should love our neighbors as ourselves but sometimes we all need a little bit of tough love don't we a priest friend of mine keeps a baseball bat near the door of his rectory because it's not a great neighborhood there have been break-ins and burglaries of the poor box I one time asked him about this and he explained it to me sometimes there just isn't time to turn the other cheek that's my feeling as well
