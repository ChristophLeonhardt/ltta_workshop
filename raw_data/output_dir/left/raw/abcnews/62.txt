THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS ABOUT

00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,576
OTHER THAN THAT, NO OTHER 

43
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,043

TIME OF THE SHOOTING, BUT 

49
00:01:25,851 --> 00:01:27,620
ESPECIALLY AFTER THE DISCOVERY

HER AND ASK HER HOW COULD SHE 

55
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:37,463

WEAPONS OR AT LEAST ALTERED SO 

60
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:47,073
THEY COULD FIRE AS AN AUTOMATIC 

61
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:47,307
WEAPON. 

62
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,509
>> EXACTLY, GEORGE.

63
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,144
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS 

64
00:01:52,144 --> 00:01:53,613
PERPLEXED ABOUT THE SCALE OF 

65
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,947
WHAT THIS MAN PLANNED AND HOW 

66
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:57,417
PRECISE HE WAS, GEORGE, AND 42

CONVERTED WE'RE TOLD AT LEAST 

71
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:04,790
TWO CONVERTED THAT WOULD TAKE 

72
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,060
THEM FROM BASICALLY OPERATING AS

73
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,061
A SEMI-AUTOMATIC RIFLE TO ONE 

74
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:11,264
THAT FUNCTIONED ESSENTIALLY AS A

75
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:12,665
MACHINE GUN.

76
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:13,599
CONTINUOUS FLOW OF BULLETS 

77
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,235
COMING OUT AND MAKING IT VERY 

78
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,936
EASY TO SHOOT ALL THOSE PEOPLE. 

79
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,337
>> MATT GUTMAN ON THE SCENE IN 

80
00:02:18,337 --> 00:02:20,139
LAS VEGAS, YOU'VE BEEN INSIDE 

81
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:21,708
THE MANDALAY BAY HOTEL.

HOURS. 

85
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:27,280
>> Reporter: IT SEEMED THAT HE 

86
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,848
HUNKERED DOWN IN THERE, GEORGE, 

87
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:30,516
PRETTY EXTENSIVELY FOR THOSE 48 

88
00:02:30,516 --> 00:02:32,151
HOURS, IN THE AFTERMATH WE'VE 

89
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:33,753
SEEN THESE NEW PICTURES OF THAT 

90
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:36,322
SUITE FROM WHICH HE FIRED -- HE 

91
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,290
APPARENTLY PUNCHED THROUGH TWO 

92
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,125
HOLES AND EXPOSED THIS ENTIRE 

93
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,627
CONCERT VENUE TO FIRE.

94
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,862
WHAT'S MOST STARTLING ABOUT THIS

95
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:43,963
IS THAT THOSE LONG GUNS THAT 

96
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:47,199
WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO, THE .762 

97
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:49,135
CALIBER WEAPONS HAVE A RANGE OF 

98
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:51,638
UP TO 1,000 YARDS, EASILY WITHIN

99
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,039
RANGE OF THIS VENUE BUT THAT 

100
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,040
ATTACK COULD NOT HAVE BEEN 

101
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,341
COMMITTED IF HE ONLY HAVE BEEN 

102
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,509
USING HANDGUNS THEY SIMPLY DON'T

103
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,344
HAVE THE RANGE, IT'S ABOUT 350 

104
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,080
TO 400 YARDS FROM HIS HOTEL 

105
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,749

STABILIZE THE GUNS AND REMOTE 

109
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,023
CAMERA SET UP IN THE ROOM?

110
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:10,957
>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT, WE 

111
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,024
HEAR THAT THERE ARE CAMERAS OR 

112
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:13,626
HE HAD AT LEAST ONE CAMERA AT 

113
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:15,027
SOME POINT TRAINED ON HIMSELF 

114
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:17,262
FOR PART OF IT, OBVIOUSLY THE 

115
00:03:17,262 --> 00:03:18,698
FBI AND OTHER AGENCIES ARE 

116
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,598
KEEPING THAT VERY CLOSE TO THE 

117
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:21,301
VEST AND OF COURSE WE DON'T KNOW

118
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,036
THE PURPOSE OF THAT CAMERA, AS 

119
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:26,005
WE STILL DON'T KNOW HIS 

120
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,540
MOTIVATION FOR PERPETRATING THIS

121
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,742
HORRIFIC ACT, GEORGE. 

122
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:32,311

FREQUENTED CASINOS, WAS IN SOME

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,516
WAYS -- I'M NOT GOING TO USE THE

125
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,284
WORD PROFESSIONAL BUT AN AVID 

126
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,118
GAMBLER OF VIDEO POKER. 

127
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:41,220
>> LOTS OF ACTIVITY, LOTS OF 

128
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:41,553
TRANSACTIONS.

129
00:03:41,553 --> 00:03:44,022
WE ARE TRACKING AS MANY AS 200 

130
00:03:44,022 --> 00:03:45,324
TRANSACTIONS THAT HE MAY HAVE 

131
00:03:45,324 --> 00:03:46,759
MADE THAT MAY HAVE COME TO THE 

132
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,294
ATTENTION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, 

133
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:48,861
GEORGE.

134
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,162
AGAIN, SO MANY UNANSWERED 

135
00:03:50,162 --> 00:03:51,297
QUESTIONS AND ONE OFFICIAL I 

136
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,798
TALKED TO JUST A COUPLE HOURS 

137
00:03:52,798 --> 00:03:54,667
AGO SAID, PIERRE, BY NOW WE 

138
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,537
NORMALLY KNOW A LOT MORE ABOUT 

139
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:57,770
MOTIVE.

140
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,404
VERY CONCERNING. 

141
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,406
>> ONE OF THE BRINGS, BRIAN 

142
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,208
ROSS, IS APPARENTLY THEY HADN'T 

143
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,609
FOUND YET ANY SOCIAL MEDIA 

144
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:03,876
ACCOUNTS. 

145
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:05,345
>> NOT THAT WE CAN SEE AT ALL.

146
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,080
HIS GIRLFRIEND DID HAVE A

00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,447
FACEBOOK PAGE NOW TAKEN DOWN, 

148
00:04:08,447 --> 00:04:11,351
BUT NOTHING THAT WE SAW OF MR. 

149
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,785

150
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:15,254
>> AND MARILOU DANLEY ONE OF THE

151
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:17,555
THINGS THAT SURPRISED ALL OF US 

152
00:04:17,555 --> 00:04:19,257
WAS HOW QUICKLY AUTHORITIES CAME

153
00:04:19,257 --> 00:04:20,059
TO THE CONCLUSION THEY SAID THAT

154
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,461
SHE WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THIS IN 

155
00:04:22,461 --> 00:04:22,762
ANY WAY.

156
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,863
IS THERE SKEPTICISM RISING?

157
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:26,198
>> CERTAINLY IS AND THEY'RE 

158
00:04:26,198 --> 00:04:27,266
DIALING BACK THAT EARLY 

159
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:27,966
STATEMENT SAYING NOW THEY WANT 

160
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:29,535
TO TALK TO HER ABOUT THE 

161
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:30,670
POSSIBILITY SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD A

162
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,070
ROLE.

163
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,271
THE QUESTION REALLY HOW COULD 

164
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:34,240
SHE NOT KNOW THERE WERE SO MANY 

165
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,074
WEAPONS AT THE HOUSE THAT HE HAD

166
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,609
BEEN STOCKPILING THESE OVER 

167
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,578
SEVERAL WEEKS AND ALSO THE 

168
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:39,445
QUESTION OF THE MONEY TRANSFERS

THERE. 

174
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:47,086
>> WE KNOW THAT HE SENT THE 

175
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:48,120
MONEY TO THE PHILIPPINES, WE 

176
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,322
DON'T KNOW IT WAS TO HER. 

177
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:49,722
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 

178
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:50,590
>> BUT ALSO

179
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,124
LEARNED YESTERDAY, BRIAN, IS 

180
00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:53,959
THAT AT LEAST NEIGHBORS OF THE

THEY SAID ACTING RELATIVELY 

184
00:04:58,931 --> 00:04:59,198
NORMALLY. 

185
00:04:59,198 --> 00:04:59,565
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

186
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:01,367
SHE ARRIVED IN THE PHILIPPINES 

187
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,802
ACCORDING TO TRAVEL RECORDS THAT

188
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,136
ABC HAS REVIEWED ON SEPTEMBER 

189
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:06,072
15th WHICH WAS JUST TWO WEEKS OR

190
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,707
SO BEFORE THE SHOOTING.

191
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,341
SHE HAD NOT BEEN THERE IN A 

192
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:10,643
COUPLE YEARS.

193
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,679
SHE WAS THERE, MADE A QUICK TRIP

194
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:15,047
TO HONG KONG, BACK TO THE 

195
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:17,516
PHILIPPINES AND WAS IN THE 

196
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:18,150
PHILIPPINES ON THE DAY OF THE 

197
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,253
SHOOTING WE WERE TOLD. 

198
00:05:21,253 --> 00:05:22,254
>> HEAR COMES THE SHERIFF.

199
00:05:22,254 --> 00:05:25,824
LET'S LISTEN IN.

200
00:05:25,824 --> 00:05:26,759
>> I DON'T HAVE ROOM FOR -- THIS

201
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:35,034
IS NOT GOING TO WORK.

202
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:40,072
>> DID WE GET EVERYBODY IN?

203
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:41,007
WHERE IS KEN?

204
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,575
OH, THERE HE IS.

205
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:49,882
I HAVE TO KEEP MY EYE ON YOU.

206
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:50,115
CARLOS?

207
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:50,883
ARE WE GOOD?

208
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:51,684
ALL RIGHT.

209
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,886
WE'RE NOT GOING TO SHOW ANY 

210
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:54,420
VIDEO.

211
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:54,620
OKAY.

212
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,954
ALL RIGHT.

213
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,823
GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYBODY.

214
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:59,224
YOU ALL ARE AWARE WHO I AM, 

215
00:05:59,224 --> 00:06:01,928
SHERIFF JOE LOMBARDO, CLARK 

216
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:02,361
COUNTY.

217
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,297
THERE'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT

218
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,331
DIFFERENT ORCHESTRATION IN THIS 

219
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,199
PRESS CONFERENCE AS COMPARED TO 

220
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:07,700
THE REST.

221
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,368
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO RIGHT NOW, 

222
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:11,637
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE 

223
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:14,574
ADDRESS THE VICTIM ISSUES WE ARE

224
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,108
EXPERIENCING AND THE RESOURCE 

225
00:06:16,108 --> 00:06:17,376
ISSUES THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING.

226
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:20,212
SO I'M GOING TO KEY ON THAT.

227
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:23,015
ON THE ORIGINAL PORTION OF THIS 

228
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,750
AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY 

229
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,720
COMMISSIONER SISLAK IS GOING TO 

230
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,122
PROVIDE DONATION INFORMATION AND

231
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:31,023
ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND AFTER THAT I 

232
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:33,459
WILL COME BACK TO THE PODIUM AND

233
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,461
ADDRESS THE OVERALL 

234
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:36,262
INVESTIGATION, WHERE WE STAND 

235
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,865
AND WHERE WE ARE GOING.

236
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:39,932
NOW, REFERENCE TO THE 

237
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:40,699
INVESTIGATION PIECE, I DON'T 

238
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:43,602
WANT TO REPEAT OF WHAT I 

239
00:06:43,602 --> 00:06:44,403
EXPERIENCED YESTERDAY.

240
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,105
IT'S AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION.

241
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,606
SO I WILL BE LIMITED IN THE 

242
00:06:47,606 --> 00:06:50,676
DETAILS THAT I PROVIDE YOU, BUT 

243
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:51,610
HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THROUGH 

244
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:55,448
THIS WITH SOME MODICUM OF 

245
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:55,748
DECORUM.

246
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,316
SO PLEASE DON'T RUSH ME ALL AT 

247
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,051
ONCE WHEN WE GET TO THE QUESTION

248
00:06:59,051 --> 00:06:59,318
PHASE.

249
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:00,886
I WILL IDENTIFY YOU IF YOU JUST 

250
00:07:00,886 --> 00:07:03,222
RAISE YOUR HAND.

251
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:03,890
SOUND FAIR?

252
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,390
ALL RIGHT.

253
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:08,127
WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS.

254
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:08,394
OKAY.

255
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,029
SO AS A MATTER OF FORMALITY OUR 

256
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:10,763
DEPARTMENT HAS WORKED THROUGH 

257
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,631
THE NIGHT TO IDENTIFY ALL THE 

258
00:07:12,631 --> 00:07:14,634
VICTIMS OF SUNDAY EVENING'S MASS

259
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:15,801
SHOOTING ON ROUTE -- AT THE 

260
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:17,603
ROUTE 91 HARVEST FESTIVAL.

261
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,506
WE HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL BUT THREE

262
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:20,739
VICTIMS.

263
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:22,841
WE STILL HAVE AN ACTIVE SCENE AT

264
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:26,145
THE GROUNDS NEAR MANDALAY BAY SO

265
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:26,712
WE ASK ANYONE TO STAY AWAY 

266
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,180
INTEREST THAT AREA UNTIL FURTHER

267
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:28,413
NOTICE.

268
00:07:28,413 --> 00:07:31,884
THE FBI IS WORKING DILIGENTLY TO

269
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:32,451
CLEAR THAT SCENE.

270
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:36,188
SO THE QUESTION IS THE FBI 

271
00:07:36,188 --> 00:07:40,059
VERSUS US.

272
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:40,793
WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH THE FBI, 

273
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,928
AS I SAID, FROM THE VERY 

274
00:07:42,928 --> 00:07:44,430
BEGINNING OF THIS IN THE 

275
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:44,964
INVESTIGATIVE PHASE.

276
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,567
THE FBI HAS BROUGHT A LARGE 

277
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:49,801
AMOUNT OF RESOURCES OUT OF 

278
00:07:49,801 --> 00:07:51,570
WASHINGTON, D.C. TO ASSIST US 

279
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,306
WITH THAT.

280
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,641
SO THE REASON WHY THE HARVEST 

281
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,710
FESTIVAL WAS STILL IN 

282
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,945
CONTINUATION OF INVESTIGATION IS

283
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:02,781
NOT ONLY SOLELY RELATED TO THE 

284
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:04,316
REMOVAL OF THE VICTIMS, BUT IT'S

285
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:06,118
ALSO DOCUMENTATION OF THE SCENE.

286
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:09,822
SO WE'RE USING THE BEST PRACTICE

287
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,156
TECHNOLOGY TO ENSURE THAT WE 

288
00:08:11,156 --> 00:08:12,158
HAVE COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION.

289
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,594
THAT'S WHY IT IS TAKING A LONGER

290
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,896
PERIOD OF TIME ASSOCIATED WITH 

291
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:17,163
THIS.

292
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,533
SO WE ASK FOR EVERYBODY'S 

293
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:21,567
PATIENCE.

294
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:22,334
AS FAR AS LAS VEGAS BOULEVARD, 

295
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:25,471
NORTH AND SOUTH, WE ANTICIPATE 

296
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,706
TO BE OPEN SHORTLY, IN THE NEXT 

297
00:08:27,706 --> 00:08:29,442
FEW HOURS, TO BENEFIT WITH 

298
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:33,679
COMMERCE AND WHAT WE DO AS A 

299
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:33,946
COMMUNITY.

300
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:34,212
ALL RIGHT.

301
00:08:34,212 --> 00:08:36,414
THE KEY COMPONENT HERE IS 

302
00:08:36,414 --> 00:08:39,051
RESOURCES AND VICTIM 

303
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:39,418
IDENTIFICATION.

304
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:42,020
SO BEAR WITH ME, I'M GOING TO 

305
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,255
TRY TO GET THROUGH THIS THE BEST

306
00:08:43,255 --> 00:08:44,757
I CAN, BUT THE IMPORTANT PIECE

00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:47,559

SHORT PROCESS HERE RECENTLY 

353
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,267

BUT WE HAVE COMPLETED THE 

536
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,771
INVESTIGATION AT THE RENO

AT THREE SEPARATE LOCATIONS THAT

546
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,559

547
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,661

548
00:16:36,661 --> 00:16:39,531

00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:44,128
>> WHAT'S THE CLARITY?

741
00:22:44,128 --> 00:22:48,333
WHAT'S THE CLARITY YOU'RE 

742
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:48,566
SEEKING?

743
00:22:48,566 --> 00:22:51,436
>> WHAT TIME THE SHOTS RANG OUT,

744
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:52,470
WHAT TIME YOU RECEIVED THE 

745
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,205
CALL -- 

746
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,174
>> WE RECEIVED A CALL AT 10:08 

747
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:56,340
P.M.

748
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,977
THE BEST OF OUR ESTIMATES AND 

749
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:01,546
VIDEO REVIEW HE CONTINUED TO 

750
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,949
FIRE AT A PROGRESSIVE SUCCESSIVE

751
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:05,917
RATE FOR APPROXIMATELY NINE 

752
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:06,218
MINUTES.

753
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,986
AS YOU CAN SEE BY ANY VIDEO YOU 

754
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,621
SEE IN THE PUBLIC SPACE IT WAS 

755
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:10,589
HARD TO DETERMINE WHERE THEY 

756
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:13,391
WERE COMING FROM.

757
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:14,025
ONCE IT WAS EVALUATED IT WAS 

758
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:16,361
COMING FROM THE MANDALAY BAY, AS

759
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:17,495
YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW HARD IT 

760
00:23:17,495 --> 00:23:18,563
WOULD BE TO PINPOINT THE ROOM 

761
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:21,733
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

762
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,169
OFFICERS SUBSEQUENTLY FORMED UP,

763
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,204
TEAMED UP AND MOVED OVER TO THE 

764
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:27,338
MANDALAY BAY TO -- IN ORDER TO 

765
00:23:27,338 --> 00:23:30,642
LOCATE AND ENGAGE, BUT THAT WAS 

766
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,510
IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MANDALAY

767
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,612
BAY SECURITY.

768
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:34,512
NOW, THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR 

769
00:23:34,512 --> 00:23:36,848
ME TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

770
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:40,385
THE MANDALAY BAY SECURITY WAS 

771
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:41,086
FANTASTIC.

772
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,587
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY ASSUMING 

773
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,989
THAT THEY ARE UNSAFE BY, YOU 

774
00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:47,092
KNOW, STAYING AT ONE OF OUR 

775
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:47,993
HOTELS.

776
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:51,195
WE WOULD NOT HAVE ENGAGED THIS 

777
00:23:51,195 --> 00:23:52,196
INDIVIDUAL IN THE TIME LAPSE 

778
00:23:52,196 --> 00:23:54,432
THAT WE DID WITHOUT THEIR 

779
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:54,933
ASSISTANCE.

780
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,901
WE RECEIVED INFORMATION VIA 

781
00:23:56,901 --> 00:23:59,003
THEIR DISPATCH CENTER AND OR 

782
00:23:59,003 --> 00:24:01,105
THEIR OPERATIONS CENTER, THEIR 

783
00:24:01,105 --> 00:24:03,341
CALL CENTER FROM INDIVIDUALS 

784
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:04,976
STAYING WITHIN THE MANDALAY BAY 

785
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:06,878
THAT HELPED US LOCATE WHERE THIS

786
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:08,479
INDIVIDUAL WAS SEQUESTERED.

787
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:08,847
HOLD ON.

788
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:11,650
I WANT TO FINNISH HER QUESTION.

789
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,317
ALL RIGHT?

790
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:16,555
AND SO SUBSEQUENTLY THAT TAKES 

791
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:18,155
TIME AS YOU CAN IMAGINE MOVING 

792
00:24:18,155 --> 00:24:19,958
FROM THE LOCATION OF THE EVENT, 

793
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,793
DEE NIEGD WHETHER YOU ARE GOING 

794
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,528
TO HELP VICTIMS EVACUATE OR YOU 

795
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:25,230
ARE GOING TO DECIDE WHETHER YOU 

796
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,965
ARE GOING TO TAKE CHARGE AND PUT

797
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,499
AN ELEMENT TOGETHER AND GO 

798
00:24:28,499 --> 00:24:29,567
ENGAGE THIS INDIVIDUAL.

799
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:33,204
SO WE HAVE A LOT OF BIFURCATION 

800
00:24:33,204 --> 00:24:34,172
OF RESPONSIBILITIES ASSOCIATED, 

801
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:35,740
ESPECIALLY IN A DYNAMIC EVENT.

802
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,276
I WANT TO SAY KUDOS TO THOSE 

803
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:41,112
OFFICERS THAT GOT TOGETHER AND 

804
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:42,013
SAID THIS IS WHAT WE TRAINED 

805
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:43,414
FOR, ACTIVE SHOOTER, WE'RE 

806
00:24:43,414 --> 00:24:45,216
PUTTING AN ELEMENT TOGETHER, 

807
00:24:45,216 --> 00:24:46,517
LET'S GO ENGAGE THIS INDIVIDUAL 

808
00:24:46,517 --> 00:24:47,252
AND LOCATE THEM.

809
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:47,586
OKAY?

810
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,020
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID.

811
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,256
AND WHEN THE SECURITY OFFICER 

812
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:54,826
WAS ENGAGED BY THE SUSPECT, WE 

813
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,127
BACKED OFF FROM IMMEDIATE 

814
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,361
APPREHENSION AND S.W.A.T. TEAM 

815
00:24:57,361 --> 00:24:59,330
FORMED AND MADE ENTRY. 

816
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:00,765
>> WHAT TIME WAS THE SECURITY 

817
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:01,566
OFFICER ENGAGED?

818
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,335
>> I DON'T HAVE THAT TIME FOR 

819
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:03,535
YOU. 

820
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:04,536
>> SHERIFF, HOW CONCERNED ARE 

821
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:05,737
YOU ABOUT YOUR OFFICERS FACING 

822
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:06,571
WEAPONS LIKE THIS?

823
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:07,539
>> ABSOLUTELY CONCERNED.

824
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:10,809
THE WORLD HAS CHANGED AND, YOU 

825
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,577
KNOW, WHO WOULD HAVE EVER 

826
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:13,244
IMAGINED THIS SITUATION?

827
00:25:13,244 --> 00:25:14,846
I COULDN'T IMAGINE IT.

828
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,314
AND FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL TO TAKE 

829
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:18,783
IT UPON HIMSELF TO CREATE THIS 

830
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:22,020
CHAOS AND HARM IS UNSPEAKABLE.

831
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,522
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO TRY TO 

832
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:27,225
SPITBALL OR WHAT IF THESE 

833
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:29,027
SITUATIONS AT ALL POINTS WHEN WE

834
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,628
TRAIN AND ENSURE THAT WE HAVE 

835
00:25:30,628 --> 00:25:31,963
PROPER RESPONSE AND I THINK WE 

836
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:33,497
DID A FANTASTIC JOB. 

837
00:25:33,497 --> 00:25:34,966
>> MANDALAY BAY SECURITY 

838
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:36,834
IDENTIFIED THE ROOM BEFORE 

839
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:38,637
S.W.A.T. ARRIVED?

840
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:39,237
>> NO.

841
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:40,739
WELL, YEAH, BEFORE S.W.A.T. 

842
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:41,872
ARRIVED, BUT NOT BEFORE MY 

843
00:25:41,872 --> 00:25:44,843
OFFICERS ARRIVED.

844
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:45,677
THEY WERE MARRIED OR HAND TO 

845
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:48,546
HAND WITH MY OFFICERS WHEN WE 

846
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:49,848
MADE ENTRY OVER TO THE HOTEL AND

847
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:51,582
IT WAS A MATTER OF -- IF YOU 

848
00:25:51,582 --> 00:25:54,653
RECALL YESTERDAY I SAID BETWEEN 

849
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:57,989
FLOOR 29 AND 32 AND DURING THAT 

850
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:00,659
PROCESS OF EVALUATING THE FLOORS

851
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:01,959
WE RECEIVED ADDITIONAL 

852
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:04,029
INFORMATION WHERE HE WAS LOCATED

853
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:06,431
AND THEY IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED. 

854
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:08,266
>> WHAT TIME DID S.W.A.T. BREACH

855
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:08,900
HIS SUITE?

856
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,870
>> I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER FOR 

857
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:12,070
YOU. 

858
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,105
>> DID HE CONTINUE TO SHOOT 

859
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,407
UNTIL THE SITUATE TEAM CAME IN 

860
00:26:16,407 --> 00:26:17,808
OR WHY DID HE STOP SHOOTING?

861
00:26:17,808 --> 00:26:20,978
>> THAT'S FOR US TO EVALUATE IN 

862
00:26:20,978 --> 00:26:24,315
THE INVESTIGATION.

863
00:26:24,315 --> 00:26:24,949
[ INAUDIBLE QUESTION ]

864
00:26:24,949 --> 00:26:26,618
>> NO, THEY WERE THROUGHOUT THE 

865
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:30,922
VENUE, THEY EVEN HAD SOME 

866
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,490
VICTIMS WHO MET THEIR DEMISE 

867
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,058
OUTSIDE OF THE VENUE AND THEN WE

868
00:26:34,058 --> 00:26:35,727
HAD INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD BEEN 

869
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:37,428
SHOT AND THEY CONTINUED TO RUN 

870
00:26:37,428 --> 00:26:40,164
AWAY AND THEN THEY PASSED AWAY 

871
00:26:40,164 --> 00:26:43,201
SEVERAL BLOCKS FROM THE VENUE.

872
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:46,337
WE ALSO HAD VERY HEROIC ACTS OF 

873
00:26:46,337 --> 00:26:49,073
PEOPLE ATTENDING THE EVENT, WE 

874
00:26:49,073 --> 00:26:50,642
HAVE NUMEROUS VIDEOS DEPICTING 

875
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,677
PEOPLE ATTENDING, NORMAL 

876
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:54,145
CITIZENS, PROVIDING MEDICAL AID 

877
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:56,581
AND PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION FOR

878
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:58,949
VICTIMS TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL. 

879
00:26:58,949 --> 00:27:00,017
>> SHERIFF. 

880
00:27:00,017 --> 00:27:00,551
>> YES, SIR.

881
00:27:00,551 --> 00:27:05,390
>> GOING BACK TO THE POINT OF MY

882
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,591
COLLEAGUE THAT THERE BEING A 

883
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:08,626
CAMERA IN THE ROOM, I'M SORRY IF

884
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:10,795
I'M INTERPRETING THIS WRONGLY, 

885
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:15,400
IT SOUNDS LIKE HE HAD SET THOSE 

886
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:15,900
SAM

887
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,968
CAMERAS UP TO GIVE HIMSELF A 

888
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,169
WARNING OF THE APPROACH OF 

889
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:18,737
POLICE OFFICERS.

890
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,337
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO GET IN 

891
00:27:20,337 --> 00:27:22,207
THE MIND OF A MADMAN, HOW WOULD 

892
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:23,241
YOU JOURNAL THIS MAN'S 

893
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:24,242
PREPARATION AND DETERMINATION TO

894
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:26,010
DO THIS BASED ON -- 

895
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,780
>> I DON'T EVEN NEED THAT BIT OF

896
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,681
INFORMATION TO MAKE A JUDGMENT.

897
00:27:30,681 --> 00:27:32,717
THIS INDIVIDUAL IS PREMEDICATED,

898
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:36,053
OBVIOUSLY PREMEDICATED.

899
00:27:36,053 --> 00:27:36,687
THE FACT THAT HE HAD THE TYPE OF

900
00:27:36,687 --> 00:27:37,889
WEAPONRY AND THE AMOUNT OF 

901
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:40,125
WEAPONRY IN THE ROOM, IT WAS 

902
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,059
PREPLANNED, EXTENSIVELY AND I'M 

903
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:42,260
PRETTY SURE HE EVALUATED 

904
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,729
EVERYTHING THAT HE DID IN HIS 

905
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:45,463
ACTIONS.

906
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:48,266
WHICH IS TROUBLESOME.

907
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,868
I WAS HOPING -- YOU KNOW, I PRAY

908
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:53,270
THAT IN THESE SITUATIONS THAT A 

909
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:53,938
CITIZEN -- BECAUSE WE CAN'T BE 

910
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:56,340
AT ALL PLACES AT ALL TIMES -- 

911
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,642
THAT A CITIZEN SEES SOMETHING, 

912
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:58,877
SAYS SOMETHING AND WE ACT ON 

913
00:27:58,877 --> 00:27:59,210
THAT.

914
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,678
QUITE OFTEN WHAT WE EXPERIENCE 

915
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:02,914
IN OUR LINE OF WORK A CITIZEN 

916
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:04,415
THINKS IT'S TRIVIAL AND THEY 

917
00:28:04,415 --> 00:28:05,784
SAY, NO, I DON'T WANT TO BOTHER 

918
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:06,184
THE POLICE.

919
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,085
WITH HE ASK YOU TO BOTHER THE 

920
00:28:08,085 --> 00:28:11,422
POLICE BECAUSE THOSE INDIVIDUALS

921
00:28:11,422 --> 00:28:12,256

ANYBODY IN THE PUBLIC SPACE THAT

924
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:18,429
CAN ASSIST US WE ASK THEM TO. 

925
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:21,065
>> SHERIFF, DO YOU KNOW IF HIS 

926
00:28:21,065 --> 00:28:22,433
GIRLFRIEND HAS ANY KNOWLEDGE -- 

927
00:28:22,433 --> 00:28:24,401
>> RICARDO. 

928
00:28:24,401 --> 00:28:26,905
>> DID POLICE OR SECURITY GUARDS

929
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:27,472
FIRE ANY SHOTS AT ANY TIME 

930
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:31,743
DURING THE ENCOUNTER?

931
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:32,744
>> DURING WHILE HE WAS DIS

932
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:33,778
DISCHARGING HIS WEAPONS WE ARE 

933
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:34,579
NOT AWARE OF THAT.

934
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:35,713
NO SECURITY GUARD OR POLICE 

935
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:38,016
OTHER THAN THE ENCOUNTER AT THE 

936
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,249
ROOM. 

937
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:39,751
>> CAN YOU EXPAND ON WHAT WENT 

938
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:39,951
RIGHT.

939
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,352
I KNOW YOU PRACTICE FOR 

940
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:42,720
SCENARIOS LIKE THIS, NOT EXACTLY

941
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,654
THIS SCENARIO.

942
00:28:43,654 --> 00:28:45,890
CAN YOU EXPAND ON WHAT WENT 

943
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,090
RIGHT?

944
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,760
>> I'M GLAD YOU ASKED THAT, 

945
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,460
RICARDO, BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY 

946
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,562
PEOPLE HAVE THE ASSUMPTION 

947
00:28:51,562 --> 00:28:53,764
THINGS WENT WRONG IN THIS TYPE 

948
00:28:53,764 --> 00:28:55,800
OF CARNAGE BUT WHAT WENT RIGHT 

949
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,403
IS WE SAVED HUNDREDS OF LIVES.

950
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,205
IN AN EVENT AND THIS GUY HAVING 

951
00:29:01,205 --> 00:29:02,573
THE ABILITY WITH THOSE WEAPONRY,

952
00:29:02,573 --> 00:29:04,309
THE CARNAGE THAT COULD OCCUR 

953
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,811
OUTSIDE OF WHAT DID OCCUR, A LOT

954
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:10,315
MORE WAS PREVENTED BECAUSE OF 

955
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:11,850
OUR POLICE ACTION IN SHORT TIME 

956
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,252
AND PRIVATE SECURITY ACTION IN 

957
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:17,822
SHORT TIME TO SAVE SOME LIVES.

958
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:19,290
>> WITH ALL OF THIS IN THE ROOM,

959
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,191
THE CAMERAS NOW, THE GUNS, 

960
00:29:21,191 --> 00:29:22,026
EVERYTHING ELSE YESTERDAY YOU 

961
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:25,029
HAD SAID THAT THERE HAD BEEN 

962
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,264
HOTEL STAFF INSIDE THAT ROOM 

963
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,266
DURING THAT STAY, IS THAT STILL 

964
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,801
BELIEVED, DID HE TURN AWAY 

965
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:30,134
HOUSEKEEPING?

966
00:29:30,134 --> 00:29:31,236
>> THE ONLY THING I KNOW AT THIS

967
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:32,603
POINT IS ROOM SERVICE WAS 

968
00:29:32,603 --> 00:29:32,870
PROVIDED. 

969
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:36,607
>> SHERIFF, COULD I ASK YOU -- 

970
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:38,509
I'M SORRY IT'S A POINT I WANT TO

971
00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:39,444
CLARIFY -- DO YOU BELIEVE YOU 

972
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,112
ARE GOING TO FIND THE MOTIVE FOR

973
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:41,746
THIS CRIME?

974
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:45,083
>> I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THAT. 

975
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,383
>> THE GIRLFRIEND, DO YOU KNOW 

976
00:29:46,383 --> 00:29:46,717
WHERE SHE IS?

977
00:29:46,717 --> 00:29:49,186
>> YES, I DO. 

978
00:29:49,186 --> 00:29:50,455
>> WHY IS FBI NOT TRYING TO 

979
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,222
BRING HER BACK?

980
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:52,390
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT 

981
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:52,690
OCCURRING?

982
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,692
>> I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I'M 

983
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:54,925
ASKING.

984
00:29:54,925 --> 00:29:55,693
IS THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING. 

985
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:59,264
>> THAT IS OCCURRING.

986
00:29:59,264 --> 00:29:59,597
YES, MA'AM. 

987
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:00,498
>> YOU HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING 

988
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:01,799

>> I'M SO GLAD YOU ASKED THAT.

992
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:07,872
NO, I AM.

993
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,642
I'M NOT BEING SARCASTIC.

994
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,276
WE'RE DOING GOOD.

995
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,778
I'M ACTUALLY VERY PROUD OF OUR 

996
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:14,011

PARTNERSHIPS I BELIEVE IN THE

UNITED STATES AS FAR AS PUBLIC 

1008
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:34,132
SAFETY.

1009
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:35,666
WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO 

1010
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:38,336
ACCOMPLISH WHAT WE DID AS YOU 

1011
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,637
DESCRIBED IN THE LAST 48 HOURS 

1012
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:41,039
WITHOUT THAT PARTNERSHIP.

1013
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,207
THE FBI STEPPING TO THE PLATE TO

00:30:43,207 --> 00:30:45,276
HELP US WITH EVIDENCE,

INJURIES, THE INJURY COUNT, HAS 

1027
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:06,698
GONE DOWN BY ABOUT 20, THERE WAS

1028
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:10,868
SOME DOUBLE COUNTING AT ONE OF 

1029
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:12,103
THE HOSPITALS.

I WANT TO BRING IN PIERRE 

1033

1034
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:18,075
PIERRE, A COUPLE THINGS THERE 

1035
00:31:18,075 --> 00:31:18,643
FROM THE SHERIFF.

1036
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:20,244
NUMBER ONE, HE SAID HE COULDN'T 

1037
00:31:20,244 --> 00:31:22,714
BE SURE THAT THERE WAS AUTOMATIC

1038
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,816
WEAPONS BUT HE HAD THOSE BUMP 

1039
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:27,952
STOCKS WHICH CAN CONVERT A 

1040
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:29,153
SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPON INTO AN 

1041
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:30,121
AUTOMATIC WEAPON.

00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:31,555
ALSO CONFIRMING THERE ARE 

1043
00:31:31,555 --> 00:31:32,156
CAMERAS IN THE ROOM. 

1044
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:35,293
>> HE IS CONFIRMING SOME OF THE 

1045
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:38,296
CRITICAL FACTS WE'VE BEEN 

1046
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:38,563
REPORTING.

1047
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,764
THE BUMP STOCKS ALLOW AN ASSAULT

1048
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:42,166
RIFLE TO FUNCTION ALMOST LIKE A 

1049
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,201
MACHINE GUN, THE AMOUNT OF 

1050
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:44,435
BULLETS THAT COME OUT THEY COME 

1051
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,637
OUT SO MUCH MORE QUICKLY.

1052
00:31:46,637 --> 00:31:47,905
ALSO WE HAVE REPORTING TONIGHT 

1053
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:49,807

OUTSIDE OF THE ROOM AS WELL AS 

1055
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,643
THE INFORMATION THAT WE BROKE 

1056
00:31:52,643 --> 00:31:53,944
YESTERDAY ABOUT A CAMERA BEING 

1057
00:31:53,944 --> 00:31:54,545
INSIDE THE ROOM.

1058
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:57,115
THE CAMERA OUTSIDE OF THE ROOM 

1059
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:57,782
ACCORDING TO A SOURCE WOULD HAVE

1060
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:59,950
ALLOWED THE SUSPECT TO MONITOR 

1061
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:02,086
POLICE POTENTIALLY AS THEY WERE 

1062
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:02,419
APPROACHING. 

1063
00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:02,887
>> YEAH. 

1064
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:04,655
>> ONE SOURCE SAID THEY'VE NEVER

1065
00:32:04,655 --> 00:32:06,290
SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN TERMS

1066
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,525
OF THE PLANNING AND THE 

1067
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:08,358
METICULOUS PLANNING INVOLVED. 

1068
00:32:08,358 --> 00:32:09,994
>> HE COULD SEE WHEN THEY WERE 

1069
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:11,229
COMING, HOW MUCH TIME HE HAD, 

1070
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:12,430
BRIAN ROSS, LOTS OF QUESTIONS AS

1071
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:16,534
WELL ABOUT THE ROOMMATE, MARILOU

1072
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:17,435
DANLEY, SHERIFF SAYING SHE IS 

1073
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,338
STILL IN THE PHILIPPINES, THEY 

1074
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:20,938
HOPE TO GET MORE INFORMATION 

1075
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:21,973
FROM HER SOON.

1076
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:23,174
MOST INTERESTINGLY ASKED IF SHE 

1077
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:25,076
IS A SUSPECT HE SAID CURRENTLY A

1078
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:25,742
PERSON OF INTEREST. 

1079
00:32:25,742 --> 00:32:26,844
>> THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE 

1080
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:28,746
FROM BEING JUST A HELPFUL 

1081
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:29,013
WITNESS.

1082
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:30,614
SHE IS LABELED NOW A PERSON OF 

1083
00:32:30,614 --> 00:32:32,083
INTEREST WHICH IN LAW 

1084
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:32,816
ENFORCEMENT TERMS MEANS SHE IS 

1085
00:32:32,816 --> 00:32:34,185
NOT QUITE A SUSPECT BUT SHE IS 

1086
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:35,820
NOT OFF THE HOOK, EITHER, 

1087
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,421
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THE 

1088
00:32:37,421 --> 00:32:38,422
DISCOVERY OF SO MANY WEAPONS IN 

1089
00:32:38,422 --> 00:32:40,157
THE HOME THEY SHARED IN 

1090
00:32:40,157 --> 00:32:42,159
MESQUITE, NEVADA, AND THE 

1091
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,160
EXPLOSIVES AND AMMUNITION ALL 

1092
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,829
RAISE THE QUESTION OF HOW COULD 

1093
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:46,497
SHE NOT KNOW SOMETHING WAS GOING

1094
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:46,663
ON. 

1095
00:32:46,663 --> 00:32:48,432
>> MATT GUTMAN, THE QUESTIONS 

1096
00:32:48,432 --> 00:32:51,402
ALSO ABOUT THOSE FINAL 48 HOURS 

1097
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:53,270
AND THE QUESTIONS ABOUT IF THAT 

1098
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,739
CAMERA ACTUALLY CAPTURED THE 

1099
00:32:55,739 --> 00:32:58,342
SHOOTING ITSELF.

1100
00:32:58,342 --> 00:32:59,510
>> Reporter: WE DON'T KNOW THAT 

1101
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,412
JUST YET, GEORGE, THE FBI HAS 

1102
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:02,380
POSSESSION OF THOSE TAPES, THEY 

1103
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,715
ARE OBVIOUSLY GOING TO DO A VERY

1104
00:33:04,715 --> 00:33:06,050
THOROUGH FORENSIC CHECK OVER 

1105
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,618
THEM, BUT ONE INTERESTING TIDBIT

1106
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:09,086
THAT WE SAW FROM SOME OF THESE 

1107
00:33:09,086 --> 00:33:11,722
NEW IMAGES THAT WE PUT OUT FROM 

1108
00:33:11,722 --> 00:33:13,891
THAT ROOM OR JUST OUTSIDE THE 

1109
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:15,493
ROOM IS THAT HE WAS, IN FACT, 

1110
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,427
USING ROOM SERVICE.

1111
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:17,962
SO THE NOTION IS THAT HE HAD 

1112
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:19,296
SHUT HIMSELF INTO THAT ROOM FOR 

1113
00:33:19,296 --> 00:33:21,665
A COUPLE OF DAYS, WE DO KNOW 

1114
00:33:21,665 --> 00:33:22,967
THAT IT HAD BEEN SERVICED A 

1115
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:23,734
COUPLE OF TIMES.

1116
00:33:23,734 --> 00:33:25,369
THE QUESTION IS HOW WAS HE ABLE 

1117
00:33:25,369 --> 00:33:28,072
TO CONCEAL THAT MASS AMOUNT OF 

1118
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:30,541
WEAPONRY, MORE THAN 20 WEAPONS, 

1119
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:31,642
THOUSANDS OF ROUNDS OF 

1120
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:32,276
AMMUNITION FROM THE PEOPLE WHO 

1121
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:33,744
WERE COMING IN AND OUT OF THE 

1122
00:33:33,744 --> 00:33:34,712
ROOM AND HOW COME NOBODY FOUND 

1123
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:35,446
HIM OUT.

1124
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,281
I KNOW THE SHERIFF LOMBARDO 

1125
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:39,049
COMMENDED THE WORK OF SECURITY 

1126
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:40,718
AT MANDALAY BAY, BUT THESE ARE 

1127
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:41,852
STILL QUESTIONS THAT THIS 

1128
00:33:41,852 --> 00:33:42,786
INVESTIGATION IS REALLY GOING TO

1129
00:33:42,786 --> 00:33:43,921
