It's time to call out Wikileaks
for what it really is:
a non-state hostile intelligence
service often abetted
by state actors like Russia.
But I kind of think
of Iranian compliance
with the nuclear deal
like a bad tenant.
Have any of you ever
had a bad tenant?
You know, they don't
pay their rent.
You call them, and
then they send a check.
And it doesn't clear.
And they send another one.
And then the next day,
there's an old, tired sofa
in the front yard.
You tell them to take it away.
And they drag it to the back.
This is Iranian
compliance today.
So the great public debate is
about whether he is rational
or not, right?
We use this word from
Western philosophy
to try and describe
someone who wouldn't
know Western philosophy
if it hit him in the head.
I'm with the president
nearly every day.
We have 35 or 40
minutes on his schedule.
It almost always runs
long, which is great.
Great questions.
The Russians clearly did
it in the 2016 election.
They did it in the 2012
election, in the 1970s as well.
There were those that seem
aghast and shocked that
the Russians were trying
to impact and adversely --
place the outcome
that they preferred
on American democracy.
They've been at this
a hell of a long time.
We have -- we do
have a special task,
because of the global
nature of what we do.
