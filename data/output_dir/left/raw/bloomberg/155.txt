JANET YELLEN'S RECENT COMMENTS

7
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:14,114
ARE GOOD FOR INVESTORS.

8
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:14,914
CAN THE FUNDAMENTALS IMPROVE

9
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:16,483
ENOUGH TO KEEP THE RALLY GOING?

10
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:19,819
JOE: WALL STREET IS WAITING TO

SOUTH AFRICAN BONDS.

00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,866
THAT IS ONE COUNTRY -- LET'S

50
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,435
LOOK AT THE U.S. FIRST.

51
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,337
LOWER YIELDS ACROSS THE BOARD.

52
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:47,006
WE SEE A PARTICULARLY SHARP DROP

53
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:49,242
ON THE 10 YEAR YIELD.

54
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,511
THE FACT THAT THE U.S. TWO-YEAR

56
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:57,683
INDICATING A FLATTENING.

00:01:57,683 --> 00:01:59,519
FRIDAY AFTER THE FED COMMENTS,

LET'S LOOK AT A ONE-MONTH CHART

61
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:04,190
OF SOUTH AFRICAN BONDS.

62
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:04,757
THAT IS INTERESTING.

63
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:05,992
GROWING ANXIETY ABOUT THE

00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:09,362

SITUATION HAS SEEN A SHARP JUMP

66
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,199
IN THE LAST WEEK.

CHANDRA: I'M LOOKING AT

68
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:16,569
CURRENCIES STARTING WITH THE

00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:17,904

00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:18,771
WE HAVE SEEN THE INDEX HIT A TWO

00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:22,008
WEEK HIGH TODAY.

72
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:22,842
WE ARE PRETTY MUCH UNCHANGED AT

73
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:23,810
THE MOMENT.

74
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,744
YOU CAN SEE THE DOLLAR OVER THE

75
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,679
PAST TWO DAYS.

76
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:30,750
YOU CAN SEE THE SPIKE ON FRIDAY

77
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,451
AFTER STAN FISHER SPOKE

78
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:34,687
FOLLOWING JANET YELLEN'S SPEECH.

00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,689
YOU CAN SEE IT UP .9% OVER TWO

80
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:37,090
DAYS.

81
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,691
I WANT TO LOOK AT THE YEN.

82
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:41,661
WE ARE SEEING A STRONGER DOLLAR.

83
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:46,666
THE YEN WEAKENING AGAINST THE

84
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,501
DOLLAR FOR A FOURTH DAY AFTER

85
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,270
BANK OF JAPAN GOVERNOR KURODA

86
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,806
REITERATED HIS READINESS TO EASE

87
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:57,911
MONETARY POLICY.

88
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:02,949
KEEPING AN EYE ON THE REAL AS

89
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,084
WELL, IT IS THE BEST-PERFORMING

90
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,019
EMERGING-MARKET CURRENCY AGAINST

91
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,121
THE DOLLAR TODAY.

92
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,989
UP 1%.

93
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:15,361
JOE: ON THE COMMODITIES FRONT,

94
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,195
LET'S CHECK OUT GOLD WHICH HAS

95
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,330
BEEN ON A LOSING STREAK LATELY.

96
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,131
IF WE LOOK AT A CHART OVER THE

97
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:22,101
LAST MONTH, HERE IS A ONE-YEAR

98
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:23,536
CHART.

99
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,370
WE'VE HAD A BIG RALLY SINCE

100
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,371
DECEMBER.

101
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,373
BUT WE HAVE TOPPED OUT LATELY.

102
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,241
WE HAVE NOT MADE A NEW HIGH IN A

103
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,443
WHILE.

104
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:31,277
OVER THE LAST MONTH, A BIT OF A

105
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:33,580
LOSING STREAK.

106
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,414
GOLD HAVING A SEVEN-DAY LOSING

107
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,549
STREAK.

108
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,350
AFTER A TORRID START, GOLD IS

109
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,784
FADING.

110
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,385
MATT: THOSE ARE THE MARKET

111
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,421
MINUTES WE ARE LOOKING AT.

112
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,423
WE WANT TO GET INTO THE DEEP

113
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:44,290
DIVES AND TAKE A LOOK INTO THE

114
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,158
BLOOMBERG.

115
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:49,929
I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE FUNCTIONS

116
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:54,967
YOU CAN PULL UP BY LOOKING, FOR

117
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:55,735
ME IT IS THE BOTTOM RIGHT-HAND

118
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,504
CORNER.

119
00:03:58,504 --> 00:03:59,305
FOR YOU, THE BOTTOM LEFT-HAND

120
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:00,206
CORNER OF YOUR SCREEN.

121
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,008
I HAVE ONE ON OIL WHICH I THINK

122
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:06,713
IS GREAT.

123
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:07,447
THE ECONOMIST AT BLOOMBERG

124
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:08,181
INTELLIGENCE SENT ME THIS.

125
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,183
YOU SEE THE DIFFERENT OPEC

126
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,385
COUNTRIES AND THEIR PRODUCTION

127
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:13,219
GOING BACK TO THE 1990'S.

128
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,988
ONLY THE WHITE LINE, WHICH IS

129
00:04:15,988 --> 00:04:17,857
SAUDI ARABIA, THE ORANGE LINE

130
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:21,994
WHICH IS A ROCK -- IN IRAQ, AND

131
00:04:21,994 --> 00:04:23,896
THE BLUE LINE WHICH IS A RUN,

132
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:27,567
HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT JUMPS UP.

133
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:32,805
IRAN COMING BACK TO NORMAL.

134
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:33,639
IRAQ IS THE BEGINNER AMONG THE

135
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,574
OPEC COUNTRIES.

136
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,276
YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THE DIFFERENT

137
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,377
MARKET SHARES THERE.

138
00:04:38,377 --> 00:04:40,813
YOU SAW IT FOR A BRIEF MOMENT.

139
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:41,681
IT IS INTERESTING TO LOOK AT THE

140
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:42,482
BREAKUP OF THE OPEC COUNTRIES.

141
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,818
JOE: DEFINITELY.

142
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:46,719
I'M LOOKING AT THE CORRELATION

143
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,656
BETWEEN TWO E.T.F. AND I THINK

144
00:04:50,656 --> 00:04:51,390
IT SAYS A LOT ABOUT WHAT IS

145
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,091
GOING ON IN THE MARKET NOW.

146
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:55,495
THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE SB

147
00:04:55,495 --> 00:05:00,533
PY AND TLT.

148
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:07,140
THIS IS A 90-DAY CORRELATION.

149
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,940
THEY ARE THE MOST POSITIVELY

150
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,941
CORRELATED IN FIVE YEARS.

151
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:09,742
WHEN EVERYTHING IS CORRELATED

152
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:13,646
TOGETHER LIKE THIS, IT HAS LOTS

153
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,282
OF IMPLICATIONS FOR THE MARKET.

154
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:17,083
IT MAKES IT HARD TO DIVERSIFY

155
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:17,884
WHEN BONDS AND STOCKS ARE DOING

156
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:18,951
THE SAME THING.

157
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:19,752
YOU GET NO DIVERSIFICATION IN

158
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:20,953
YOUR PORTFOLIO.

159
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:21,854
IT SHOWS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE

160
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:24,157
FED.

161
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:24,957
TODAY WE SAW BONDS AND STOCKS

162
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:25,758
RALLY AT THE SAME TIME.

163
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:28,694
FRIDAY WE SAW BONDS AND STOCKS

164
00:05:28,694 --> 00:05:31,831
SELL OFF SIGNIFICANTLY AT THE

165
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,799
SAME TIME.

166
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:37,069
WHEN THE ONLY VARIABLE IN THE

167
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:37,870
MARKET SEEMS TO BE THE TIMING OF

168
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,905
THE FED, YOU GET EVERYTHING ELSE

169
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,640
RALLYING OR DECLINING AT THE

170
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,176
SAME TIME.

171
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,010
WE ARE GOING TO KEEP AN EYE ON

172
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:44,710
THAT CORRELATION.

173
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,812
CHANDRA: BY CHART SHOWS A

174
00:05:46,812 --> 00:05:47,880
DIVISION BETWEEN WALL STREET AND

175
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,483
MAIN STREET.

176
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:51,317
IT IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS

177
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:54,787
HAS HAPPENED.

178
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:55,555
I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING

179
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:56,222
BECAUSE IT IS LOOKING AT

180
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,624
VOLATILITY.

181
00:05:58,624 --> 00:05:59,492
WE HAVE THE CALMEST STOCK MARKET

182
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:00,059
IN FIVE DECADES.

183
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:01,160
THE ON THE SURFACE, WE ARE

184
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,763
SEEING A TO VIRGINS IN SENTIMENT

185
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:07,300
-- BEYOND THE SURFACE, WE ARE

186
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,200
SEEING A DIVERGENCE IN

187
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,536
SENTIMENT.

188
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,337
INDIVIDUALS ARE LOADING UP ON

189
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:14,340
PROTECTED OPTIONS AND EQUITY

190

FUNDS.

191
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:18,411
WE HAVE THE WHITE LINE RISING.

192
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:21,314
THIS AMOUNTS TO A STOCK MARKET

193
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,482
SHORT ON THE PART OF RETAIL

194
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:24,517
INVESTORS.

195
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:27,119
IF WE LOOK AT THE BLUE LINE,

196
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:29,188
THESE ARE THE FEATURES POSITIONS

197
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:33,359
-- FEATURES -- FUTURES

198
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:33,793
POSITIONS.

199
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,629
SMALLER INVESTORS ARE EMBRACING

200
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,999
THEM.

201
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,634
INTERESTING TO SEE THIS

202
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:44,537
DIVERGENCE OR SMART MONEY IS

203
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,572
GOING TOWARDS THE VIX STOCK

204
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,006
MARKET.

205
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:51,010
MATT: WE HAVE TO USE THE BUNNY

206
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,745

LAST TIME THIS HAPPENED IN 2015.

DIVIDENDS, STOCKS ARE PUSHING

00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,930
HIGHER CURRENTLY ABOVE THE

214
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,898
10-MONTH MOVING AVERAGE.

215
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,399
ARE STOCKS GETTING TOO

216
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:13,866
EXPENSIVE?

JOINING US NOW IS MEB FABER.

THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

219
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:23,976
U.S. STOCKS ARE STILL VERY CLOSE

220
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:25,244
TO ALL-TIME HIGHS.

221
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:28,080
CAN THEY KEEP PUSHING HIGHER?

222
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,882
HAVE THE VALUATIONS GOTTEN TOO

223
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:30,282
MUCH?

224
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:33,252
>> THE WORLD LOOKS A LOT LIKE

225
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:34,020
THE WAY IT HAS BEEN THE LAST

226
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,288
SEAT OF TIMES I'VE BEEN ON THE

227
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,023
SHOW, SO GREAT TO BE BACK.

228
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:41,360
U.S. STOCKS STILL EXPENSIVE.

229
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,194
THEY ARE THE SECOND BEST OF FOUR

230
00:07:42,194 --> 00:07:44,964
ENVIRONMENTS TO BE IN WHICH IS

231
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:45,665
EXPENSIVE AND GOING UP.

232
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,133
THAT IS OK.

233
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,969
THE REST OF THE WORLD, WHEEZING

234
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,138
EQUITIES IN PARTICULAR, LOOKS

235
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:52,638
MUCH BETTER.

236
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,973
A LOT OF THE INVESTMENTS WE

237
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:57,143
TALKED ABOUT, EMERGING MARKETS

238
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,012
AND FOREIGN MARKETS IN GENERAL,

239
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,247
USUALLY THE REALLY CHEAP STUFF,

240
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:04,217
BRAZIL EQUITY MARKETS UP ABOUT

241
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,219
60% THIS YEAR.

242
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:09,789
THE RUSSIAN MARKET UP ABOUT 25%.

243
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:10,623
WE THINK THAT IS A MUCH BETTER

244
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:11,390
PLACE TO BE THAN U.S. STOCKS.

245
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,527
JOE: I HAVE THIS CHART ON MY

246
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:17,330
BLOOMBERG.

247
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,067
IT COMPARES THE EMERGING MARKETS

248
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:25,471
E.T.F. VERSUS THE SPY.

249
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,873
YOU CAN SEE IT UNDERPERFORMED

250
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:28,674
FOR YEARS BUT HAS BEEN PICKING

251
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,075
UP LATELY.

252
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,343
STILL IT HAS HARDLY RECOUPED ANY

253
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:33,511
OF THE RELATIVE LOSSES SINCE THE

254
00:08:33,511 --> 00:08:36,816
PEAK IN 2010.

255
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:37,582
DO YOU SEE OVERALL EMERGING

256
00:08:37,582 --> 00:08:39,585
MARKETS HAVING MUCH FURTHER TO

257
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:40,352
RUN RELATIVE TO U.S. EQUITIES?

258
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:44,423
>> THE END OF THE YEAR WAS THIS

259
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,692
PERFECT ONE SIDE WITH MANY YEARS

260
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,595
OF UNDERPERFORMANCE -- COINCIDE

261
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:50,196
WITH MANY YEARS OF

262
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,098
UNDERPERFORMANCE.

263
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:52,965
FINALLY GOT TO CHEAP VALUATIONS.

264
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:55,501
NOBODY WANTS THEM.

265
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:56,569
THAT SETS THE STAGE FOR FUTURE

266
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,205
BULL MARKETS.

267
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,039
THEY ONLY OUTPERFORM EACH OTHER

268
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,208
ABOUT HALF THE TIME.

269
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:02,942
THE U.S. HAS BEEN CRUSHING

270
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,044
EVERYONE ELSE SINCE THE GLOBAL

271
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,178
FINANCIAL CRISIS.

272
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:06,979
YOU ARE STARTING TO SEE THE

273
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:10,283
SHIFT RIGHT AROUND JANUARY.

274
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,051
FOREIGN MARKETS STARTED TO TAKE

275
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,986
LEADERSHIP, PARTICULARLY

276
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,121
EMERGING MARKETS.

277
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,957
SOME OF THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES

278
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,091
ARE STILL LAGGARDS.

279
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,993
ITALY, GREECE, SPAIN.

280
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:25,331
WE THINK MANY MORE YEARS OF

281
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:26,065
OUTPERFORMANCE, DOUBLE-DIGIT

282
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,534
RETURNS IN EMERGING MARKETS IN

283
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:29,401
PARTICULAR AND LOW SIGNAL DIGITS

284
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:29,869
FOR THE U.S.

WHICH IS KIND OF A BIG DEAL.

288
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:39,979
IT SAID IT IS NO LONGER PURSUING

289
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,415
A COMBINATION WITH HERSHEY.

290
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,249
IT SAYS IT IS DISAPPOINTED WITH

291
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:47,319
THE OUTCOME BUT CITING RECENT

292
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:48,788
HOLDER DEVELOPMENTS AT HERSHEY.

293
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:49,655
IT SAYS THERE IS NO ACTIONABLE

294
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:50,590
PATH FORWARD.

295
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,360
IT IS GOING TO CONTINUE

296
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,060
EXECUTIVE PLANS TO BOOST

297
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,729
SHAREHOLDER VALUE, PROBABLY A

298
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:57,530
GOOD IDEA SINCE THAT IS THE MAIN

299
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,864
JOB.

300
00:09:58,864 --> 00:09:59,899
THIS SAYS THEY ARE NO LONGER

301
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:00,733
PURSUING A COMBINATION WITH

302
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:01,667
HERSHEY.

303
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,369
VERY INTERESTING NEWS OUT OF

THOSE SHARES AFTER HOURS, WE SAW

306
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:14,280
A BIG SPIKE AND A RECOVERY.

307
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,849
NOT A LOT OF MOVEMENT IN SHARES.

308
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,751
JOE: PLUNGING OVER 8% RIGHT NOW

309
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,355
ON THE NEWS.

310
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:23,088
OBVIOUSLY, THE LOSS OF A

311
00:10:23,088 --> 00:10:24,056
POTENTIAL ACQUIRER HITTING THEIR

312
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:27,360
SHARES.

313
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,160
MATT: EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD

314
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,561
EXPECT.

315
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:33,265
THERE ARE NOT A TON  OF

316
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:33,999
SHARES TRADED AFTER HOURS IN

317
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:35,001
HERSHEY.

318
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:37,403
YOU CAN SEE THE CONTRACTS AND

319
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,337
HOW MANY ARE TRADED RIGHT NOW.

320
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:39,038
VERY INTERESTING NEWS.

321
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:42,041
WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR IT.

I WILL ASK YOU ABOUT THE U.S.

323
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,545
CONSUMER.

324
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:47,346
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT CONSUMER

325
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,181
STOCKS.

326
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:55,354
THEY ARE IN A RUT RIGHT HERE.

327
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:57,923
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE FACT

328
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:00,359
THE U.S. CONSUMER SEEMS TO BE

329
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:05,331
ALMOST RUNNING ON EMPTY, KIND OF

330
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,298
OUT OF GAS ALMOST.

331
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:11,103
>> IN LOS ANGELES, HOUSING

332
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:11,871
PRICES LOOK LIKE 2008 NEVER

333
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:15,140
HAPPENED.

334
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:15,941
THIS IS THE THING YOU START TO

335
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:18,510
SEE IN THE BULL MARKET IN YEAR

336
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,311
SEVEN OR EIGHT WHERE RETURNS ARE

337
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:20,679
GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE THE

338
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,413
SENTIMENT IS STARTING TO GET

339
00:11:21,413 --> 00:11:21,881
HIGH AGAIN.

340
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,516
PEOPLE IN GENERAL, CONSUMER

341
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:28,020
DISCRETIONARY STOCKS FOR

342
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,587
 EXAMPLE REALLY

343
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:29,722
EXPENSIVE.

344
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:32,391
A LOT OF THE CONSUMER FOCUSED

345
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,292
BECAUSE OF THE SEARCH FOR YIELD,

346
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,795
PEOPLE PUSHING THE YIELDS DOWN.

347
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,496
A LOT OF THESE CONSUMER STOCKS

348
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:40,199
IS A TERRIBLE PLACE TO BE.

349
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,033
WANT TO GET AWAY FROM THOSE AND

350
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:41,734
RUN AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE.

351
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,904
CHANDRA: I SHOWED A CHART

352
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:52,812
EARLIER ON THE DIVERGENCE

353
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,881
WITH INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS

354
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,950
BAILING OUT WHILE SMALLER

355
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,052
INVESTORS HAVE BEEN EMBRACING

356
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:05,323
THEM.

357
00:12:05,323 --> 00:12:07,092
THEY HAVE BEEN SHORTING THE

358
00:12:07,092 --> 00:12:07,626
STOCK MARKET.

359
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:08,093
WHO IS RIGHT?

360
00:12:08,093 --> 00:12:12,631
>> WE FIND INSTITUTIONAL

361
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:13,465
INVESTORS OFTEN BEHAVE AS POORLY

362
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:13,966
AS INDIVIDUALS.

363
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:14,733
THEY USE A LOT MORE RIGOROUS

364
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:17,269
TERMS FOR IT, BUT THEY MAKE A

365
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:18,137
LOT OF THE SAME MISTAKES.

366
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:21,140
BUILDING A GLOBAL PORTFOLIO,

367
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:21,941
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS YOU

368
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:22,441
WANT TO INCLUDE.

369
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,276
YOU WANT TO GET RID OF HOME

370
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,344
COUNTRY BIAS.

371
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,413
THAT HAPPENS NOT JUST IN THE

372
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,247
U.S. BUT IN EVERY COUNTRY AROUND

373
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,249
THE WORLD.

374
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,052
EVERY COUNTRY INVESTOR PUTS TOO

375
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,654
MUCH IN THEIR OWN STOCKS.

376
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:36,488
BUILDING A PORTFOLIO, YOU HAVE

377
00:12:36,488 --> 00:12:38,758
TO HAVE A GLOBAL APPROACH.

THE THINGS THEY DON'T DO WELL IS

531
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:05,937
IT IS TYPICALLY AN AGGRESSIVE

532
00:20:05,937 --> 00:20:08,640

585

00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:48,966
KIND OF SHAREHOLDER ACTIVITY

753
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:53,738
COULD HAVE LED TO THIS CHANGE.

754
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:54,605
I SAW THAT HERSHEY IS CONTROLLED

755
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:57,475
BY THIS TRUST THAT WAS UNDER

756
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,743
FIRE FOR LAVISH SPENDING.

757
00:32:58,743 --> 00:32:59,510
THERE WAS AN INVESTIGATION.

758
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,511
THEY PROMISED TO DO BETTER.

759
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:05,550
WHAT IS THE  STORY WITH

760
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,552
THE OWNERS OF HERSHEY?

761
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:20,164
>> RIP GENE WILDER INDEED.

762
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:20,998
FITTING THIS NEWS WOULD COME ON

763
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:22,000
THE SAME DAY.

764
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,833
HERSHEY HAS A NORMAL CORPORATE

765
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:25,770
BOARD AS EVERY COMPANY DOES.

766
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,606
BUT IT ALSO HAS A TRUST CHARGED

767
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:29,473
WITH LOOKING AFTER THE INTERESTS

768
00:33:29,473 --> 00:33:33,277
OF HERSHEY THE TOWN.

769
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:34,111
THEY GET THE ULTIMATE CALL ON

770
00:33:34,111 --> 00:33:34,845
WHETHER OR NOT THIS COMPANY

771
00:33:34,845 --> 00:33:36,147
GETS.

772
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:36,981
SOLD EVEN IF THE BOARD APPROVED

773
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:38,816
THE DEAL, IT IS UP TO THE

774
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:44,255
TRUST TO DECIDE IF THE BOARD

775
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:45,123
MADE THE RIGHT DECISION.

776
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:46,991
IT NEVER MADE IT THAT FAR.

777
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:49,794
MATT: MONDELEZ WOULD HAVE TO

778
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:50,995
MAKE IT VERY APPEALING TO THE

779
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:54,632
PEOPLE TO WHOM THE TRUST REPORTS

780
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:57,068
FOR THE TRUST TO THINK ABOUT IT

781
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:59,904
BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT THE TOWN

782
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:00,504
IN PENNSYLVANIA.

783
00:34:00,504 --> 00:34:08,913
>> IT IS AN AMORPHOUS CONCEPT ON

784
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:10,514
WHICH INTEREST THEY ARE SERVING.

785
00:34:10,514 --> 00:34:11,215
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF

786
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,818
CRITICISM BECAUSE THE TRUST IS

787
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:16,020
OFTEN UNDER FIRE FOR APPARENTLY

788
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,188
SERVING THEIR OWN SELF INTEREST,

789
00:34:18,188 --> 00:34:18,989
SPENDING LOTS OF MONEY ON THEIR

790
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:23,594
OWN ACTIVITIES, NOT NECESSARILY

791
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:24,428
BEST FOR THE BIGGER CONCEPT OF

792
00:34:24,428 --> 00:34:26,330
WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF

793
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:26,964
THE TOWN OF HERSHEY.

794
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:29,100
>> WHAT HAPPENS NEXT FOUR

795
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,467
MONDELEZ?

796
00:34:30,467 --> 00:34:31,436
WILL THEY LOOK AT OTHER

797
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:31,969
ACQUISITIONS?

798
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,539
>> I THINK THEY WILL LOOK AT

799
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:39,743
OTHER ACQUISITIONS.

800
00:34:39,743 --> 00:34:40,578
THEY ARE ALSO SEEN AS A TARGET

801
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,978
SO IT IS POSSIBLE SOMEONE BIGGER

802
00:34:41,978 --> 00:34:45,550
AND BETTER WILL GO AFTER THEM.

803
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,351
THIS DEAL I'M SURE WAS MOTIVATED

804
00:34:48,351 --> 00:34:49,487
FOR STRATEGIC REASONS.

805
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,355
THERE HAS BEEN WHISPERING SINCE

806
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:53,724
IT BECAME PUBLIC THAT THEY

807
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:54,458
POTENTIALLY WERE DOING A

808
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:55,025
DEFENSIVE MOVE.

809
00:34:55,025 --> 00:34:58,629
>> ED HAMMOND, THANK YOU VERY

810
00:34:58,629 --> 00:34:59,096
MUCH INDEED.

811
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:01,766
MATT: LET'S GET A QUICK RECAP OF

812
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,835
TODAY'S MARKET ACTION.

813
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:06,704
STOCKS SHOWED GAINS TODAY.

814
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:08,172
THE BIGGEST GAIN FOR THE S&P 500

815
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:10,708
SINCE AUGUST FOR.

816
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:12,176
JOE, THE BIGGEST GAIN IN A

817
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:13,744
MONTH.

818
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:14,145
.5%.

819
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:19,984
JOE: THAT IS A REMARKABLE FACT.

820
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:20,785
I THINK WE ARE ON 35 STRAIGHT

821
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,654
DAYS.

822
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:27,191
MATT: I THINK IT IS 36.

823
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:27,992
I HAVE A CHART ABIGAIL DOOLITTLE

824
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:28,626
HAS BEEN SHOWN TODAY.

825
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:29,794
IT SHOWS YOU THIS RANGE.

826
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:35,032
THE S&P HAS NOT MOVED TO A 1% OR

827
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:37,435
GREATER RANGE IN 36 DAYS.

828
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:38,235
THE RANGE IS BROADENING SO WE

829
00:35:38,235 --> 00:35:38,836
ARE GETTING THERE.

830
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:41,405
BUT IT HAS NOT MOVED OUT.

831
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:42,239
DO YOU WANT TO SHOW THE CHART I

832
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:42,606
HAVE?

833
00:35:42,606 --> 00:35:44,976
JOE: THERE IT IS.

834
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:48,279
THAT IS A GORGEOUS CHART.

835
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:49,147
"WHAT'D YOU MISS?"

836
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,749
THE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF

837
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:56,120
BRAZIL'S BENDED PRESIDENT IS

838
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:00,291
ENTERING -- SUSPENDED PRESIDENT

839
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:02,093
IS ENTERING ITS FINAL PHASES.

840
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:05,563
SHE SAID SHE DID NOT COMMIT ANY

841
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:06,397
CRIME CALLING HER IMPEACHMENT "A

842
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:07,165
POLITICAL DEATH PENALTY."

843
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:15,573
>> TWICE, I CAME CLOSE TO DEATH.

844
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,341
ONCE WHEN FOR DAYS I WAS

845
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:21,846
TORTURED THAT MADE ME DOUBT

846
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:22,546
HUMANITY AND LIFE ITSELF.

847
00:36:22,546 --> 00:36:24,382
WHEN A SERIOUS ILLNESS ALMOST

848
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:27,451
MADE MY LIFE SHORTER.

849
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:28,252
TODAY I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE

850
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:29,487
DEATH OF DEMOCRACY.

851
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:34,091
JOE: LET'S BRING IN JULIA LEITE

852
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:35,760
FOR THE LATEST.

853
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,896
DRAMATIC STUFF.

854
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:39,764
DOES SHE HAVE ANY POLITICAL LIFE

855
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,599
AT ALL OR IS THIS A DONE DEAL?

856
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:46,804
>> THIS IS SEEN AS A DONE DEAL.

857
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:49,140
MOST OF THE NEWSPAPER POLLS HAVE

858
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,943
AROUND 52 SENATORS VOTING FOR

859
00:36:52,943 --> 00:36:55,012
IMPEACHMENT AND 10 UNDECIDED.

860
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:56,814
THEY ONLY NEED 54 TO IMPEACH.

861
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:59,683
THIS IS SEEN BY HER ALLIES AS A

862
00:36:59,683 --> 00:37:00,151
DONE DEAL.

863
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:00,985
SHE'S GOING TO BE IMPEACHED THIS

864
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:03,321
WEEK.

865
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:04,121
JOE: IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE A

866
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:04,855
DEATH SENTENCE.

867
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:07,858
ONE OF THE SENATORS WHO WILL BE

868
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:11,162
VOTING HIMSELF WAS A BRAZILIAN

869
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:12,129
PRESIDENT WHO WAS IMPEACHED.

870
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:14,165
HER CAREER COULD GO ON.

871
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:17,134
>> THAT IS RIGHT.

872
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:21,172
HE WAS IMPEACHED IN 1992 AND WAS

873
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:21,972
OUT OF THE POLITICAL SPHERE FOR

874
00:37:21,972 --> 00:37:27,144
EIGHT YEARS.

875
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:27,711
HE HAS BEEN BACK.

876
00:37:27,711 --> 00:37:28,245
HE IS A SENATOR.

877
00:37:28,245 --> 00:37:29,947
HE SPOKE ON THE FIRST

878
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,049
IMPEACHMENT VOTE AND IS VOTING

879
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:34,418
THIS WEEK AS WELL.

880
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:37,888
>> WE HAVE SEEN STUNNING GAINS

881
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:46,163
IN THE RUN-UP TO THIS.

882
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:46,997
IS THIS OPTIMISM IN THE STOCK

883
00:37:46,997 --> 00:37:47,631
MARKET BECAUSE OF THE

884
00:37:47,631 --> 00:37:50,468
POSSIBILITY OF HER GOING OR IS

885
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:55,506
IT ABOUT THE ACTUAL FUTURE BETS

886
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:57,842
ON BRAZIL'S ECONOMY?

887
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:00,778
>> WE HEAR BOTH THINGS.

888
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,547
WE ALSO HEAR COMMODITIES RALLY

889
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:05,082
AND LOW INTEREST RATES ABROAD.

890
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:07,151
THERE IS A LARGE PORTION OF

891
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:07,852
INVESTORS THAT STILL SAY

892
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:08,953
WHATEVER COMES AFTER WILL BE

893
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:14,858
BETTER.

894
00:38:14,858 --> 00:38:15,693
THEY WILL HAVE TROUBLE PASSING

895
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:16,494
REFORMS EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A

896
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:17,928
LOT OF OPTIMISM HE WILL MANAGE

897
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:19,230
TO GET SOME DONE.

898
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,432
INVESTORS KNOW IT IS DIFFICULT.

899
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:22,299
BRAZIL HAS A DIFFICULT POLITICAL

900
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:23,034
SYSTEM.

901
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:24,869
WE HAVE OVER 30 PARTIES SO THERE

902
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:27,071
IS A LOT OF NEGOTIATING THAT

903
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:27,605
NEEDS TO GO ON.

904
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:29,039
JOE: I WANT TO EXPAND ON THAT

905
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:31,108
QUESTION FURTHER.

906
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:36,013
ASSUMING SHE IS IMPEACHED AND IS

907
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:37,781
OFFICIALLY REMOVED FROM OFFICE,

908
00:38:37,781 --> 00:38:41,085
DOES THAT AID IN THE PROCESS OF

909
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:44,689
POLITICAL REFORM AT ALL?

910
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:45,489
IS THAT ON A TOTALLY SEPARATE

911
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,223
TRACK WITH ITS OWN DYNAMICS?

912
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:54,365
>> THE HOPE IS IT WILL MAKE --

913
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:55,099
GIVE HIM A MORE LEGITIMATE

914
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:55,833
GOVERNMENT AND MORE SWAY IN

915
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:56,467
NEGOTIATIONS.

916
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:58,168
POLITICAL REFORM PROPOSALS HAVE

917
00:38:58,168 --> 00:39:00,504
BEEN PUT ASIDE FOR THE TIME

918
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:01,572
BEING.

919
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:05,276
WE ARE TALKING MOSTLY ABOUT

920
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:06,110
PENSION REFORM, SOCIAL SECURITY

921
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,611
REFORM, TAX REFORM.

922
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:09,046
SOME TALK ABOUT LABOR LAW

923
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:10,848
REFORM.

924
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,715
POLITICAL REFORM IS LIKELY TO BE

925
00:39:11,715 --> 00:39:14,518
EVEN MORE COMPLICATED AND IS NOT

926
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:15,185
ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW.

927
00:39:15,185 --> 00:39:18,722
MATT: WHEN IS THE LAST TIME WE

928
00:39:18,722 --> 00:39:20,958
ARE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT THIS?

929
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:21,825
THE LAST TIME YOU'RE GOING TO

930
00:39:21,825 --> 00:39:26,597
HAVE TO REPORT ON HER FOR AT

931
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:27,197
LEAST EIGHT YEARS?

932
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:29,700
>> THAT IS HARD TO KNOW.

933
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,170
THIS WEEK, WE WILL BE

934
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,705
REPORTING ON HER A LOT.

935
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,440
SHE COULD APPEAL.

936
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,143
THIS COULD GO ON FOR A WHILE.

937
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:40,010
WE WILL SEE WHAT SHE DECIDES TO

938
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:40,344
DO.

939
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,880
MATT: MAYBE A BIT OF A

940
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,480
NEVER-ENDING STORY.

941
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,983
>> BUT ONE THAT WE LOVE

942
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:46,917
FOLLOWING.

943
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:48,452
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

944
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:52,590
MATT: STILL AHEAD IN OUR OWN

945
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,792
POLITICAL SAGA, HILLARY CLINTON

946
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:56,994
IS WORRYING SOME DEMOCRATS BY

947
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:59,830
TRYING TO SEPARATE DONALD TRUMP

948
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,031
FROM HIS PARTY.

949
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:03,134
ARE THEY TRULY TWO DIFFERENT

950
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,068
ENTITIES?

951
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,203
WE GOT TO WASHINGTON NEXT.

952
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:07,004
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

♪

954
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:29,647
JOE: "WHAT'D YOU MISS?"

955
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:30,514
HILLARY CLINTON IS TRYING TO GET

956
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:31,215
REPUBLICAN VOTERS TO DITCH

957
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,583
DONALD TRUMP ARE LINKING HIM TO

958
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:37,421
-- BY LINKING HIM TO OTHERS

959
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:38,188
OUTSIDE THE MAINSTREAM OF THE

960
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:39,189
REPUBLICAN PARTY.

961
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:49,066
FOR MORE, LET'S BRING IN OUR

962
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:56,139
GUEST.

963
00:42:56,139 --> 00:42:56,940
IS SHE SAYING THIS IS NOT A

964
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,741
TYPICAL REPUBLICAN AND SOMETHING

965
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:58,208
MUCH WORSE?

966
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,343
>> SHE IS TRYING TO WIN OVER A

967
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:01,579
LOT OF INDEPENDENTS AND

968
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,412
REPUBLICANS WHO NOT SURE ABOUT

969
00:43:02,412 --> 00:43:05,549
DONALD TRUMP BY BASICALLY

970
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:06,316
PAINTING HIM AS SOMEONE WAY

971
00:43:06,316 --> 00:43:07,518
OUTSIDE THE MAINSTREAM.

972
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:08,152
NOT A CONSERVATIVE.

973
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:09,420
NOT A REPUBLICAN.

974
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,921
GIVING HIM WIGGLE ROOM TO SAY

975
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,189
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR

976
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:15,726
THE NOMINEE BECAUSE IN HER VIEW,

977
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:16,393
HE IS NOT A MAINSTREAM

978
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:17,595
REPUBLICAN.

979
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,997
IT IS A WAY TO REACH OUT TO

980
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:20,798
CONSTITUENCIES THAT NORMALLY

981
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:21,565
WOULD NOT CONSIDER VOTING FOR

982
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:22,733
HER.

983
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:23,500
BUT BECAUSE HE IS SUCH AN

984
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,469
INCENDIARY CANDIDATE, SOME ARE

985
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:26,303
CONSIDERING NOT VOTING FOR HIM.

986
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:29,239
JOE: ONE OF THE CRITICISMS OF

987
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:33,277
THIS STRATEGY IS YOU GUYS HAVE

988
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,145
BEEN ACCUSING US OF BEING RACIST

989
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:42,353
AND SEXIST AND BIGOTS FOR YEARS.

990
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:43,187
SO WHY SHOULD WE LISTEN TO YOU

991
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:43,954
WHEN YOU SAY THIS ABOUT DONALD

992
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:44,321
TRUMP?

993
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:46,657
HAVE THE DEMOCRATS CREATED A

994
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:48,892
PROBLEM?

995
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:49,726
THERE WAS A SPECIFIC ATTACK ON

996
00:43:49,726 --> 00:43:53,931
POP KRUGMAN -- PAUL KRUGMAN.

997
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:54,698
IS THE BAR HIGH FOR HILLARY

998
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:58,702
CLINTON TO SAY REALLY, THIS IS

999
00:43:58,702 --> 00:43:59,436
ON A LEVEL WE HAVE NOT SEEN

1000
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:00,204
BEFORE FROM PREVIOUS CANDIDATES?

1001
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:01,739
>> THAT IS RIGHT.

1002
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:04,842
NOT ONLY IS THE BAR HIGH, THE

1003
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:06,276
DEMOCRATS ARE RUNNING FOR SEATS

1004
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:09,847
IN CONGRESS AND ARE NOT

1005
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:10,647
COMPLETELY ON BOARD WITH HILLARY

1006
00:44:10,647 --> 00:44:13,517
CLINTON'S STRATEGY BECAUSE THEY

1007
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:15,118
WANT TO TIE THEIR OPPONENTS TO

1008
00:44:15,118 --> 00:44:15,919
DONALD TRUMP AND SAY HE IS VERY

1009
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:19,156
MUCH A FIREBRAND THAT REPRESENTS

1010
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:19,790
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

1011
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:22,559
THEY WANT TO LINK THESE PEOPLE

1012
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:24,595
IN CONGRESS WHO ARE STRUGGLING

1013
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:27,497
IN TIGHT RACES, THEY WANT TO

1014
00:44:27,497 --> 00:44:29,766
MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT ALL

1015
00:44:29,766 --> 00:44:31,168
TRUMP REPRESENTS THE REPUBLICAN

1016
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:31,535
PARTY.

1017
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:36,373
IT IS A THORNY STRATEGY FOR

1018
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:37,774
HILLARY CLINTON BUT SOMETHING

1019
00:44:37,774 --> 00:44:39,009
SHE THINKS SHE NEEDS TO DO TO

1020
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:39,610
WIN THE PRESIDENCY.

1021
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:42,846
>> SPEAKING OF TRUMP, WE HEARD

1022
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:44,882
MORE FROM HIM ABOUT HIS

1023
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:48,385
IMMIGRATION VIEWS TODAY.

1024
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:50,487
TELL US MORE ABOUT THAT.

1025
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:51,188
IT WAS JUST KIND OF ONE

1026
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:54,258
MEANINGFUL CHANGE AND IT RELATED

1027
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:55,058
TO THE MASS DEPORTATION ASPECT.

1028
00:44:55,058 --> 00:44:59,630
>> WE ARE EXPECTING TO HEAR MUCH

1029
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:00,364
MORE FROM DONALD TRUMP ON

1030
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,265
WEDNESDAY WHERE HE SAYS HE WILL

1031
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:03,100
LAY OUT A MAJOR SPEECH ABOUT

1032
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,401
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.

1033
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:07,404
FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS, WE HAVE

1034
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:08,672
BEEN SEEING A LOT OF

1035
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:09,439
BACK-AND-FORTH ABOUT DONALD

1036
00:45:09,439 --> 00:45:11,408
TRUMP'S FINAL PLAN.

1037
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:13,143
THERE IS A LOT OF CONFUSION

1038
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:15,012
ABOUT WHAT HE WANTS TO DO WITH

1039
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:16,914
THE 11 MILLION OR SO

1040
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:18,415
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IN THIS

1041
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:19,750
COUNTRY.

1042
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:20,550
HE HAS NOT BEEN VERY SPECIFIC

1043
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:22,786
ABOUT THAT.

1044
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:23,553
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS

1045
00:45:23,553 --> 00:45:25,255
BUILDING UP AS HE GETS CLOSER TO

1046
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:27,524
THIS WEDNESDAY SPEECH.

1047
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:30,360
HE DOES SAY HE WANTS TO DEPORT

1048
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,094
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE

1049
00:45:31,094 --> 00:45:33,497
HERE ILLEGALLY, SPECIFICALLY

1050
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:34,231
FOCUSING ON PEOPLE WHO HAVE

1051
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,599
COMMITTED CRIMES SINCE THEY HAVE

1052
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:36,800
GOTTEN HERE.

1053
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,601
WE ARE STILL NOT SURE WHAT HE

1054
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:39,202
WAS TO DO WITH THE VAST MAJORITY

1055
00:45:39,202 --> 00:45:42,639
OF PEOPLE HERE, MANY OF WHOM WHO

1056
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:43,440
HAVE BEEN HERE FOR YEARS AND

1057
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:43,774
YEARS.

1058
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:45,509
MATT: GETTING BACK TO THE

1059
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:47,477
CONGRESSIONAL RACES, I WONDER IF

1060
00:45:47,477 --> 00:45:50,347
THERE ARE SPECIAL NUMBERS OF

1061
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:52,616
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES WHO ARE

1062
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:55,853
TRYING TO DISTANCE THEIR

1063
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:57,688
CANDIDACIES FROM THAT OF DONALD

1064
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:59,022
TRUMP.

1065
00:45:59,022 --> 00:45:59,923
DO YOU SEE MORE OF THAT THAN YOU

1066
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,993
NORMALLY WOULD?

1067
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:04,094
REPUBLICAN SAYING I AM A

1068
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,062
REPUBLICAN THAT I DON'T SUPPORT

1069
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:05,629
THIS GUY EITHER?

1070
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:08,765
>> WE HAVE SEEN SOME WHO HAVE

1071
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,434
COME OUT SPECIFICALLY AND SAID

1072
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:11,935
THEY HAD NOT ENDORSED DONALD

1073
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,904
TRUMP.

1074
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:17,141
SOME LIKE SENATOR KIRK HAVE

1075
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:17,874
ENDORSED DONALD TRUMP AND

1076
00:46:17,874 --> 00:46:19,977
RETRACTED THAT ENDORSEMENT.

1077
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:21,645
WE ARE MORE SEEING PEOPLE

1078
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:23,013
KEEPING THEIR MOUTH SHUT AND NOT

1079
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:25,816
ENDORSE DONALD TRUMP OR SPEAK

1080
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:27,017
OUT AGAINST HIM.

1081
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:30,520
THEY WILL NEED HIS CONSTITUENCY

1082
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,856
AND THAT REPUBLICAN BASE TO COME

1083
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:33,657
OUT IF THEY WILL BE ABLE TO WIN

1084
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:37,194
IN COMPETITIVE RACES.

1085
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:38,962
BUT A LOT OF THEM ARE NOT

1086
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:39,730
COMFORTABLE WITH DONALD TRUMP

1087
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:40,630
AND DON'T BELIEVE HE HAS WHAT IT

1088
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:41,264
TAKES TO GET OVER 50%.

1089
00:46:41,264 --> 00:46:44,301
MANY OF THEM ARE NOT SPEAKING

1090
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,068
OUT AGAINST HIM BUT ALSO NOT

1091
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:46,069
APPEARING WITH HIM WHEN HE COMES

1092
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:48,005
TO THEIR STATES AND NOT

1093
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:49,173
ENDORSING HIM.

1094
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:53,210
JOE: BLOOMBERG REPORTED EARLIER

1095
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,480
TRUMP IS SET TO MAKE HIS FIRST

1096
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,280
SPEECH IN FRONT OF AN ALL-BLACK

1097
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,349
AUDIENCE LATER THIS WEEK OR THIS

1098
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:01,552
WEEKEND.

1099
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:02,419
IS HE SERIOUS ABOUT TRYING TO

1100
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:06,123
WIN SOME OF THE BLACK VOTE OR IS

1101
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:07,291
THIS AN ATTEMPT TO POSITION

1102
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:10,327
HIMSELF AS NOT BEING A SCARY

1103
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,262
RACIST, OR SOME OF THOSE

1104
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:16,266
MODERATE SUBURBAN WHITE VOTERS

1105
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:16,933
WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE BE

1106
00:47:16,933 --> 00:47:18,935
SYMPATHETIC TO HIM BUT FIND HIS

1107
00:47:18,935 --> 00:47:21,305
CURRENT FOR TRAIL -- PORTRAYAL

1108
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:23,106
TOO INTOLERABLE?

1109
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:25,542
>> I THINK IT IS A LITTLE OF

1110
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:27,778
BOTH.

1111
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:28,678
HIS POLLING AT LOW SINGLE DIGITS

1112
00:47:28,678 --> 00:47:29,246
WITH BLACK VOTERS.

1113
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:32,783
HE DOES NEED TO DO BETTER IF HE

1114
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:33,583
WILL BE ABLE TO BE COMPETITIVE

1115
00:47:33,583 --> 00:47:35,619
AND SWING STATES.

1116
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:37,120
HE ALSO WANTS TO REASSURE VOTERS

1117
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,555
WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER

1118
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:42,359
HE IS A BIGOT, AS HILLARY

1119
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:45,529
CLINTON HAS CALLED HIM.

1120
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,329
HE WANTS TO REASSURE THEM HE CAN

1121
00:47:46,329 --> 00:47:47,731
BE THE PRESIDENT OF ALL

1122
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:50,634
AMERICANS SO HE WILL GO INTO A

1123
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:51,368
BLACK CHURCH IN SPEAK TO AN

1124
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:54,938
AUDIENCE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE

1125
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:55,705
AUDIENCES HE HAS BEEN SPEAKING

1126
00:47:55,705 --> 00:47:56,139
TO.

1127
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:57,007
HE WANTS TO REASSURE VOTERS WHO

1128
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:59,976
ARE IFFY ON HIM THAT HE CAN

1129
00:47:59,976 --> 00:48:01,378
REACH OUT TO OTHER

1130
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:02,179
CONSTITUENCIES AND THAT HE IS

1131
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:03,046
NOT A RACIST.

1132
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,082
THAT IS PART OF THE GOAL AS

1133
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:06,583
WELL, THAT HE CAN GO INTO A

1134
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:09,920
HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT, A COMMUNITY

1135
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,655
HE IS NOT USED TO BEING IN AND

1136
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:13,223
COME OUT STRONG AND GIVE HIS

1137
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,191
MESSAGE.

1138
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:17,361
AS PART OF HIS GOAL HERE.

1139
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:18,295
ON SATURDAY, WE WILL SEE HOW HE

1140
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:18,728
DOES.

1141
00:48:18,728 --> 00:48:21,031
MATT: THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING

1142
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:23,166
US.

1143
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:27,604
>> COMING UP, THIS YEAR MAY NOT

1144
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:29,139
BE AS HOT AS LAST YEAR IN TERMS

1145
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:30,474
OF MEGADEALS.

1146
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:31,341
BUT THERE ARE IMPORTANT ONES TO

1147
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:33,210
WATCH.

1148
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:37,214
SUZY QUAN HAS PROTECTIONS OF

1149
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:40,317
WHERE HEALTH CARE IS HEADING

1150
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:40,717
NEXT.

1151
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:41,318
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

1152
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:43,186
♪

1153
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,390
>> "WHAT'D YOU MISS?"

1154
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,459
IT HAS BEEN A QUIET MONDAY FOR

1155
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:03,260
DEALS AS WE WRAP UP THE LAST

1156
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:11,434
WEEK OF SUMMER.

1157
00:51:11,434 --> 00:51:16,106
JEFF ASKED SUZIE WONG HOW M&A

1158
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:16,773
IS LOOKING THIS YEAR.

1159
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:19,442
>> WE HAD BEEN RUNNING EVEN WITH

1160
00:51:19,442 --> 00:51:22,579
2014.

1161
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,446
YEAR TO DATE, 2016 IS A LITTLE

1162
00:51:23,446 --> 00:51:25,816
BEHIND.

1163
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:26,583
IT IS ABOUT EVEN WITH THE

1164
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,351
10-YEAR AVERAGE.

1165
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:30,620
TOO EARLY TO DRAW A CONCLUSION

1166
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:31,454
ABOUT THE YEAR BECAUSE A COUPLE

1167
00:51:31,454 --> 00:51:32,522
OF BIG DEALS CAN CHANGE THOSE

1168
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:34,891
NUMBERS.

1169
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:35,759
WHAT I WOULD SAY IS INTERESTING

1170
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,127
IS THE LAST THREE OR FOUR WEEKS,

1171
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:40,597
WE HAVE HAD AN INFLOW OF NEW

1172
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:41,264
MANDATES THAT COULD BE

1173
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:41,932
INTERESTING.

1174
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:42,732
>> I KNOW YOU SPENT A LOT OF

1175
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:43,733
TIME IN HEALTH CARE.

1176
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:46,870
HOW DOES HEALTH CARE LOOK?

1177
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:47,804
YOU HAVE BEEN ON A BUNCH OF

1178
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:48,772
DEALS.

1179
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,407
HOW IS HEALTH CARE LOOKING?

1180
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:54,144
>> HEALTH CARE IS ALWAYS BUSY.

1181
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:54,878
THAT IS WHY IT IS SUCH AN

1182
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:58,148
INTERESTING MARKET.

1183
00:51:58,148 --> 00:52:00,183
THERE ARE ALWAYS DEALS GOING ON.

1184
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:01,017
WHAT IS INTERESTING IS IF YOU

1185
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:03,520
LOOK AT THE PATTERN, WE HAD

1186
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,423
SEVERAL CYCLES OF CONSOLIDATION

1187
00:52:06,423 --> 00:52:07,958
WITH LARGE COMPANIES MERGING.

1188
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,760
WHAT I FIND REALLY INTERESTING

1189
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,162
IS WHAT YOU ARE SEEING NOW IS

1190
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:13,263
DEALS THAT FOCUS ON SCIENCE.

1191
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:14,064
I THINK THE REASON THAT IS

1192
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:16,800
HAPPENING IS COMPANIES ARE

1193
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,867
LOOKING FOR GROWTH SO THEY NEED

1194
00:52:17,867 --> 00:52:19,035
NEW SCIENCE.

1195
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:24,507
THEY INVEST IN R&D BUT YOU KNOW

1196
00:52:24,507 --> 00:52:25,308
WHAT IT TAKES TO BRING A PRODUCT

1197
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:25,775
TO FRUITION.

1198
00:52:25,775 --> 00:52:28,612
A LOT OF MONEY AND TIME.

1199
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:29,446
THE SECOND REASON IS BIOTECH IS

1200
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:31,248
BECOMING A MORE MATURE INDUSTRY.

1201
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:33,450
YOU HAVE MANY MORE COMPANIES NOW

1202
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:34,251
THAN 10 OR 15 YEARS AGO THAT

1203
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:39,556
HAVE DERISKED.

1204
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:41,424
SOME COMPANIES HAVE BECOME VERY

1205
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:44,361
BIG.

1206
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:46,363
ACQUIRERS CAN LOOK AT THESE

1207
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:47,163
COMPANIES AND SAY I CAN SEE THAT

1208
00:52:47,163 --> 00:52:49,099
BECOMING BIG AND HAVING A BIG

1209
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:49,599
IMPACT ON ME.

1210
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:55,071
>> 10 YEARS AGO, EVERYBODY WAS

1211
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:55,772
TRYING TO BUY DRUGS IN THE

1212
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:56,272
HEPATITIS SPACE.

1213
00:52:56,272 --> 00:52:57,273
NOW IT SEEMS WE ARE IN THE ERA

1214
00:52:57,273 --> 00:52:58,508
OF CANCER DRUGS.

1215
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:02,345
WHAT IS THE NEXT AREA THEY ARE

1216
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:02,946
GOING TO GO AFTER?

1217
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:04,514
>> YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT IN

1218
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:07,317
TERMS OF, THEY LOOK FOR BIG

1219
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:09,686
MARKET PROFITS.

1220
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,821
THEY FIRST WENT AFTER

1221
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:12,655
CARDIOVASCULAR AND CHOLESTEROL.

1222
00:53:12,655 --> 00:53:16,893
THEN IT WAS HEP C.

1223
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:17,694
AND NOW I'M COLLEGE HE.

1224
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:21,531
BEFORE I GET TO WHAT IS NEXT, IT

1225
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:23,400
IS KEY TO REMEMBER ONCOLOGY IS A

1226
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,768
BIG MARKET.

1227
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:27,303
I THINK WE ARE AT THE TIP OF THE

1228
00:53:27,303 --> 00:53:34,510
ICEBERG ON ONCOLOGY.

1229
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:35,311
I THINK THAT WILL GO ON FOR A

1230
00:53:35,311 --> 00:53:36,079
WHILE.

1231
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:36,913
I TALKED EARLIER ABOUT THERE

1232
00:53:36,913 --> 00:53:39,048
BEING A LOT MORE MATURE BIOTECH

1233
00:53:39,048 --> 00:53:41,218
COMPANIES.

1234
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,018
ONE IMPORTANT POINT IS IN THE

1235
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:44,954
SEARCH FOR GROWTH, IF YOU LOOK

1236
00:53:44,954 --> 00:53:45,922
AT THE BIOTECH MARKET FIVE YEARS

1237
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:49,392
AGO AND ACQUISITIONS, PHARMA

1238
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:52,962
COMPANIES USUALLY LOOKS FOR

1239
00:53:52,962 --> 00:53:53,797
COMPANIES CLOSE TO LAUNCHING A

1240
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:55,232
DRUG.

1241
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,200
IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS, A LOT OF

1242
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,436
DEALS GOT DONE BEFORE

1243
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:00,270
COMMERCIALIZATION MEANING THEY

1244
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,372
WERE WILLING TO TAKE SOME RISK.

1245
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:03,206
I THINK ONCOLOGY IS GOING TO GO

1246
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:04,074
ON FOR A WHILE.

1247
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:07,277
THE OTHER AREA IS ORPHAN OR RARE

1248
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:09,412
DISEASES.

1249
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:12,249
YOU HAVE SMALL POPULATIONS.

1250
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:13,850
WHEN YOU BUY A DRUG OR COMPANY

1251
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:14,784
IN THAT SPACE, YOU HAVE LESS

1252
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:18,054
PETITION IN TERMS OF R&D BUT YOU

1253
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:19,522
ALSO HAVE MORE PRICING

1254
00:54:19,522 --> 00:54:20,323
FLEXIBILITY AND CAN SHOW REAL

1255
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:24,361
CLERICAL IMPACT.

1256
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:27,063
IF YOU LOOK SEVERAL YEARS OUT, I

1257
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:28,331
THINK DEMOGRAPHICS WOULD POINT

1258
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:30,367
ME TOWARDS THINGS LIKE

1259
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:33,503
ALZHEIMER'S, PARKINSON'S,

1260
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:34,204
DEGENERATIVE DISEASES.

1261
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:36,573
>> YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON

1262
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:37,641
CROSS-BORDER DEALS.

1263
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:40,310
COMPANIES IN THE U.S. BUYING IN

1264
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,612
ASIA OR EUROPE.

1265
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:45,815
BREXIT, HAS THAT BEEN THE IMPACT

1266
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:46,483
WE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT?

1267
00:54:46,483 --> 00:54:49,285
HASN'T SLOWED DOWN -- HAS IT

1268
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:50,153
SLOWED DOWN M&A?

1269
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:53,923
>> BREXIT HAS HAD SOME IMPACT ON

1270
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:57,360
THINKING.

1271
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,294
I DON'T THINK IT WILL IMPACT A

1272
00:54:58,294 --> 00:54:59,129
COMPANY THAT HAS A STRATEGIC

1273
00:54:59,129 --> 00:54:59,896
IMPERATIVE TO INVEST IN A

1274
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:01,831
CERTAIN MARKET OR PRODUCT OR WHO

1275
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:02,799
REALLY NEEDS GROWTH.

1276
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:06,569
I THINK TEMPORARILY PEOPLE ARE

1277
00:55:06,569 --> 00:55:08,905
TRYING TO ORIENT THEMSELVES

1278
00:55:08,905 --> 00:55:09,639
TOWARD WHAT WE THINK HAPPENS

1279
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,207
NEXT.

1280
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:11,975
I THINK IT IS VERY COMPANY

1281
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,009
SPECIFIC.

1282
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:13,977
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

1283
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:17,013
INDIVIDUAL COMPANY.

1284
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:19,082
MULTINATIONALS OFTEN HAVE

1285
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:19,949
OPERATIONS IN DIFFERENT PLACES.

1286
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:21,918
WHERE IS HEADQUARTERED DOES NOT

1287
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:27,090
DETERMINE THE EXIT OF BREXIT --

1288
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:27,891
WHERE IT IS HEADQUARTERED DOES

1289
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:28,625
NOT DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF

1290
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:28,992
BREXIT.

1291
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:34,030
>> THAT WAS EARLIER TODAY.

1292
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:38,768
MATT: TIME FOR A LOOK AT SOME OF

1293
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:39,569
THE BIGGEST BUSINESS STORIES IN

1294
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:40,136
THE NEWS RIGHT NOW.

1295
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:43,806
AMERICAN AIRLINES'S HAS OUSTED

1296
00:55:43,806 --> 00:55:48,411
THE PRESIDENT.

1297
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:49,379
AMERICAN SAYS KIRBY IS LEAVING

1298
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:51,314
IMMEDIATELY.

1299
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:52,782
HE WILL REPORT TO UNITED C.E.O.

1300
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:57,120
OSCAR MUNOZ.

1301
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:00,356
SOUTHWEST AND THE PILOTS UNION

1302
00:56:00,356 --> 00:56:01,090
HAVE AGREED ON THE BASICS OF A

1303
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:01,524
CONTRACT.

1304
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:05,128
IT WOULD PROVIDE A 15% PAY RAISE

1305
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:06,996
FOLLOWED BY FOUR ANNUAL

1306
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:07,630
