when you say that the court has gotten too politicized what decisions do you think are examples of that well I think Roe versus Wade I support a woman's right to choose I always have I strongly support a woman's right to choose Roe vs. Wade was a disaster because it weakened politically us the pro-choice movement turned it over to nine men to decide the fate of women it's strengthened the right it probably resulted in the election of the first George Bush as president because it gave the Republicans a pass on the abortion issue saying it's up to the Supreme Court we don't really have any impact so I think that was entering into the political thinking I don't think a single mine has been changed as the result of Roe vs. Wade people who still believe that the fetus is the soul and a human being oppose abortion people who have different views favor abortion that was the wrong place for the Supreme Court to go gay marriage the right place to go a reapportionment the right place to go wait so why is why was gay marriage the right place for the court to go but but not abortion because gay marriage is a trend and the Supreme Court just got a little ahead of the trend ten years from now nobody will understand opposition to gay marriage it's something that was inevitable it was going to happen the Supreme Court just led the way if it hadn't led the way by the way we'd have gay marriage and you know 40 of the 50 jurisdictions but and by the way we'd also have the right of a woman to choose in 40 it's the ten other jurisdictions that we were even but what about what about the policy matters themselves I mean is it was Roe versus Wade wrong as a matter of constitutional law and but but then obergefell was correct as a matter of cause that's right because here in in in in Roe vs. Wade you really have a conflict if you believe that there's a soul in a human being you don't kill that human being out of choice a marriage what's the countervailing argument who cares how does it affect anybody's but how does it legitimately affect anybody's legitimate interest the answer to gay marriage is mind your own business take care of your own marriage make sure that's better the idea that you will be impacted by the fact that John and Sam love each other and want to live together it's just of your business and it's something that libertarians can agree to it's something that liberals can agree to it's something that legitimate conservatives can agree to so I've never seen that as an issue that should divide America and it won't in ten years abortion will continue to divide America as long as this country exists
