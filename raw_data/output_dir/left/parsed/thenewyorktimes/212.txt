It was supposed to be
the mass shooting that
finally galvanized
the country
and forced lawmakers
into action:
17 people dead after a
massacre inside a high school.
Emotional calls for gun reform.
"I want to feel safe at school."
Then, in came the N.R.A.,
with a slick campaign
and access to the
Oval Office,
to grind momentum
almost to a halt.
So how did the N.R.A.
pull this off?
The president needs
N.R.A. endorsement
to rally his support base,
especially in an election year.
Because of that,
the N.R.A managed
to secure meetings
with Trump in the
immediate aftermath of
the Parkland school shooting,
when calls for reform
were the loudest.
The N.R.A. has catchy,
succinct slogans
that are easy to remember
and drive their point across.
"To stop a bad guy with a gun,
it takes a good guy with a gun."
After Parkland, the N.R.A.
spokesperson went head to head
with student victims on TV.
"Well, I think the A.T.F. is
deciding about bump stocks
right now. The president ordered
the D.O.J. to look into it."
"I’m asking your opinion as a
representative of the N.R.A."
"That's what the N.R.A.'s position
has been. The N.R.A. came —
"What's yours?"
"I'm talking for them.
These are the 5 million members
that I’m here representing."
And on the group’s own channel 
they broadcasted stuff like this:
"These kids ought to
be marching against
their own hypocritical
belief structures.
They hate machines that
cause death except, hold on,
no, you ain't never going
to take their cars away.
They hate the idea
that guns save lives,
except the only reason
we’ve ever heard of them
is because guns didn't
come soon enough."
The N.R.A. aggressively
mobilized a membership drive
a few weeks after Parkland.
"Now is the time for all of us
to join together in defense
of the principles that
make America the
greatest nation on earth."
They claim to have over
5 million members.
But that figure has not been
confirmed by any outside party.
After Parkland, Florida
lawmakers passed
the first significant
gun control bill
in more than 20 years:
raising the age limit to buy
rifles from 18 to 21.
The N.R.A. promptly filed suit.
The calls for gun reform after
the Parkland shooting haven’t
stopped, and neither have the
N.R.A.'s efforts to thwart them.
