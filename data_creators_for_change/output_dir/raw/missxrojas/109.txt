00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,129
hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone so as of today I've been</font>

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:05,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">making videos on YouTube for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years</font>

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,139
that is nuts completely and utterly

4
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:12,240
bananas on every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible level</font>

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,219
so I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about how to</font>

6
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,049
commemorate this big moment which is a

7
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,910
huge moment for me personally but also a

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,010
fun excuse to do and like an interesting

9
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,350
the massive creative<font color="#CCCCCC"> broad scale video</font>

10
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,480
and I then eventually felt so

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,369
overwhelmed with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pressure of trying</font>

12
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:28,830
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a cool video for my 10th</font>

13
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,410
anniversary video that I went back to my

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,239
roots I went back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the origins of</font>

15
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,059
YouTube I went back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the early days of</font>

16
00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:36,989
birthday collapse and this was a

17
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:38,340
phenomenon in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first few years of</font>

18
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,899
YouTube in particular where when<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

19
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:41,520
friend and YouTube had a birthday you'd

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,469
email round and message round all their

21
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:44,850
friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> and other youtubers that you</font>

22
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,440
knew and you'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked them all to send in</font>

26

27
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,059
massaging my own ego partly about it but

28
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:55,860
