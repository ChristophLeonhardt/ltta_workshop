this was the moment the GCC crisis was born coordinated and multi-platform attack on Qatar state media outlets Saudi Arabia Bahrain Egypt and the UAE say they're severing diplomatic relations with Qatar we have taken this step with great pain no one has give them the right to look at my country no one is giving them the right to separate families and displaced people Nations came together and spoke to me about confronting Qatar they are trying to intimidate a small country which has the closest relation with the United States this is the long awaited list the list of demands include cutting ties with the Muslim Brotherhood the closure of the Al Jazeera media network the pedometer doin Alethia Ferelden hasar angelica pelvic to the Hakusho Natalija the donor our sovereignty is a red line we don't accept anybody interfering our sovereignty it's just past 9 p.m. here in Doha the Sun is down people are out enjoying Ramadan celebrations having broken their fast a little over two hours ago but it was one year ago celebrations had been unexpectedly interrupted in a way no one could quite believe Qatar was suddenly under blockade by land sea and air and its relationship with its Gulf neighbors had changed perhaps permanently hello everyone I'm Kemal Santamaria welcome to this special broadcast here on al-jazeera for the next hour as we mark exactly one year since the start of the Gulf crisis now it's not the kind of anniversary which is exactly welcomed or celebrated here but cut as residents have been marking the day it's generally a quieter time of year given it's the holy month of Ramadan but even so this precession happened a few hours ago led by members of the local bikers community with flags and pictures of support on display now just a reminder before we get going that this broadcast is going to be streamed live on twitter at aj english also at facebook.com slash al jazeera so if you want to get involved and send us your comments and your questions then please do so on those platforms right so let's begin how did we get to this point it needs some explaining it needs some context and with that here is Alexia brand I'm going to take you through a timeline of events now but we have to go back to before the severing of diplomatic ties because they were already signed something that was up May 20th the US president Donald Trump lands in Saudi Arabia to meet King Salman and other Arab leaders Trump later took credit for Saudis move against Qatar in a series of tweets linking it to the summit just three days later may 23rd and the Qatar news agency is hacked it attributes false statements to the Emir of Qatar their broadcast on Saudi and Emirati media despite the Qatar e-government saying it's fake news then on June 4th leaked emails from the UAE ambassador to the US reveal what appears to be a long-running effort to discredit Qatar and that brings us to June 5th when diplomatic ties are cut and an economic embargo is imposed now to understand the impact of the Gulf crisis it helps if you can see how the region's laid out the full blockading nations are Egypt Saudi Arabia Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates they accused Qatar on this peninsula here of spreading instability and supporting terrorism claims Doha strongly denies on June 5th Saudi Arabia closes cutters only land border causing a run on the supermarkets and forcing alternative suppliers to be found access to the sea is restricted as well to bypass the blockade cutters had to ship directly through ports in Oman ear routes were also closed pushing Qatar Airways to make major Deiters kateri families with relatives and other countries and vice versa are torn apart at this point Qatar calls for dialogue and that's taken up by the Emir of Kuwait weeks later the four countries released a list of demands they include wanting Qatar to scale back its diplomatic ties with Iran and close a Turkish military base here they pressured doha to cut all ties with what they call terrorist organizations including the Muslim Brotherhood and they called for the shutting down of the Al Jazeera news channel as well as other media outlets funded by the Calgary government right so that's how we got to this point but a year on the diplomatic stalemate continues Qatar and its people are still under a blockade but what has changed is that the countries made a giant leap towards self-sufficiency and through some friendly overtures cemented its relations with its allies Hashim attleboro explains now it has not been an easy year for Qatar but for now products from all over the world fill up store shelves cranes are the most visible sign of the huge push to build mega projects in time for football's World Cup in 2022 but a year ago on the 5th of June during the fasting month of Ramadan Qataris woke up to an unprecedented crisis Saudi Arabia the UAE Bahrain and Egypt cut off diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a land sea and air embargo the block 18 countries accused the Qatari government of sponsoring terrorism accusations Doha strongly denied attempts by the Emir of Kuwait and regional leaders to end the diplomatic feud have made no progress so far unfortunately we don't see any credible indicators to suggest that there will be a solution in the near future I think there have been serious attempts in the past serious efforts invested to broker this crisis and to reach an agreement but unfortunately the parties are still stuck in their positions and unable to move forward with a solution the four Arab countries were hoping to see the blockade isolate utta internationally but what followed was a Qatari diplomatic offensive led by the Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani who met world leaders his country signed major arms deals with France Italy the UK and an agreement with the u.s. to combat terrorism financing in April the Emir met President Donald Trump in Washington DC the u.s. leader hailed Qatar as a force of stability in the region and Trump who also met Saudi Arabia's calm Prince Mohammed bin Salman around the same time expressed concerns about the fallout from the crisis it's a very unstable region and the Gulf has always been the most stable part of an unstable region and this crisis has kind of thrown this region into a quagmire that it didn't have to be in and I think the trauma ministration realizes that you know at least we have to provide one pole of stability and the center of gravity of the art world in general has been the Gulf in recent years so why they a region there a crisis there is something that that had to be avoided at all cost Trump has invited the GCC leaders to meet in the u.s. in the hope of finding a political solution but that invitation has been delayed the blockading countries insist no talks will take place until Qatar meets their demands Hashima para al Jazeera and that's not gonna happen we've heard that directly from cut as foreign minister mohammed bin abdul rahman al thani he told Sammy's head and that Qatar will not back down from plans to buy a Russian anti-missile system despite reports that Saudi Arabia was threatening military action if it did so French media has been reporting that Saudi Arabia is threatening that military action first of all just let me let us make it very clear that the purchase of any military equipment is a sovereign decision which no country has anything to do with so there is no illegitimate a grievance behind this letter and threatening Qatar it's violating the international laws by writing all the international norms and the most importantly it's violating the GCC Charter which is the countries of the GCC should not launch an attack against each other so we believe that this letter has no any legal basis to justify any action we have been subjected to unilateral measure which was taken by by the Saudis unfortunately as a reckless behavior there's gotta need to take any defensive military steps in light of this reported well we are going to take the all various reaction to defend our country but what do you count with this is first of all this is not there is no any serious military threat out of this but it's the way it's being used to justify or to create any disturbance in the region is just unacceptable so Qatar is going to treat this the same way they have we have treated the illegal blockade we are going to seek all the international fora to make sure that this behavior is right so let's get and about here in Doha we are starting at katara the cultural village here in Doha with a reporter Stephanie Decker hi Stephanie how would you describe the mood of people not just there but the mood of people in the country these days one year after the blockade began well people are just starting to trickle in here it is of course past if Todd we're seeing a couple of people arriving not as full as it will be in a couple of hours but the people we have spoken to many of them actually not aware that this is the one-year anniversary but of course everyone aware of this blockade the mood in the country you know as we both know is one of defiance one of the girls said you know we will remain strong what you know the impact of it the consequence of it is that this country really rallied behind its leadership behind the emir behind the government Qatar days and expats alike this is a country of a majority population who are expats you know you have sketches of famous now sketch of the profile of the Emir on buildings on cars whether its cuddly or of the expat so there is a real feeling of unity but there's also a feeling of anger of course because these countries have made it so personal it's not a political crisis in the sense that diplomatic ties have been cut the withdrawal of ambassadors know what these countries have done have stopped Qatari citizens from traveling to Saudi Arabia for example to the Emirates this is a culture the GCC you know there's intermarriage there's family so this is deeply personal it's affecting families seeing each other it's affecting students who are studying so that is something that people here feel deeply upset about but that the general mood is one that cotton has come out on top of here that it has taken the moral high ground and everyone's still remaining very very strongly behind their leadership and certainly don't want this government to concede anything do you think people have gotten used to it all Stephanie because you could call it a crisis one year of a crisis or you could call it an actual shift a complete change in the way that cutter relates with its neighbors over a good many number of years to come absolutely and I think in a sense this is you know we're seeing life continue as normal many people not aware that it is a one-year anniversary I think it's also many people will tell you thanks to the government and what they have done to try and you know bridge the gap of what was blockaded in the sense of particularly when it first started come all the air land and sea blockade people extremely nervous not knowing how this is going to play out people ran on the supermarket's and within a day or two the government had found alternative sources from Iran from Turkey the supermarket shelves were stock prices have gone up somewhat but not hugely so I think people also very grateful at how it's been managed but of course yes I think a lot of people use speak to as well will tell you that they don't see this any ending anytime soon they're aware of how complicated the political relations are and zero mentioning earlier some of those reports you know it's almost like saving face they don't see how in the short term at least this is going to end because the blockading countries haven't achieved the long list of demands that they wanted and again they agreed that absolutely under no circumstances should cut that can see to that so I think people have become used to it they're of course not happy about it but as they say they remain strong they remain very supportive of their government and their leader and they will continue to just you know end or the blockade as it goes on that is Stephanie Decker at the Qatari cultural village here in Doha Thank You Stephanie well after the blockade began it was revealed the blockading countries didn't just want to isolate Qatar diplomatically there were reports of a possible invasion of Qatar even suggestions of regime change Mohammed Valle explains that this portrait of the Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-thani has become one of the most potent symbols of nationalism here in Qatar it was born from the crisis that shook this nation a year ago to the day and that's for a reason it took the blockading countries several weeks to make any demands of Qatar and the list of demands that finally emerged didn't include what was later known to be the most shocking part of those countries plan to overthrow cutters government their primary option was a military invasion that's according to the Emir of Kuwait who made the revelation in September during a visit to the White House he said his peacemaking efforts had helped avoid a war between Qatar and its Gulf neighbors during the early stages of the crisis Qatar accepted what may have been a timely Turkish offer of military assistance with the war option put aside Saudi Arabia UAE Bahrain and Egypt began to try other methods to destabilize Qataris government they tried every possible means in order to disturb destabilize the government or at least change the foreign policy of this of this country but I think it has backfired and they got exactly the exact opposite results here I think the Qatar is they managed to circumvent all these items by signing an agreement on combating the finance of terrorism with the United States Saudi and UAE sponsored media outlets openly called for a coup in Doha and began to incite Qataris to rise against the Meo they also began a series of attempts to promote an alternative leadership from within Qataris ruling Al Thani family Saudi media broadcast photos of what they said was a meeting between King Salman and Cheryl Abdullah Al Thani a senior member of the ruling family but with no role in government it gave rise to speculation and rumors about his alleged aspirations for power but months later share Abdullah appeared in a video to announce that he was being held against his will inside the palace in the United Arab Emirates at the request of Mohammed the zayed the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi in a similarly desperate move Saudi funded Al Hayat newspaper featured on its first page a non-existent and Fanny dissident whom it gave the name sound banal using financial incentives and promises of influence the Saudis also tried to buy the allegiance of certain tribes that straddle the border with Qatar but Qatar is say that process to undermine their leadership had the opposite effect can't oh but Amina they expected us to support the blockade on our country to give up soon and to stand against our own government but none of that happened of course as you see we stand behind our Emir and we are more United than before but that attack see you maxi Allen their plot has backfired because it doesn't make sense for us to undermine our own country we support our Emir in every step that he takes the Emir's portrait painted by a local artist turned into a powerful symbol of national unity plastering the facades of high-rise buildings becoming almost omnipresent across the country are the symbols against a blockade have also been created Qatar considers the fifth of June day in which there was a foreign plot against its sovereignty its leadership and its economic development that date is now set in stone here and commemorated through this feat of modern engineering the message is not only has cut our water the plot that was meant to bring about its demise but it also becomes stronger because of it Mohammed Val reporting there from what's now known as the 5/6 interchange here in Doha the 5th of June isn't it right modulo Ansari is with us here professor of political sociology at Qatar University I've lost track of the number of times you and I've sat on a studio and talked about this but it's been a few over the past year hasn't it they certainly do you feel we've progressed any further as far as a resolution I mean I yes it's good that you put that in there because I was gonna say has gotta progressed certainly has gotten better progressed in this year rapidly on many fronts but when it comes to the crisis it is very clear that the three locating countries plus Egypt find themselves in a situation where I continued crisis is better a solution that could result in losing you know as we say in arabic the face is water if you will say the face is water which is basically meaning being embarrassed okay yeah and it's and this term has been used a lot during the crisis to describe how this crescent come to a solution which is basically said the same as saying saving saving face but what are they getting out of it what are those four countries getting out of it at the moment they were hoping to get a lot of it from the in the beginning of the crisis now we all know that that did not happen now it is what they could lose if the crisis ends they have an emotional attachment to the crisis now they have a very politically oriented media outreach about the crisis that they cannot take back any solution to the crisis at the moment will seem like a defeat which is something that they do not want to do so as with the other crisis they are involved in like Yemen Libya and and other places the only reason the only way forward is to is to basically go forward and hope that there is a change in the climate in the future that could allow them to claim a second victim let's rewind a year seeing as we are reflecting on on the incident itself if you like when this all happened a year ago do you think this all could have actually turned out very differently if Qatar hadn't stood up and showed some resilience and if the population hadn't stayed United the way it did but this could have all turned out very very differently certainly I mean if you look back at the 2013 crisis which which actually resulted in an agreement between all the countries after that Qatar has tried to cater to the blockading countries and in many ways supporting their efforts in Yemen to some extent lessening the media criticism of their positions on various issues all of that of course did not even help in mitigating the situation that helped in making the blockade in countries look favorably to Qatar now it is very clear that the only solution with these countries is to basically a certain dependence assert sovereignty and move forward away from this country there is no solution where we can see a Qatar going back again to concessions to these countries but the relationship has changed irrevocably hasn't this thing even if the quote-unquote crisis ended tomorrow you can't go back on a lot of the things that have been said and done can you exactly and and this is not an issue only concerning like media and official statements even when it comes to trust in the and in the business side of it I mean in the markets now who would trust investing from Qatar in one of the locating countries who would trust importing products from these countries it doesn't make any sense because at any moment a political decision could actually hamper all this business void like what happened in in Dubai during this crisis and and with the products coming in from Saudi Arabia therefore there's no taking back what happened the way forward says independence and sovereignty follow Qatar and it says a balanced relationship with all our neighbors in the region while at the same time making sure that we have sustainable diplomacy which is a balance with all the powers in the world good relationship with Russia good relationship with the United States working relationship with Europe and and Southeast Asia and Africa and and and normal relations with other other neighbors like Iran and so forth because it is very difficult for us now to think of the future of capital without thinking of this balance that could maintain that are in front of any future crisis modular answer it's a pleasure always talking to you thank you for coming in thank you so let's talk more about these efforts to end the crisis Kuwait has been a key mediator it's Emir Sheikh Sabah al-ahmad al-jaber al-sabah it's been urging Gulf unity but so far you'd have to say his efforts haven't really paid off live to Kuwait City now and our correspondent jamal al shale welcome ah yes the those references you say some people will say haven't achieved their ultimate aim which is bringing about an end to this crisis a crisis that has not only deeply affected the countries directly involved namely a Qatar and the three nations blockading its butts also threatened the very fabric the very future of the GCC the Gulf Cooperation Council which for decades many have seen as the main source of stability in an extremely unstable region but what's been significant over the past few months is that although the Kuwaitis have managed to achieve certain milestones like preventing this crisis from transforming into a military one transforming from a diplomatic one to a military one there is a growing sense amongst certain sections of Kuwaiti society actually that they could be targeted by the same hawkish politicians and political figures in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia those who have been going out after Qatar and spearing Qatar as they believe in terms of the PR campaigns there are some here in Kuwait who have similar fears having said that the government is adamant that it will continue to try and find a solution to this crisis and we spoke to some of the members of society here as well as politicians to find out a bit more at almost 90 years old Sheikh Sabah al-ahmad al-sabah of Kuwait is the oldest leader in the GCC he's nicknamed the wise man of the Gulf it was no surprise then that when half of the Gulf Council members decided to impose a land air and sea blockade on Qatar throwing the region into chaos and threatening the GCC is very existence that it was him in his government who stepped in to try and solve the crisis from the beginning Kuwait has asked Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to sit down and discuss their concerns with Qatar and whilst Doha has repeatedly expressed its willingness for unconditional dialogue the three blockading nations have rejected Kuwait score that doesn't mean however that Kuwait's efforts have not come to fruition a few months after the blockade on Qatar was announced chef subra revealed during his visit to Washington that he had managed to prevent the crisis from escalating into a military one suddenly this dispute came into existence thank God now what is important is that we have stopped any military action adamant not to allow the crisis to deepen even more Kuwait went ahead with hosting the annual GCC summit in December optimists were hoping that it would provide a breakthrough while the pessimists thought the summit itself would never convene ultimately it did and the fact that Kuwait managed to pull it off albeit with Saudi the UA I am Bahrain sending junior representation was considered a success abdullah haji is a professor of political science at Kuwait University and while the current crisis has provided him with great teaching material for his classes he believes the GCC is facing its most dangerous phase in its history we have instability we have threat from state actors from non-state actors you have terrorism and you do not have really the luxury of dealing with all these threats on individual bases or with a fragmented GCC so we hope that cooler heads and rational heads would prevail despite the attempt to mediate an insistence from the country's leadership to maintain neutrality many in Kuwait believe that the UAE and Saudi Arabia could turn on them true that the blockading nations have not demonstrated any willingness to solve this crisis after Kuwait managed to foil their military plans these countries were betting on time hoping the siege would succeed but that too has failed those currently in office including this lawmaker who was head of the Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee when the crisis began last year tells me that a solution can and will be found you can let me up there are efforts that continue behind the scenes I'm confident and optimistic that we shall see a solution in the near future my hope is that we all focus on the positives and not dwell on the negatives this is the biggest crisis facing the Gulf Cooperation Council since 1990 back then Kuwait was being invaded and its independence under threat many believe it is the memory of those dark days that continues to push the leadership here to try and find a solution to this crisis and whilst that solution remains elusive 12 months since the blockade on Qatar began the fact of the matter is were not for Kuwaiti mediation efforts this crisis could have been a lot worse jamal al al al Jazeera Kuwait of course the u.s. is another key player in this dispute but for many America's position has been confusing Donald Trump initially supported the blockading Nations but has since offered to mediate himself from washington d.c Roslin Jordan with more a year ago President Donald Trump took sides in the dispute between Qatar and its neighbors the nation of Qatar unfortunately has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level so we had a decision to make do we take the easy road or do we finally take a hard but necessary action we have to stop the funding of terrorism this was Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Saudi Arabia a few weeks ago both unity is necessary we need to achieve it the Trump administration's policy shift on the Qatar blockade may look clear-cut but it's not after Trump endorsed the blockade the Secretary of State at the time Rex Tillerson and defense secretary Jim mattis had to convince the president to soften his position why long-running diplomatic and military ties including 10,000 u.s. troops at a loaded airbase the US was also on the verge of making a 12 billion dollar deal with Qatar for a new fleet of f-15 fighter jets what's more Washington had asked Doha to host Taliban and Hamas offices in order to facilitate long-term peace talks with their enemies finally Tillerson and mattis thought the blockade could harm the US as war against ISIL as well as let Iran expand its influence in the region experts say they succeeded by convincing the president he had fallen into a trap set by the Saudis and Emiratis it was recognized that would president Trump coming into office surrounding himself by non experts and people who had been you know not have been in government during the diplomatic service that this would be an opportunity to score a long-term grievance Washington's goal from then on support who waits efforts to broker an end to the crisis mr. president we have a problem with our neighbors and in both phone calls and meetings Adam and that all parties in the cutter dispute solved their differences the United States withdrew from the Iran agreement and there's an understanding that in order to roll back Iran's regional quest for hegemony the Arab states our friends and partners in the region need to cooperate the Saudis and Emiratis haven't stopped trying to undermine Doha status in Washington but US officials are pushing for the blockade to end before the u.s. GCC summit now scheduled for September because in their view the rift is more trouble than it's worth rosalind jordan al jazeera washington let's look at cutters finances now because when this crisis began a year ago the monetary impact was immediate and harsh anecdotally first of all they were massive queues at foreign exchanges and there was a shortage of US dollars at that point as well but it's the numbers that tell the real story about twenty three billion dollars left the country in the first two months as worried investors and expats moved their money to safety it led the Cutlery government to inject thirty eight and a half billion dollars into the economy a lot of it going into the financial sector and into imports to make sure that food and supplies could get into the country mostly by air speaking of air though the aviation sector and everything related to it took a hit to the number of flights into Qatar decrease the big carriers like Emirates and Saudi a stock flying into Doha it led to a drop in visitor arrivals we're now talking November at this point and it's figures like that which led to cutters non hydrocarbon growth that is the economy outside of oil and natural gas falling to 4% in 2017 it was 5.6 percent the previous year what's surprising though after hearing all that is that cutters economy is now recovering and proving resilient these numbers come from the IMF which is expecting growth of 2.6 percent this year 3 percent in 2019 which isn't bad for a country where the only land border has been closed for an entire year cutters had to spend a lot to keep its head above water since June of 2017 but so far it seems to be working well joining us here in the studio now we have Khalid Al Carter a specialist in monetary policy and political economy at Qatar central bank a pleasure having you with us here do you know I just seen from the Fitch Ratings agency that they are revising cutters outlook to stable from negative I mean that's a good start as that show that Qatar has weathered this past year and is actually improving well that's expected to begin with the reason for that was political tension in the beginning to begin with the beginning of the crisis along with lower oil prices and squeezed budgets Saudis factor our nola are improving so this is expected to be good to begin with let me first start with a comment on what your report just right now you know regarding capital flight this is we're not talking here about capital of light in the normal sense mostly this was a deliberate deposit would draw all by the blockading country in order in a context of a general more general economic warfare against Qatar to destabilize the currency and trigger further capital flow with the potential consequences of high inflation and draining foreign reserve and destabilize the economy what the final objective of economic collapse and regime collapse so I'm not totally surprised though that the economy is resilient as you mentioned in your report and after a year it's in good shape actually almost a year ago I wasn't that's your partner Jazeera Arabic I was talking about this and I said this blockade is ineffective and it's destined to failed and we'll be surprised to see otherwise and there are a reason for this it cost a lot of money though initially Qatar had to dip into its reserves and spend quite a bit of money to stabilize everything do you think that had a long-term effect and the fact that the borders are still closed the blockade still in place so money still needs the initial impact has an initial impact to stabilize the economy is not because we lost a lot from our neighbor to begin with if you look at the GCC economy the structure of the GCC economy carefully you examine it you see the recipe for the failure of the blockade is there right there this economy are weak structurally weak this economy are not diversified they all specialized they are all specialized in extracting one natural resources oil and exporting to the rest of the world and importing in exchange most of their need of consumption good capital good labor from overseas therefore there is not much to exchange between them and to trade between them and to a pressure and Qatar through the trade sanction this economies are not this concern not industrialized they are not productive industrial wise or agriculture why they don't export to Qatar machinery or mechanical mechanical equipment or medical equipment or equipment neither a necessity for such as flour grain rice corn you name so to boycott Qatar with what so these are the this is the fundamental this is like a lake down the infrastructure or the environment for the failure of the economy plus the sound economic policy adopted by Qatar whether earlier before ahead of the decay ahead of the block two decades ago and while investing in a productive infrastructure and general infrastructure and the investment infrastructure would provide source of sustainability and stability for the economy or the counter blockading policy after the imposition of the blockade yes there was a limited exposure to the blockade in country in certain products like poultry dairy product vegetable however in a in a group of country that were seeking economic integration over three decades that was natural however this most of this progress that can be easily imported from overseas with the high flexibility and can be produced locally to significant to up to a to a significant extent or deserve what happened the government action alone involved from the beginning and diversify sources and mean of import and open the new trade line and through sea and air and utilize the high capacity infrastructure to bypass the blockade the country and reach out to the original sources and alternative sources of of import and then to ensure sustainability of flow of good with within a regional price for the consumer solid thank you so much carla del cata talkin finances with us in this last year thank you so much we're gonna talk a VA Shin now that as part of the financial story Qatar is a one airline nation that airline is Qatar Airways and it's massively important to the country especially with as we've pointed out the land borders now closed we go to Hamad International Airport in Doha now and our correspondent Natasha who named Kamal cut our Airways has not released its 2017 earnings or passenger data but the CEO acknowledges its bottom line has taken a big hit for starters it lost access to 18 cities some passengers have grumbled about a rise in ticket prices and a more restrictive frequent flyer program the CEO says this is part of a business plan to bring Qatar Airways in line with its competitors one thing is certain the state-owned airline is fighting to mitigate the impact of this blockade Qatar Airways seems to be adhering to an Arab proverb that says right the bad things in sand the good things on a piece of marble the state-owned airline says despite the challenges of the year-old blockade it received numerous industry accolades including best airline of 2017 it did impact us that it increased our flying time it put pressure on my operational cost but it did not stop the will and the determination of us to keep on our path of growth Qatar Airways says it's still auditing its books from last year and can't say exactly how much money the blockade has cost the airline but it says the losses are quote substantial prior to the blockade its profits were soaring in 2016 it earned more than 500 million dollars a historic high and flew 20 percent more passengers than the year before cut our Airways says it's defeating the blockade by implementing a strategy of expansion in the last year the airline has added a new fleet of planes allowing it to fly greater distances to more destinations when it lost access to routes in Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates Egypt and Bahrain it added them elsewhere and it forged international partnerships in the United States and Italy but cut our Airways has seen a drop in passengers the cargo division has managed to fill the void not only has it not posted any losses it has managed to maintain its perch as one of the top three cargo companies in the world former cargo perspective it's a lot easier to redeploy that capacity so what we have lost with the GCC countries we've managed to redeploy it the challenges are still not to be able to serve 18 destinations that we used to serve the CEO of Qatar Airways says the airline can shoulder losses for the foreseeable future and there's no need to ask the government for a bailout but he admits it will be a very different scenario for the company if the blockade becomes a long-term reality for Qatar Natasha a guy named Al Jazeera Doha one of the major challenges of the blockade came when the four countries stopped selling fresh produce to Qatar so immediately stocks needed to be replaced on supermarket shelves but there was also a push to start doing it with local produce how do you do that though when only six percent of your land is actually farmville you get creative Laura Burton Manley went to the ballade no farm in northern Qatar these cows are the unlikely heroes of the year-long blockhead led by Saudi Arabia the Saudis went almost overnight from providing 80% of cutters fresh milk to zero to cushion the blow by Ladner farm flew and shipped in thousands of cows from Europe and America and they bought state-of-the-art technology to run a large dairy farm in the desert there's a total new infrastructure there's a total new dairy industry which wasn't there a year ago and actually in fresh milk we are already self-sufficient one year after we have about 10,000 cows and by the end of the year we'll have let's say around 20 thousand cows so we still in the growing phase in the building phase everything the farm needs is made then from the dry feed to the dairy products and I'm told this factory will soon be run by robots now one of the major challenges is to keep these cows cool in the blistering summer heat and these water sprays and Johnny plans the count instead on to the date the art rotary parlor from Island we're up to 750 mm milk in a single hour after feed they then go to sleep on brother mattresses to keep the Rays of the warm ground the company's vice president says there was too much competition from other Gulf countries before the blockade to get a share in the market it's open big opportunities for this entrepreneurs in order to develop themselves develop their own companies by creating small and medium sized companies in order to fulfill the gap and now he's looking to expand beyond Qatar we are planned to expand more by the end of the year by bringing two more shipment in order to start exporting to outside qatar and we will be targeting first like 20 countries of the 1 billion dollars worth of all food imports to cut it 3 years ago the Saudis and the United Arab Emirates sold about 1/3 so who else is filling the gaps in the market now we were also able to find alternative products especially for a lot of the detergents and a lot of the food supply also through Turkey Mon Lebanon Morocco Tunisia Algeria Europe all across Europe for every product there is a hundreds hundreds and hundreds for number of products if you if you close one door there is a thousand doors that are open for many countries the blockade was a wake-up call towards self-sufficiency and it's allowed new international investors to take a slice of the pie to lure about in Manly al jazeera Doha we keep talking about the impact of this blockade on the economy on supply lines on political relationships but the human cost of the blockade pretty much immeasurable you know cutters National Human Rights Council says the blockade affected more than 13,000 people over 4,000 cases of human rights violations were reported in the past year and it affected all aspects of daily life education health care the right to perform religious rituals whole property freedom of movement and perhaps most crucially the right to fan reunification remember this is a region where family ties go beyond borders and yet the blockading nations forcibly deported cutleries and separated children from their parents they also crack down on their own nationals for expressing any sympathy for Qatar by fixing jail terms and penalties so there's a really important people story to tell here Victoria Gaytan B is going to do that the political crisis in the Gulf is threatening to tear this family apart Wafaa alia ziddi is Qatari but her children are Bahraini citizens in gulf countries children take the citizenship of their father Rasheed's Bahraini passport runs out next year he believes if he continues to defy an order by Bahrain to leave Qatar he'll lose his Bahraini passport and be stateless once my passport expires what do I do do I stay here and not pursue my future because I don't have a passport because I did not want to go to the country that I hold the citizenship nothing else but the citizenship then that's some sort of leverage that they have against me it's not just families living in limbo students to have had their lives turned upside down last year at least 700 Emirati Bahraini and saudi students were forced to abandon their courses at universities like this one in Qatar after they were ordered to return home by their governments hundreds of Qatari students were sent back to Doha unable to complete their courses or take their final year exams we spoke to students at Georgetown University in Qatar in the days following the blockade being imposed and again one year on to find out what life has been like since you see that suddenly these students don't have records you see that they're being exiled from their education which is a right you see that they have to start all over again sometimes in certain cases and then they're not granted access the way they're supposed to so it's been a very ugly war against education and humanity as a whole I know someone whose education was personally disrupted she was a medical student approaching graduation in the UAE and he had to come back to Qatar and when the National Human Rights Committee contacted her university asking for our files they said that they have no records of her files of her ever being a student cattles Human Rights Committee has urged the UN to intervene after one year they continues to use the people and use the civilians as the make pressure for Qatar government but in the same things they are fail and they are they cannot achieve anything to use the people in this crisis the Gulf crisis is a diplomatic dispute between governments but its consequences are being felt by people in a way they wouldn't have imagined a year ago Victoria Gaytan B al-jazeera Doha in any crisis like this the media is crucial there's been a lot of coverage in this part of the world much of it full of rhetoric and propaganda on the airwaves and online and there was the less than subtle demand that the al Jazeera media network be shut down something we've obviously rejected outright here is Richard gisbert from The Listening Post with more once Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates Bahrain and Egypt all sever ties with Qatar on the 5th of June last year the region's news media were quickly deployed to play their part in the diplomatic showdown the rift was triggered by a piece of news that mysteriously appeared on the website of the Qatar News Agency although the qna denies putting it there the country's Emir was quoted in that piece making incendiary remarks about regional leaders and purportedly criticizing Donald Trump as well as praising Iran news reports have since emerged alleging that operatives in the UAE were behind that hack however in the days that followed media outlets in the Gulf especially from Saudi Arabia and the UAE seized on the fake story and rolled out what seemed to be a coordinated campaign to put pressure on Qatar the political crisis in the region played out in an unusually public way and over the past year a spat that would have traditionally been managed behind closed doors was aired across the news media coverage designed to portray Qatar as a regional sponsor terrorism did a lotta hoie rajesh khattar with amelia her blatant focus area lemme lemme alan is really messy demon half rahim Akram fearless Allah to Allah Allah Allah al queda latina and pecan women and rule Korea Doha has refused to see to any of its adversaries demands among them the closure of this network al Jazeera or as Egyptian news anchors call the network al kanjiru the pig and the media battle has not just been waged within the region it is spread across to the United States where both sides hit the airwaves with official voices to fight in their corners and in the case of Katara's Emir to defend his country's news network when he told me to close a channel like Al Jazeera history were right one day and fifty or sixty seventy years how it changed the whole idea of free speech in the region however most of what's been going on in Washington has happened away from the cameras Saudi Arabia the UAE and Qatar have all spent millions of dollars on public relations and political lobbying as they seek to strengthen ties with the Trump administration and to bring the US media on side it is within the region itself where most of the public side of this is being fought on the airwaves one year on though the standoff continues and there is still no sign of Al Jazeera going to black and it goes further because media coverage is one thing media campaigns are quite another and there have been these concerted particularly by outlets in Saudi Arabia and the UAE and particularly using social media his Andrew Chappell with more the opening shots were fired by an army of BOTS on Twitter now bots are software that can be programmed to interact with other twitter accounts on their own to spread whatever message you programmed them to you just tell them what to do you can even build or buy an army of bots hundreds or thousands of them to flood twitter with your ideas boosting a conversation or hashtag until it takes off on its own to even make them trend in your city or country in April 2017 weeks before the summit in Riyadh where US President Trump called on Arab and Muslim leaders to drive out the dares and drive out the extremes thousands of Arabic language BOTS appeared on Twitter flooding it with sectarian messages and Nancy cats are propaganda they began shaping the online debate on terrorism a lot of the rhetoric that these BOTS were promoting on Twitter was similar to the demands that were later made so for example one of the bots trends was was about Qataris bankrolling of terrorism and these occurred obviously before the African news when the news of the hack surfaced one of the bot networks revealed that there were bot accounts set up in April 2017 so these bot accounts and the large network was set up a month before the news of the of the hack and they became active at the announcement of the news of the tank you can see that a lot of the narratives been spread by these BOTS here is the narratives of the core tech countries it'll be interesting to see how matters play out in this region as Twitter works to weed out bot armies in the meantime political agendas are being pushed by all these active users who are actually BOTS you know in four years from now Qatar will host the FIFA World Cup a massive project and what will be a landmark moment in the country's history but there's a lot to do and Joanna Gaza ROVs has been looking at how the blockades affected preparations for the big tournament the World Cup was awarded to Qatar eight years ago and preparations began almost immediately after FIFA's announcement for the last year they've continued despite the political dispute and the air sea and land blockade now there was some disruption to the supply of construction material initially but organizers say that all eight stadiums are on schedule with several expected to be ready by 2022 years ahead of the tournament as the Middle East's First World Cup Hosting committee is hoping that it can still bring the region closer together we recognize that power for what it means for people I want to say our people it's not guitar when I say our people it's the Arab world in the Middle East and it will always be worth it and will always continue being worth it we suffered abuse yes we suffered abuse did we ever regret it no we'll never regret it well still the national and club teams have felt the pressure of politics on the pitch December's golf camp had to be moved from Qatar to Kuwait at the last minute but on a club level Asian Champions League matches went ahead in Qatar and away from football Qatar has continued to host big-name sport stars and its annual top-level tennis competitions it held golf's Qatar Masters and athletics diamond league meet in May and next year it will host its highest profile athletics events so far the world championships I think it's very important the Qatar is getting itself out there with regards to sports sports competitions and basically saying you know we're still operating as a country or an independent country and also trying garner some empathy I'm sure for from international sporting crowds a member of the royal family tweeted not too long ago that Qatar will beard and get the Olympics at some stage there's only a few countries that can actually host them so Qatar has a chance that way though we bring up the dreaded conversation about Qatari weather again but yes I think there's no doubt that they will bid they will bid for the Olympics place and X Games whatever the future holds for Qatar in this crisis it's sporting ambition has only grown stronger over the last year you'll have seen this plenty the artistic image of Qatar zamir which became a real focal point of this past year but don't think this is about just one image the Blockheads been a driving force for artists and artistic expression in Qatar SATA higher it walks us through the changing art scene now and how people have found inspiration through crisis this converted by station here in Doha was transformed several years ago into an art gallery and workshop space it's become a hub for the artistic community here in Qatar and in the last 12 months it's taken on a life of its own the walls have been turned into massive canvasses showcasing young local talent and their take on the Gulf crisis five artists and ten days that's all it took to create these large-scale graffiti images all inspired by the blockade in cotton Bulgarian artist Dmitri pokrovsky created this piece covered in words of positivity like forward and love away he says to convey the unity that quatre YZ have been feeling since the blockade started last June the continuing blockade has energized artists in different ways murder in photos theories blockade energy drink has been to Paris and back and the artist who describes herself as a political art unas there she's found humor in the irrationality of the situation and just down the road and along the Arabian Sea lies katas cultural village Katara it's modern twist on arabic inspired architecture as reflected in the type of art displayed here whether it's by catari or expert artists this project called beyond appearances was born out of the situation people living in cotton found themselves in it's about perception an exchange of ideas and views life changes even and the journey itself this huge neon sign by Martin Creed is hard to miss here at the Museum of Islamic art it's minimalistic with a big impact and it was newly created especially for the blockades one-year anniversary but its message is simple that everything is going to be alright Saira Haider al Jazeera Doha and that is it for our Gulf crisis one year special a crisis that as you will have seen doesn't really look like it's ending anytime soon so you can be sure that we here at al-jazeera will continue reporting on it just as we always have even though we've unwittingly become part of the story itself I'm Kemal santamaría from the halt here in Doha thanks for joining us we're going to leave you now with the personal thoughts of some of the people of Qatar on this 5th of June 2018 after a year under blockade
