about I have to tell you what I saw in New York because it has given me a new theory of Donald Trump which I haven't heard anybody else say or anybody else noticed now you have to understand I'm in New York a lot I'm in at least three times two or three times a year so it's not like it's it's not like things change vastly when I go from one time you to another but I'm there for Christmas it's freezing cold absolutely freezing like 15 degrees on a good day and first first of all the city is booming I mean everything is great the this Christmas is obviously going well everybody's happy everybody's flush but I started to notice that first people were aggressively aggressively saying Merry Christmas and it's not just me people had stopped saying Merry Christmas they had started saying happy holidays and even I the most politically incorrect human being on earth the person who really that I'm not politically correct as I don't pay enough attention to be politically correct I don't care what people say is politically correct but even I had stopped saying it kind of on the idea that I was offending people or something like this I even I and suddenly people were looking you in the eye and I'm not the only person who noticed this because I started talking to people about it and they all said yeah oh it definitely it's definitely happening people were looking you in the eye and going Merry Christmas and it was that kind of life I thought okay I'm already having a Merry Christmas but thanks for saying it but but it was aggressive the other thing that happened is I frequently always if I can open the door for women or allow women to enter elevators first maybe five or six times five or six times a woman turned to me and said that's so kind of you thank you so much but like that you know not like not like intentionally you know not like thanks a lot oh how nice thank you it was like turning to me facing me looking me in the eye saying the culture is changing the culture is Trump affine the culture is changing and it is changing in a dynamic way beneath the surface so people and in this in New York right this is the heart of liberal darkness this is a place where I heard people make the argument that Kim jong-un wasn't so bad because of Donald Trump disliked him he couldn't be so bad this is but but the culture changes as I keep telling trying to tell conservatives the culture change is almost unseen almost against people's will it just changes and this is something that is happening now I have I have two things I want to say about this the first is my old theory they're all theory I kind of introduced at the end of last year which is that Donald Trump is Randall Patrick McMurphy and for those of you who don't remember One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest which right now is an old book and an old movie One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is about an insane asylum that is run by the nurse ratchet and nurse ratchet pretends to be the sweet motherly all protecting all loving mother figure but in fact is a castrating horror of a nightmare who keeps these men sort of stuck in their own insanity and grinding their own wheels and really undercuts their manhood at every turn read Hillary Clinton Randal Patrick McMurphy is a kind of a jerk he's an you know a rowdy obscene violent law breaking character but he is the one person who was willing to stand up to nurse ratchet because he hasn't gotten any restraints on his personality his personality is so out of whack that he is willing to stand up to nurse ratchet no matter what it costs which ultimately of course is the question of the story my point about Donald Trump was that yes he is rude he is outlandish he does things that I may not approve of in terms of my life but he has broken this soft tyranny and it is the soft tyranny of insanity when I compare America to an insane asylum I'm not kidding when you consider let me think about this for a minute because you know it's kind of like dealing with your mother-in-law you know not to use a cliche but dealing with some relative that you don't like and you think she's saying hostile things about you it and she think that every comment she makes is secretly hostile but you can never convince anybody else because she never says anything that's openly hostile so she says you know that's a nice dress and you know what she means is you look like an idiot but you said well she said it was a nice dress and you think well that's okay you know but like no it's not and so and so the stuff happens in America stuff happens that we know is bad and we protested but we don't know in our hearts it's bad we don't really feel how bad it is so consider this for a minute surely surely the greatest problem of our time in terms of enemies in terms of foreign enemies is radical Islam is Islam Islamic terrorism and now the big question about Islamic terrorism is is it inherent in the Islamic philosophy is terrorism inherent in the Koran and in Islamic belief or is it a cancer that has grown on Islamic belief those both those things are possible I would like to hear experts debate that at length I'm not sure I can't really say I don't I don't feel like I have a deep enough relationship to the Koran or to Islam to know whether Islamic terrorism is somehow inherent in the faith or if it's a cancer on the faith that open to debate for eight years for eight years we had a president who would not say the word Islam in conjunction with terrorism there's only one kind of terrorism in the world today its Islamic terrorism that's the only kind there is everything else is an outlier everything else their terror viously there are gonna be two other kinds of terrorist but this so small it's such a piddlin fraction of the daily murder and mayhem that goes on in the name of Allah that you know this is a major major issue for eight years for eight years the President of the United States the most powerful nation on earth would not say the word Islam in connection with terrorism that that's not bad or good that's nuts that's insane that's why I'm saying talking about an insane asylum that's why I'm talking about Randal Patrick McMurphy same thing with men and women men and women are the same men and women there's no difference between men and women anything anybody says there is a sexist a man can be a woman a man can declare himself alone all this stuff insane insane Donald Trump is broken through that insanity and I and here's the second part of my theory and this is my new part of my theory all right this is a theory I'm just gonna put it forward and we can think about it all year we'll come back to it through the year to see if I'm right people like Donald Trump even when they hate him okay this is my theory that people like being free of insanity even if the guy who did it who freed them is Randall Patrick McMurphy somebody they don't want over their house people are happy people are happier to be able to say Merry Christmas it's insane not to say Merry Christmas it's insane to question every American holiday Thanksgiving is bad because Indians died and Columbus Day is bad because Indians died and Christmas is bad because Indians died or whatever happens on Christmas I I don't know what happened on Christmas to the Indians but it was I'm sure it was bad you know so all this stuff all this stuff is insane and people are happy to be free of insane and I think that this is something that is infecting the culture I'm talking about New York now is something that is infecting the culture of America even as CNN lies and NBC lies and the New York Times lies and say I mean listen you know Donald Trump made a his usual radio address and his end-of-the-year address listen to the way he talks okay this is cut number three listen to the way Donald Trump talks obviously he's praising his own accomplishments he's saying we accomplished all these wonderful things health care tax reform and jobs and the stock market bought about of ice-t and Isis is destroyed he's all touting his own things but just listen to the way he talks about the country this is cut number three optimism is everywhere enthusiasm is booming and the thrilling American adventure has never looked brighter we are facing all challenges with new solutions and we are seizing new opportunities with brimming confidence and boundless resolve because of you your patriotism your devotion your love for your family we will be able to pass on the blessings of American liberty and prosperity to our children and our grandchildren together we are protecting our magnificent heritage and reaching for glorious destiny glorious destiny optimism is everywhere America is great again now listen to Obama in 2013 now remember this is this is your second term right this clown has been in office you know mucking things up for now five years listen to Obama talk about America the combined trends of increased inequality and decreasing mobility posed a fundamental threat to the American dream our way of life and what we stand for around the globe we know that there are airport workers and fast-food workers and nurse assistants and retail salespeople who work their tails off and are still living at or barely above poverty and that's why it's well past the time to raise a minimum wage that in real terms if below where it was what her treatment was it often so the American Dream is dying says Obama and the only way we can fix it is by raising the minimum wage which is all the government can ever do is help the minimum right at all that can never do is codify mediocrity and that that was you know who wouldn't like Trump better and Trump some solution Obama's solution is a minimum wage Trump solution as he puts it is jobs jobs jobs that same species jobs jobs jobs and let me tell you something else this was in the wall on the wall street journal' front page this morning is for the first time in you know who knows how long wages are starting to rise they're starting to rise why because there's so many jobs that they have to pay more to get the best people there I do when there are a lot of jobs it becomes a buyers market it's great you know this is a great thing the wages are suddenly going up didn't take the government took the government to get out of the way it always takes the government to get out of the way of course people like Donald Trump of course they want to hear the things are going well look you can say well you know Obama was telling the harsh truth and Trump is lying but I don't think so I think Trump is talking something into Excel P to talk something into an existence part of the rise in the stock market has been his simple sound of the simple sound of optimism coming out of the president's mouth along with the rollback in regulations and the tax cuts and all this it part of it has just been the sound of optimism coming out of this guy of course people like him and I think people like him who think they hate him I think this and I think this is gonna show in the midterms I think a lot of the polls are off I'm not I can't say what the midterms are gonna be you usually lose seats in the midterms and it's still too early to tell but all I can say is that something is happening in the culture underneath all the talk and all the debates about this and that is something positive is happening because people are responding to the tone of this president and I you know I said to somebody while I was in New York I think I'm having a trump conversion experience because suddenly the way he talks is really amusing and entertaining and uplifting to me whereas before I was always a little doubtful of it so we'll see we will see but I think people like this president more than they will admit and more than they even know so let's talk about how that affects Iran but first let's talk about stamps

we'll have Michael Knowles coming on to discuss what's gonna happen in 2018 he actually knows I don't know how he's it's amazing that guy you know he doesn't he doesn't know what's happening now but he does know it's gonna happen in the future but this Iran story is a really dramatic story and I've been watching the coverage through my flu induced haze through the weekend and it really is I won't call it dishonest coverage I just think it's uninformed coverage now remember you know we've kind of been told that the brought there's broad support for the Iranian government among the Iranian people and this of course turns out to be completely untrue you know that just that of course not think these guys are stepping on their throats and have been for decades okay so in 2009 they rose up and Obama did nothing there was the green movement and this was based in the city was based in Tehran you know the people were rising up and and protesting the government and saying they were oppressed and Obama said nothing zero nada and his excuse and this is I keep this is what I'm talking about when I say the coverage has been uninformed his excuse was that if he if he supported the rebels that would give the mullahs the rulers the chance to say oh these guys were American agents it was an american-backed uprising now think about this for a minute okay this was a transparent nationalization a transparent lie that he that's why he did it I mean Netanyahu just the other day came out and supported the guys were in the street now because because he said if he didn't support if he didn't come out and say it if he didn't come out in state what he was what he had to say they were going to say it was an Israeli backed operation so it was the opposite reason but the thing is Obama was already trying to make this stupid deal with Iran right this deal with Iran that we would remove sanctions we'd give him all this money that we had frozen if they would say they if they would lie and pretend that they weren't going to build weapons that was the deal you know you lie and and the thing is they were lying about this I mean people don't remember this is the Ben Rhodes that Ben Rhodes interview in the New York Times in 2016 where he said man we pulled a fast one on you media guys and the media said wow yeah we really admire that that you lied to us you it was amazing this this was they said they told the press they told the press that Obama was pulling off this Ram deal because of the election of a moderate to the so-called moderate which I don't even know what that means in Iran the Hassan rouhani to the presidency right instead of Ahmed Ahmed energy odd so that was what allowed Obama to make this wonderful Iran deal but that was a lie it was a lie and and when they confessed it was a lie the press applauded their line it was a lie Obama had already been negotiating with Iran and reaching out to Iran while Ahmed energon was the president and achma the Nejad was a hardliner and it doesn't matter who's the president because the president doesn't run the country the country is run by the mullahs the religious guys led by what's-his-name Ayatollah Khomeini right Ayatollah Ali Khamenei so all of this stuff was a lie so Obama just like he did with the with not stopping the drug dealing by the Palestinian terrorists right which Politico is now revealed he didn't he pulled the DEA off that case so he could make this deal he sacrificed America's interests and he sacrificed the interests of freedom in order to make this stupid deal which has done absolutely nothing and and that is and one of the funny things is it's kind of backfiring now because the people saw all this money coming through rouhani x' big claims to fame in his own country was oh i made this deal with america we have all these billions they're sending us tens of billions of dollars including platforms full of cash that they're sending into the country and the people was kind of looking around the same hey you know we're still starving here you know we're still just getting by just but and they started to protest this time not in the cities not in the cities but in the surrounding areas in the countryside and it started to ignite so it started out it seems to have started out and it's hard some of this you know you don't really know what the how accurate the news is but it seems to have started out as an economic protest but now it's spreading they don't want to be oppressed anymore they don't want to be in this theocratic government women who are leading a lot of this women are taking off their you know those horrible cows they're forced to wear and it's throwing them in the street I mean this is why while Mattel is making Barbie he jabbed Barbie these these brave courageous women are taking their hijabs off which could cost them their lives they could die and by the way it's really wonderful to see Linda Sarsour and all the other pink cat feminists rushing to Sapporo no that's not happy I'm making that up that's not having and they're all feminists are doing nothing they're silent and so Donald Trump is doing the only right thing to do which is put the support of America behind people who love freedom wherever people rise up for freedom America should say yes you know we can't always give them we can't always give them arms we can't always give them money we can't always give them you know military support but at least we can give them moral support so Trump started tweeting he said the people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime all of the money that President Obama so foolishly gave them went into terrorism and into their pockets the people have little food big inflation and no human rights the u.s. is watching this is the right thing to do it's the only right thing to do and and let me just put down this this marker that the odds of this revolution succeeding I can't say it right they always seem slim when these things start you never know if it's going to carry things away but it is entirely possible that this may be the beginning of the end of the mainstream support of Islamic terrorism it may well be these guys Iran is the biggest supporter of terrorism in the world state supporter of terrorism in the world and it has served their people ill and in the best case scenario and I realize this is an optimistic best-case scenario in the best case scenario we are seeing the people of the Muslim world saying you know what we don't benefit from this at all we don't benefit from bombing the West we don't benefit from killing Israelis we don't benefit Israel disappear off the face of the earth tomorrow and all and the Middle East would have all the same problems all the same problem you know that they do not get anything out of this except a kind of firework show that makes them feel good about themselves because they have nothing else they have all that you know this energy there's no reason they can't have a working economy but they're there socialism and their theocratic recei is destroying them and if people start to find out it would be a beautiful thing and I just want to say before we go to Knowles I just want to say that it is despicable the way the mainstream media is supporting this regime this supporting this regime in order to support Obama in order to hide the fact that Obama did the cowardly dishonest thing to support in not supporting the Green Revolution of 2009 they're attacking Trump there's you know the New York Times runs a an op-ed from one of Obama's old you know State Department at hands saying you know what he should do he should keep quiet he should keep quiet and do nothing that's the way that's the way we handled this and and we already know it failed we know that that failed because the Green Revolution was crushed so we know Obama's ideas and practices failed so we know it's right to do something different it's ridiculous and on TV some of the stuff that has been said is just it makes you gag I mean let's just listen before we go to Knowles let's just listen to CNN International this is our what Damon and CNN International is an anti-american propaganda unit it has nothing to do with the news it is just a relentlessly anti-american socialistic piece of garbage and listen to what she says about America versus Iran it's coming out from the country's foreign ministry not only talking about the fact that they've viewed the government of President Trump as the greatest bearer of ill-will towards Iran but going on to say that the people of Iran give no value or credibility to such opportunistic expressions by the government or the person mr. Trump American officials through their conduct have not earned a place from which they can express massive sentiments as sympathies for the aware and engaged people of Iran now that's not just necessarily a rebuke of what the US president tweeted but also perhaps a reflection of just how frustrated not just Iran but other countries frankly are with the United States a lot of nations and their populations no matter how they feel about their governments in particular do perceive the United States as not really having a moral leg to stand on unbelievable that is unbelievable she is supporting the iranian foreign ministry's rebuke of President Trump because we don't have a moral leg to stand on the only reason we don't have a moral like to stand on is because Obama dealt with these people out of some weird connection of Israel hatred and bizarre visionary nonsense that made him blind to the fact that this is an evil regime that is unbelievable anyway this is insanity what you just heard was insanity and and Donald Trump all his personal flaws included has broken through that insanity and I am Telling You we're gonna test this theory out as the year goes on I think people like this more than they admit more than they know speaking of things we like more than we admit and more than we know and more than we should admit let's bring on Michael Knowles in this place it sure is it's good I have to say it's good to see you though I saw you just moments ago in New York that's true I saw you in New York although you look much less blurry now I see two of you over copious martinis in the middle of the night in town I have to tell you that if you do never do anything else for anybody else ever again you may have made your life worthwhile by introducing me to the Yale cocktail something I had never known before should we I guess we can tell the secret there's this place in Manhattan which is the Yale Club I and they serve a very famous martini and there's nothing really different about the martini it's just a regular martini except that there are two of them so you order it in there too and then what's nice is in the big room there they have portraits of all the presidents who graduated from some school at Yale so Clinton Ford Taft and both bushes there is always a seat available because nobody will sit in front of George W it was a really really fun night it really was and we should mention another Kingdom comes back on Friday and for the final three episodes I'm used to getting hate mail I you know obviously we get a lot of this yes I got a lot of very angry mail that we did you host the episode and it said who wants to listen to this interview with you guys bring back the next chapter so that that will come back on Friday all right all right so let's talk about what's coming up we you know Donald Trump is really in my opinion he's in a brilliant political position because he's accomplished so much in the first year that really he now can kind of pick and choose where he wants to go everybody is shocked I think this is why I was trying to think of some predictions that we could make for 2018 and I think well Trump will finally become tyrannical right that's good well maybe he'll become tyrannical maybe he'll get tax reform oh he already did that oh maybe he'll get defeat Isis militarily oh he already did that on and on and on and on the only thing obviously they're gonna hang their hat on is that Trump will be impeached Mike Pence will resign the house will elect Hillary Clinton speaker and then she'll finally become the president all will be all will be well that that prediction is as likely to come true as all of the other ones for 2017 and I think there are a couple actual predictions we can make now okay I try not to forecast the future with Donald Trump because it is impossible yeah he's very that's true he does the unexpected but I do think we can finally see campaign themes emerging you saw this Donald Trump finally signaled this so we know that the Democrats are gonna run on sex why are they gonna run on sex because their heads are in the gutter why else because Donald Trump has had an extremely successful first year so they can't run on the economy being in the doldrums the economy is currently at levels that Obama's economists said were impossible to reach again right foreign policy has been handled very ably not only if we not started on a nuclear war or Armageddon but things seem to be going pretty well he pulled us out of the Paris climate Accord we were told that that would destroy the world it hasn't he pulled us a repeal net neutrality we were told it would destroy the world it hasn't all of their hysteria hasn't come through so what can they do the only thing I can do is appeal to sex and call every man on in America a rapist and try to make that stick to him he has just signaled just within the last day or two his response to this campaign theme which is he tweeted out and said quote Democrats are doing nothing for Daka just interested in politics Daka activists and Hispanics will go hard against Dems will start falling in love with Republicans and their president we are about results ah and this is a continuation of his campaign theme one of his campaign themes from 2016 which is that he is about action politicians are all talk and no action and I think he's going to contrast that he's going to shine a light and say look the Democrats have to run on this tabloid trash because they have no accomplishments whatsoever and everything they predicted hasn't come true I think this is a great appeal this is a direct appeal he's able to do this very well because he feigns ignorance about ideological conflict haha so he's you know he did this with Chuck and Nancy he said I want to make a deal with Chuck and Nancy but the trouble is they want to raise our taxes and ruin the country so I don't see a deal so I think that that is gonna play really really well I think think about this too though you know he's in a position now where if he puts he's there's things that he wants to do that Democrats should be on board with right by any by any logic infrastructure right infrastructure I'm always dubious because infrastructure funding usually turns out to be graft funding as absolutely as it did with as it did with Obama you know that was Obama just threw away seven hundred billion dollars right that was all gonna be for shovel-ready projects oh yeah they weren't so shovel ready hahaha you know that that that stuff you but but we do need infrastructure we definitely need revamped infrastructure it's always gonna take some government funding to get that done so depending on how its funded it could be a positive thing but the point is it's something that Democrats should be on board with if he now goes and says give me infrastructure and they do their resistance thing if Chuck Schumer puts on his pink hat and you know sighs I know no I resist I resist they're gonna look like idiots they everybody is gonna say well wait a minute don't you guys do anything for a living you know the same with daca if he says yeah I'll give you daca but you gotta give me the wall and they say no it seems to me he can just go to the people say you know I tried to compromise what you know what am what am I gonna do so the Democrats are gonna be playing to their base but he's gonna be playing to the broader public I think and we know we know that the Democrats do this already Chuck Schumer was the lone Democrat voice against the Iran deal and then he the minute that Trump calls to rescind the Iran deal and rip it up he says no no no we can't do that why is that because he's just a hack and he's oppositional that's fine I sometimes wonder if Donald Trump has told the Democrats into trolling Donald Trump to be more conservative by that I mean he's a deal maker he easily could make deals with people he has some shared goals with Democrats infrastructure for exam yeah and yet because they opposed him tooth and nail it's backed him into this conservative corner which is great for us I'm pretty pleased with it and I hope he keeps offering them little olive branches and I hope that they keep smacking it down it will only advance our agenda I think that's that's absolutely right you know Ben and I had the conversation I don't know when we were in Texas away it must be a year ago and and and Ben said you know what what what do you see is the good path forward and I said well let's say he gets tax reform and the economy then takes off I said then he's going to do stuff that's gonna drive you should Piro crazy like infrastructure and stuff like that and you're not gonna like it but at the same time it puts him in this position of of power because the Democrats have to play along or die and so if that happens and if the economy takes off you're looking not only at a reelected Trump if he lives if he gets loses some weight Stace a lot but you're also looking at a president pence I mean we'll have a Republican president for years if the economy strong is I personally think it's gonna become and if we have to pass some lefty bills or even infrastructure with a lot of craft in it or whatever yeah first of all all Republicans do this I once talked to a well-known conservative writer and thinker that I won't name and he said well Bush had to pass Medicare Part D he wouldn't have gotten elected otherwise he had to expand certain entitlements he wouldn't have gotten elected otherwise if we need to pass an infrastructure bill to get a more good conservative governance I suppose I can live with that because I don't predict that this will happen in 2018 but I do see it coming down the pike which is something I thought was impossible with Donald Trump and that is entitlement reform yeah let's talk about that he signaled this a couple months ago in a speech in Missouri and coincidentally at the same time Marco Rubio and Paul Ryan also signaled to turn toward this Paul Ryan has been salivating and chomping at the bit as he came out of the womb and so that is the number one driver of our debt and deficit the long-term fiscal problems that we face are driven by those programs Donald Trump campaigned and said I won't touch Social Security but then in this speech in Missouri he reframed and he said well we need welfare reform we need welfare reform now these programs I suppose they are welfare programs they're handouts from the federal government albeit ones that we pay into if Donald Trump can pivot on this can touch that third rail he hasn't been afraid of touching other third rails in politics if any politician would be willing to do it willing to do what other politicians think is suicide it would be this guy if he could do that it would be the greatest conservative governance probably since Coolidge it really would be amazing and the thing about Trump is I've said from the beginning is he obviously learned stuff you know he comes he's easily such he's so weird that he just will step into a a situation that he knows nothing about with complete confidence but he does pay attention and in in this time it would not surprise me if he had learned that Ryan is right about this you know that this entitlement has to be has to be reformed in order to be saved I mean I you know I'd probably get rid of it myself I'm such a cold-hearted user scrooge like individual I just want to throw granny offically yeah that's like exactly but but I mean even even this fact the simple fact that this that social security was framed when people died at 63 you know that was the average the lifespan was 63 and it kicked in at 65 so it's good just what we're paying that's that same thing as now when people live to be into their 70s and 80s and can work you know if you would have to work another three years before you get it is that gonna that's not gonna kill people you know that's it's not the worst thing in the world when life is much longer than it used to be I I think it's possible I don't think it's possible in a midterm election year certainly not I don't think he'll touch it before 2018 before the elections in 2018 but you are right he does learn things in the evidence of his learning things is to compare President Trump to candidate Trump to compare the things that President Trump says and does to the frequently insane things that candidate Trump said and did he had no idea we're just talking about right yeah and now he thought all right what one last thing I think I think we have to pin it what do you what do you think give us a guess on the 2018 midterms I'm withholding much judgment I the the one thing I know is that we have to distrust the consensus yeah so the consensus view is that we're gonna get blown out we're gonna lose the house by a lot we might lose the Senate I just don't buy that I don't even really buy much public opinion polling in the age of Trump because it is so taboo it is so unfashionable to say that you support this guy even as a Republican even as a conservative that I think they're that silent majority that has cropped up during the Richard Nixon's time during Ronald Reagan's time I think we could see that again and so my only prediction is that if Democrats make gains they will be much more modest than then is being predicted right now by the mainstream media but if we get four percent economic growth in 2018 I don't see us really losing despite all of the historical record that shows the incumbent party losing seats in the midterms it could be a it could be a brand new day I I hate to say it but I'm on exactly the same page I'm not willing to predict it yet but I kind of suspect it's gonna be much different than people say it is all right noise what's on the show today today obviously we're singing about the ninth day of Christmas when the Shah 20:18 maker Ron great again campaign was launched on the ninth day of Christmas the Iranians gave to me the death of Ayatollah Khamenei all right sounds good the Michael Lowell show is up next thanks a lot though all right let's end sexual follies so this may be this is a story that came up it came up again but in the new year but it had come up before in the old year and maybe the in a way the silliest story I've ever heard a metadata study published in the journal infant and child development by Johnny berry of University College London Institute of wind himself as well as colleagues from other universities has found that young children tend to prefer toys type to their gender according to the abstract after examining the studies which were conducted in multiple countries across 36 years with significant sample size of 1,600 children almost infinitely divided between boys and girls the researchers found that boys played with male type toys more than girls did and girls played with female toys more than boys did so boys like boy stuff and girls like girl stuff and you know what what is so interesting about this is how hard you have to work to keep this information from the public my daughter faith Moore who writes over at PJ Media their lifestyle page has a piece called feminists Princeton's princess play important for girls but only if princesses are sword wielding warriors and this is what's really interesting about this as faith points out there's an article in the New York Post saying that girls like princesses but includes as princesses Wonder Woman and Princess Leia and Shira you know the people but that's and they quote the study from an old Psychology Today article from 2015 that says the princess play is good for girls and acts like princess says the princess play is good for girls the girls like princess play and it's good for them and then it says yes well look at Shira and Wonder Woman but that's not what the Psychology Today article talks about it's talking about little pink princesses who have tea their friends over for tea that is the type of princess play that girls like they actually don't necessarily prefer being Wonder Woman or Shira or whatever they prefer being Cinderella and noting that the feminist has done over all this let me a feminists are terrible it's just an awful thing so what I wanted to point out about this is that is that if you listen to the way that people react to that the lefts reacts especially feminists react to people who disagree with them it's always by attacking them so for instance if you're male you can't speak because why would a male get to say anything about women if you're white or something or privilege whatever it were you're old and this is one of the biggest ones is when an old guy because he's old guys are tough right because we we don't have anything to lose so we'll say anything because what you know we've already got ours as far as women are concerned you know I don't have anything they'll say well you're old you're have you heard this they do it all the time Andy Rooney said he didn't like seeing the old commentator on 60 minutes who's now passed away but Andy Rooney said he didn't like seeing women do football commentary I don't really like watching women do football commentary either I never quite believe that they know what they're talking about but you know he was just absolutely flagellated for being old he's 80 what's wrong with you you're 80 you can't you know what yeah so the only thing I want to say about this is just think about how that emphasizes the State of Mind of white men in other words if I said if I said to women it would be you would be happier if you were a homemaker and a rear of children if I said that I'm not necessarily saying I don't think each person is different but if I said that and you said well you're being a paternalistic white male old guy you know what what does that have to do with whether my statement is true or not it had simply has to do with the state of white men and I think that everything the left does is really about white people everything the left does is really about privileges white people like if a white guy says you know blacks would be happier not having children out of wedlock and everybody says you're white you can't say how does that help black people it doesn't it just it basically just emphasizes what white men should be like it privileges white men so all I want to say about this is that girls will be girls and boys will be boys and in if we are afraid to talk about this stuff and I think so many of us are I hear so many people moaning and complaining about feminism behind the scenes who will not go and say what I say which is I am opposed to feminism itself I'm not opposed to individuals making their own choices I'm very much in favor of that but I am opposed to the philosophy of feminism if we don't say that stuff we live in the madhouse that's the thing we're trying to get out of the madhouse for eight years under the Obama administration the madhouse surrounded us personally I think it has surrounded us for 50 years I don't think it matters who's in the White House if the culture around us just supports this insanity it's going to continue to do that until we say no until we stop watching and agreeing with and being afraid to say what we have to say okay tomorrow the
