1
00:00:00,497 --> 00:00:01,297
DECISIONS GOING FORWARD I

2
00:00:01,297 --> 00:00:03,266
HOPE THEY CHOOSE CORRECTLY

3
00:00:03,266 --> 00:00:05,168
TO STAND WITH US.

4
00:00:05,168 --> 00:00:05,835
>> Neil: CONGRESSWOMAN THANK

5
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:06,336
YOU VERY MUCH.

6
00:00:06,336 --> 00:00:06,803
SAFE TRAVELS.

7
00:00:06,803 --> 00:00:08,805
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

8
00:00:08,805 --> 00:00:10,273
>> Neil: DID HAVE IMPACT ON

9
00:00:10,273 --> 00:00:11,541
WALL STREET INITIALLY MORE

10
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:11,908
CONFUSION.

11
00:00:11,908 --> 00:00:13,510
IN THE END THE MARKETS SORT

12
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,178
OF SHRUGGED AND ALL RIGHT

13
00:00:16,178 --> 00:00:17,714
CECE IT THING STILL GOING

14
00:00:17,714 --> 00:00:17,981
ON.

15
00:00:17,981 --> 00:00:19,249
INTERESTING PROXY IS THE

16
00:00:19,249 --> 00:00:19,849
10-YEAR NOTE.

17
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:21,684
THAT FINISHED THE DAY AT A

18
00:00:21,684 --> 00:00:21,985
HIGH.

19
00:00:21,985 --> 00:00:23,720
LEVELS WE HAVE NOT SEEN

20
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,290
SINCE 2011.  CLOSE TO 3.10%.

21
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,992
AGAIN, MANY LOOK AT THAT AS

22
00:00:28,992 --> 00:00:31,394
AN ACKNOWLEDGE MANY

23
00:00:31,394 --> 00:00:33,563
AN ACKNOWLEDGE MANIMENT THAT

24
00:00:33,563 --> 00:00:34,664
AN ACHE -- ACKNOWLEDGMENT

25
00:00:34,664 --> 00:00:36,599
HERE THAT PICKING UP STEAM.

26
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:38,134
SEE THE NORTH KOREANS WALK

27
00:00:38,134 --> 00:00:40,003
AWAY FROM TALKS NOT LIKELY

28
00:00:40,003 --> 00:00:40,737
TO HAPPEN.

29
00:00:40,737 --> 00:00:43,039
AT LEAST THAT'S THE INITIAL

30
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:43,339
READ.

31
00:00:43,339 --> 00:00:44,507
FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WITH

32
00:00:44,507 --> 00:00:45,575
MORE ON WHAT HAPPENED.

33
00:00:45,575 --> 00:00:45,909
DEIDRE.

34
00:00:45,909 --> 00:00:48,411
>> NEIL, THE CATALYST REALLY

35
00:00:48,411 --> 00:00:49,045
ACCORDING TO TRAITORS I

36
00:00:49,045 --> 00:00:50,180
SPOKE WITH EARLIER WAS

37
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,548
REALLY THAT APRIL RETAIL

38
00:00:51,548 --> 00:00:52,615
SALES DATA THAT WE GOT

39
00:00:52,615 --> 00:00:54,384
REALLY ON THIS MORNING WHICH

40
00:00:54,384 --> 00:00:56,653
JUST SHOW THAT OUR ECONOMY

41
00:00:56,653 --> 00:00:58,288
IS GOING ALONG AT A GOOD

42
00:00:58,288 --> 00:00:59,889
PACE AND MORE THAN LIKELY

43
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:02,325
WILL KEEP THE FED ON PACE TO

44
00:01:02,325 --> 00:01:03,460
INCREASE RATES.

45
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,462
SO BOND PRICES SOLD OFF WITH

46
00:01:05,462 --> 00:01:06,396
STOCK WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT

47
00:01:06,396 --> 00:01:08,598
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT

48
00:01:08,598 --> 00:01:09,699
PUSHING 10 YEAR YIELDS TO

49
00:01:09,699 --> 00:01:10,867
NEAR SEVEN YEAR HIGHS.

50
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:12,469
AS YOU WELL KNOW, MORTGAGE

51
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:15,438
RATES ARE TIED, THEY USE

52
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:17,474
THIS TENURE AS A BENCHMARK

53
00:01:17,474 --> 00:01:17,774
PRICE.

54
00:01:17,774 --> 00:01:20,743
SO YOU NOW HAVE MORTGAGED

55
00:01:20,743 --> 00:01:22,445
DAMAGE RATES SURGING TO

56
00:01:22,445 --> 00:01:22,946
HIGHEST LEVELS.

57
00:01:22,946 --> 00:01:24,080
SOMETHING THAT NEW HOME

58
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,381
BUYERS ARE GOING TO BE

59
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:26,349
MONITORING PRETTY CLOSELY.

60
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:27,550
THAT APRIL RETAIL SALES

61
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:28,985
REPORT JUST INDICATED THIS

62
00:01:28,985 --> 00:01:30,053
RISING INFLATION.

63
00:01:30,053 --> 00:01:31,154
AND IF YOU PAIR THAT NEIL,

64
00:01:31,154 --> 00:01:32,155
WITH WHAT WE SAW IN THE

65
00:01:32,155 --> 00:01:33,823
ENERGY MARKET, RIGHT?

66
00:01:33,823 --> 00:01:36,593
OIL ROSE 71.31 A BARREL.

67
00:01:36,593 --> 00:01:37,827
THAT'S NEAR A THREE AND A

68
00:01:37,827 --> 00:01:38,661
HALF YEAR HIGH.

69
00:01:38,661 --> 00:01:39,762
THAT ALSO JUST CONTRIBUTES

70
00:01:39,762 --> 00:01:47,403
TO THIS INFLATION STORY.

71
00:01:47,403 --> 00:01:48,605
FIRST TIME I HAVE SEEN IT

72
00:01:48,605 --> 00:01:52,242
THIS YEAR 51% CHANCE OF A

73
00:01:52,242 --> 00:01:53,776
FOURTH INTEREST RATE HIKE

74
00:01:53,776 --> 00:01:55,512
FROM THE FED WHEN THE

75
00:01:55,512 --> 00:01:56,980
PREVIOUS EXPECTATIONS OR

76
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,448
CONSENSUS SEEM TO BE 3.

77
00:01:58,448 --> 00:01:59,782
NEXT FED MEETING IS ON

78
00:01:59,782 --> 00:02:00,149
JUNE 12TH.

79
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:01,150
A LOT OF INVESTORS ARE GOING

80
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,318
TO BE PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION

81
00:02:02,318 --> 00:02:03,486
TO THAT.

82
00:02:03,486 --> 00:02:05,054
SO, BIGGER PICTURE THOUGH,

83
00:02:05,054 --> 00:02:05,755
INVESTORS SOMETIMES LOOK AT

84
00:02:05,755 --> 00:02:07,423
THE MARKET AND SAY HEY, IF I

85
00:02:07,423 --> 00:02:09,157
CAN GET 3% RETURN FROM A

86
00:02:09,157 --> 00:02:10,727
BOND MARKET, WHICH IS BUYING

87
00:02:10,727 --> 00:02:12,795
THIS VERY LOW RISK PRODUCT

88
00:02:12,795 --> 00:02:14,430
OF U.S. GOVERNMENT DEBT,

89
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,699
MAYBE THAT'S MORE ATTRACTIVE

90
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:18,334
TO ME IN COMPARISON TO THE

91
00:02:18,334 --> 00:02:20,937
STOCK MARKET.

92
00:02:20,937 --> 00:02:22,505
ESPECIALLY WHETHER YOU HAVE

93
00:02:22,505 --> 00:02:23,940
SOME PEOPLE INVEST IN THE

94
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,374
STOCK MARKET.

95
00:02:24,374 --> 00:02:26,476
WE HAVE HAD 9 YEAR BULL RUN

96
00:02:26,476 --> 00:02:27,710
FOR STOCKS AT SOME POINT

97
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,711
THEY ARE GOING TO FALL A

98
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:29,279
LITTLE BIT.

99
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:30,346
AND THEN HAVE

100
00:02:30,346 --> 00:02:30,380
AND THEN DAVE

101
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:30,580
AND THEN DOVE

102
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,247
AND THEN DO HAVE BONDS

103
00:02:31,247 --> 00:02:32,582
BEGINNING TO LOOK A LITTLE

104
00:02:32,582 --> 00:02:33,750
BIT MORE ATTRACTIVE.

105
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,118
TAKING A LOOK WHAT'S AHEAD,

106
00:02:35,118 --> 00:02:36,152
INVESTORS, OF COURSE,

107
00:02:36,152 --> 00:02:36,786
CONTINUING TO MONITOR.

108
00:02:36,786 --> 00:02:38,454
YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT

109
00:02:38,454 --> 00:02:39,522
THESE DEVELOPING HEADLINES

110
00:02:39,522 --> 00:02:41,858
ABOUT THE POTENTIAL SUMMIT

111
00:02:41,858 --> 00:02:44,027
OR AS THE STATEMENT

112
00:02:44,027 --> 00:02:44,861
DEPARTMENT SAYS SUMMIT

113
00:02:44,861 --> 00:02:45,528
BETWEEN THE U.S.

114
00:02:45,528 --> 00:02:46,596
SOUTH KOREA, AND THE NORTH

115
00:02:46,596 --> 00:02:47,997
KOREA AND, OF COURSE, WE ARE

116
00:02:47,997 --> 00:02:49,198
STILL MONITORING TRADE.

117
00:02:49,198 --> 00:02:51,401
>> YOU KNOW, CHINA AND THE

118
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:52,869
U.S. HAS BEEN DESTABILIZING

119
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:54,237
THE MARKETS OR AT LEAST

120
00:02:54,237 --> 00:02:55,572
INVESTORS HAVE BEEN

121
00:02:55,572 --> 00:02:56,839
DESTABILIZED BY THESE TRADE

122
00:02:56,839 --> 00:02:57,440
NEGOTIATIONS GOING ON

123
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,708
BETWEEN THE TWO LARGEST

124
00:02:58,708 --> 00:02:59,442
ECONOMIES IN THE WORLD.

125
00:02:59,442 --> 00:03:00,910
AND THEN, OF COURSE, THE

126
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,512
U.S. ALSO LOCKED IN

127
00:03:02,512 --> 00:03:03,846
NEGOTIATIONS OVER TARIFFS

128
00:03:03,846 --> 00:03:05,415
WITH EUROPE AND JAPAN.

129
00:03:05,415 --> 00:03:06,783
SO, NEIL, INVESTORS HAVE AN

130
00:03:06,783 --> 00:03:11,754
AWFUL LOT TO MONITOR THOSE

131
00:03:11,754 --> 00:00:00,000
ARE A FUTURECAST ELEMENTS
