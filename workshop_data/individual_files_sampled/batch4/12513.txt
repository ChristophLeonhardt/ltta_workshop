on Tuesday nearly a full day after Islamic terrorist Abdul Razak Ali Artin also not named Bob Smith ran a car into a group of students and then hopped out with a butcher's knife and began hacking away CNN still can't uncover a motive here's CNN's headline quote students back in class at Ohio State investigators searched for knife attack motive Ohio Governor John Kasich oh god no please God no not John Kasich has now announced quote we may never find out why Arjun committed this act of terrorism I have a hot lead it is called Facebook here was arjan's post just before entering into a personal jihad against Americans quote in the name of Allah the most merciful in the most gracious my brothers and sisters I am sick and tired of stealing my seeing my fellow Muslim brothers and sisters being killed and tortured everywhere seeing my fellow Muslims being tortured raped and killed in Burma led to a boiling point I can't take it anymore Americans stop interfering with other countries especially the Muslim Ummah we are not weak we are weak remember that wait what if you want us Muslims to stop carrying lone wolf attacks then make peace with dala in all sharm make a pact or a treaty with them where you promise to leave them alone you and your fellow apostate allies by Allah will not let you sleep unless you give peace to the Muslims you'll not celebrate or enjoy any holiday stop the killing of Muslims in Burma by the way every single Muslim who disapproves of my action is a sleeper cell waiting for a signal I am warning you o America and the message to the Muslims don't listen to celebrity scholars who sold their Deen I'm talking about the likes of Yasser Rafi Omar Suleiman Newman Mufti analyst goes on the aware of Al Maghreb Institute listen instead to our hero Imam Anwar al-aulaqi let me let me ask you this question if the Muhammad peace and blessings upon him and his Inaba were here today wouldn't the Western media call them terrorists to conclude by Allah I'm willing to use a billion infidels in retribution I I can't get it guys out Wow what drove this I can we need encyclopedia brown that must be on the case let's get him out there on his bicycle maybe he can uncover a motive in the great Ohio State stabbing attack I don't know the clues are just not there I can't make the connection the hot lead wasn't so hot the media have decided to make this about discrimination against Muslims of course here is CNN again quote back in August Ohio State's student-run newspaper profiled our time as part of its humans of Ohio State series obviously humans a little too seriously he had just transferred from Columbus State and talked about his struggles to find a place to pray in peace on the large campus unquote they neglect to mention that the end of that profile our town admits he engaged in prayer in the open with no consequences which is normal as an Orthodox Jew I pray three times a day in the mornings I pray with the tallest which is the prayer shawl and the tefillin which is the phylacteries you wrap them around the arm and on the head I have never been bothered or even approached while praying in public everywhere from campuses to airports this is America the most tolerant country on planet earth but the media have to pretend that Artin was a victim of the West rather than a perpetrator against it that by the way Springs from a deep-seated need to cast Western civilization in the negative light the media did the same thing after a spate of attacks in France an enormous series of stories broke about how friends had not been tolerant enough toward new Muslim immigrants you know aside from giving them welfare and taking them in in the whole deal because the left's chief priority in life is equality of outcome and because of what believes actions should have no connection with consequences the left has to connect all unhappiness and suffering not with individual decision making or bad ideology but with the system and the system is Islamophobic and that must be why art and was so upset and went on a stabbing spree or alternatively we may never know why this Islamic terrorist self-declared committed an act of Islamic terrorism you wanna know why Donald Trump won because of this sort of crap we all know why art and committed an act of terrorism it wasn't because of the lack of gun control or the evils of income inequality or any other stupid reason those who purposefully attempt to obscure the truth suggest it was because of radical Islam at least Trump will say the words unlike cowards from both the left and the right i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show all righty so we have tons to get to here today lots of lesson from Twitter fun that guys Twitter account is just going to be a barrel laughs for the next four years and he will definitely fill us up with good Trump bad Trump for years to come which is very exciting and again thanks to Brandon Snipes for the theme on that we'll get

completely gotten it wrong because this is what they do for a living there was this interview that this this attacker did with the lantern which is an Ohio State University publication and here's what this interview said it said humans of Ohio State and this is a direct quote from this guy who just wounded 11 people with a knife after driving car into them quote I just transferred for Columbus State we had prayer rooms like actual rooms where we could go to pray because we Muslims have to pray five times a day there's Faja which is early in the morning at dawn then xur during the daytime then oskar in the evening like right about now and Mallory abut which is like right at sunset and then each eye at night I wanted to pray asar I mean I'm new here this is my first day this place is huge and I don't even know where to pray I wanted to pray in the open but I was kind of scared with everything going on in the media I'm a Muslim it's not what the media portrays me to be if people look at me a Muslim praying I don't know what they're going to think what's going to happen but I don't blame them it's the media that put that picture in their head so there going to have to have it and it's going to make them feel uncomfortable I was kind of scared right now but I just did it I relied on God I went over to the corner and just prayed and nothing happened because no one cares because in America you can pray however you want and no one is going to bother you because again this is America but it does illuminate a couple of points that are pretty amazing number one in order for people to perpetrate acts of violence and terror they have to feel like they're victims people like to feel justified in what they're doing very few know TV makes all of the bad guys on TV people who are insanely barbaric and in sadists like if you watched Game of Thrones you know that the great villains and Game of Thrones people like Joffrey Baratheon or people like Ramsay Bolton these are all people who revel in other people's suffering and something they enjoy right they just like cutting parts off of people and they take a sick sort of pleasure in it the truth is the vast majority of people who commit acts of violence on earth are not sociopathic status they're not people who just sit around going you know what I'd really like to do cut a finger off somebody today the number of people who are like that is actually very very small in the human population it's really small Hollywood likes to build those people up as the real villains the real villains are always people who just enjoy the sadism for the sake of the sadism but that's a really small group of people most people who do evil things think they're doing something good right most people who were participating in the Holocaust thought that they were doing something good on behalf of the fatherland most people who participated in the mass killings in the Soviet Union literally people got so tired during the mass killings in the Soviet Union the soldiers got so tired from holding their arm out to shoot people in the head that they actually had people on staff masseuses on staff who had massaged the right arm and trigger-finger of the people who are pulling the gun because they were murdering so many thousands of people at a time in the Soviet Union those people they thought that they were heroes they thought they were doing something good right people always have to think they're doing something good there's not a person who's alive who doesn't have a way to justify their actions it's just the way the human brain works in fact Jonathan Hite who's sort of an ethicist and sociologist at New York University he wrote a whole book called the righteous mind in which he discusses the fact that the human brain is sort of like we tend to think that the reasonable side of us is what controls the human brain in reality he likens the human brain to a rider on an elephant the elephant is sort of you're in thinked of mind the elephant really tells you where to go and then the rider can sort of make small deflections is the path of the elephant but in the end the elephant rules that's how human beings really work we want to do certain things and then we come up with justifications later for the things that we're doing well one of the ways that you justify killing a bunch of innocent people at Ohio State University is not because you're a sadist and you want to watch people suffer you do it because you think you're a victim you build up in your own mind that you are the victim of an evil evil system that Islamophobia is targeting you and therefore you are acting in response right you're always punching back no one has ever been an offense an offender no one's ever an aggressor you're always punching back bin Laden if you read his his statements it was always about I'm taking revenge for X it was always I'm justified in doing what I'm doing because I'm reacting right I didn't start it you started it and that that's always what what evil people say it's what good people say too sometimes but they're the ones who are telling the truth so you have to build up the idea that you are a victim of Islamophobia so the Islamophobia narrative that was promoted by this guy is is point number one which is you have to feel justified in order to kill innocent people point number two and this is the part that's that's truly amazing is that you know he says in there that the media portray this really terrible vision of Muslims and that's why people view me badly no actually if people view Muslims badly it's because people who say that Muslims ought not to be viewed Adly drive trucks into groups of people and then stab them with butcher knives like that that would probably be it right this guy who's saying I don't understand why people see Muslims so badly if they do it's because of people like you and we shouldn't paint of course all Muslims with the brought with the brush of this terrorist that's silly but it is worthwhile noting that the same guy who's complaining about media coverage of Islam is the guy who drove a truck into the middle of a group of people and then started hacking away with a butcher's knife and that is worth noting it is also worth noting that the Islamophobia narrative is a way to shut down debate it's a way for for people to simply suggest that you can't have real questions about how radical Islam works about the ideology of radical Islam whether it's promoting violence you just shout Islamophobia and that ends the conversation there's this suffix that the left loves to add to things then in that suffix is phobia and the reason they do that is because they want to suggest that your opposition to some activity is not rooted in reason or risk assessment your opposition to certain activity is rooted instead in an insane fear of things right so if you say that men are men and women are women for example and that men can't magically become women and women can't magically become men the response of the left is not that's scientifically false let me explain you how a woman is man because they can't do that instead their response is you're a trans folk right you're transphobic I'm not afraid of transgender people I don't know a lot of people who are afraid of transgender people I feel horrible for transgender people but the way that the left Act it's not if you believe this it's not because in any way you have science to back you it's because you are a phob right you fear so if you are concerned about radical Islam the left's response is well yeah that's because you fear Islam you have an irrational fear of Islam and radical Islam first of all fear of radical Islam is perfectly rational given the record of radical Islam around the world to women to gaz'd people of civilized nations everywhere to jews to christians there's plenty to fear from radical islam obviously but the left slaps the phobia label on their to label you pathological for having attitudes about people based on their own decision-making process you don't want to be called pathological you don't want to be called a weakling who lives in fear all the time and so instead you say okay well if i see somebody who is who may be engaged in something bad i'm not going to report it because I don't want people labeling me in Islamophobe that's the danger of labeling people phobic it's the danger of saying that somebody's pathological there's something wrong with their brain if they if they have a risk assessment about about a people a group of people who engage with a certain ideology again no one ever said nazi phobic right because Nazism was an evil ideology radical Islam is an evil ideology not Islam itself radical Islam now the Islam that says that honor killings are okay and that clitoridectomy czar worthwhile and that jews ought to be slaughtered behind the rocks and the trees where they hide that sort of islam is absolutely evil and should be fought and it's not phobic to say that right no one's Nazi phobic you just don't like Nazism it's a bad idea gee radical Islam is a bad idea tree not mainstream Islam not mainstream Islam radical Islam and there is a distinction westernized Muslims are not the same as as Muslims who are living in Afghanistan you can see by the polling data and one of the things I don't like to do here on the bench Shapiro show is get into textual analysis of the Quranic so I'm significantly more interested in what people do then in what people feel right I'm more interested in in behavior right there's lots of stuff in the Bible too that's pretty violent but judeo-christian tradition has basically read a lot of that stuff as either obsolete or inapplicable to today's situation and so how people act matters more to me than what the Bible says you know in terms of assessing how people think and act the same thing is true of Islam if you mean a moderate Muslim I judge them by behavior not by ideology the only reason ideology matters is if the ideology actually produces more violent people radical Islam does produce more violent people Nazism produces more violent people that makes a difference but I'm not going to sit here and analyze Quranic verses because there are a lot of people who interpret the Quranic verses in a moderate way which is good and there are a lot of people who don't which is bad so I'd rather analyze the philosophy of the people who are doing the bad things then try and lump everybody together that's why I don't bother doing the Quranic analysis which everyone's capable of doing and everybody has a different a different read okay so in other news from this Ohio State thing the media is trying to ignore that Islam had anything to do with that radical Islam had anything to do with it or political Islam more realistically had anything to do with it instead the media wanted to jump on the bandwagon about gun control so here is what as this thing was unfolding yesterday there were reports that there was an active shooter at Ohio State and normally when these things break the information is really really spotty right you don't know very much about what's going on because usually there are several different accounts they leave very often they'll say multiple shooters when it's really just multiple accounts of the same shooter in this particular case there was no shooter the shots that were being heard were from the cop who killed this this terrorist bastard so the left couldn't wait they immediately jumped to their narrative and they started tweeting here is Tim Cain well here Shannon Watts we mean start Tim Cain fine stick there's Tim Cain the the senator from Virginia and former vice presidential candidate deeply saddened by the senseless act of gun violence at Ohio State this morning praying for the injured and the entire Buckeye community so he's jumping immediately to the gun control argument right whenever the left says senseless act of gun violence what they really mean is let's ban guns number one it wasn't an active gun and number two it wouldn't have been senseless it was obviously driven by an ideology and evil murderous ideology he wasn't the only one Shannon watts who is a gun control leader she tweeted for school shooting victims it's not too soon to discuss our nation's lacks gun laws it's too late Ohio State University except there was no school shooting at Ohio State University it was a Muslim terrorist using a car and a knife and Adam Feldman who's a theater critic and I know that when I'm looking for solid political analysis I always go straight to the theater critics here is Adam Feldman what happened at Ohio State is terrible but math stabber leaves eight people with non-life-threatening injuries is why gun control matters first of all we have no evidence that this guy ever tried to even apply for a gun he probably could have gotten one legally there was nothing to stop him in the state of Ohio I assume beyond that you know this is a real strained argument so it's a no when your outcome is always the same to your argument there's something wrong with your argument so if somebody shoots people that's evidence that gun control is necessary and if somebody stabs people that's in that's evidence that gun control is working amazing amazing how that operates according to the left the left had to jump to their narrative it's it's very funny the left is talking a lot these days about fake news this is this big fake news controversy this idea that that people were driven to their various political perspectives by news that that confirms their bias there's truth to this but this is an example of how the left did it right so the reality is we're always looking for confirmation bias it's one of the reasons why on this program I really strive to sort of give you what I think are the unbiased sets of facts I make my perspective clear but I'm going to tell you the truth whether it benefits me personally or not right means during the entire election cycle I was very critical of Donald Trump that certainly didn't benefit me in any way you know when it comes to his presidency I'm going to call it like I see it I think that most people have a tendency to find a piece of news and then try and fit it into the puzzle of their thinking so everybody's everybody's world view has a set of holes that are to be filled by pegs every piece of news is a peg if the peg doesn't fit people try to ram it it anyway that's exactly what happened with the left on this story they wanted a gun-control peg to stick in their gun control worldview it was a square peg they tried to shove it in the round hole anyway and it ends making them look stupid as well it should here's my rule we should wait till all the facts are out this is true on police shootings it's true on black lives matter riots it's run all this stuff okay you should always wait and I don't always abide by this role I should I'm trying to hold myself to a higher standard on this we should always try to wait till the facts are out or at least base our opinions on the best available facts before we jump to a conclusion that confirms our worldview that's what we should do because otherwise we're not actually analyzing the news we're just hacks trying to trying to bolster what we already think about the universe and that's not really particularly useful to anybody you should let the evidence lead you to a conclusion rather than letting your conclusion lead you to the evidence okay we're going to have to break there but we have much more coming up I'm going to deconstruct the culture in a little while we're also going to talk about Donald Trump and flag-burning which is I
