1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,590
WILL
THE SUMMIT WITH NORTH KOREAN

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:07,410
LEADER KIM JONG UN AND TRUMP
STILL HAPPEN?

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,410
LAST WEEK TRUMP

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,450
HAD RELEASED A LETTER TO KIM
JONG-UN AND INDICATING THAT THE

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,180
SUMMIT WAS CANCELED FOLLOWING
SOME OF THE MORE SALTIER

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,789
RESPONSES THE US HAD RECEIVED
FROM NORTH KOREA.

7
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:20,789
NOW IT TURNS

8
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:23,890
OUT THAT MEMBERS OF TRANSIT
MINISTRATION AND TRUMP HIMSELF

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,439
ARE MAKING IT SEEM AS THOUGH THE
WHEELS ARE IN MOTION IN TERMS

10
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,979
OF MAKING THIS SUMMIT HAPPEN.

11
00:00:30,979 --> 00:00:36,090
FIRST, LET'S HEAR FROM TRUMP
LAST FRIDAY WHEN HE SAID MAYBE

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,930
THE SUMMIT CAN STILL HAPPEN.

13
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:38,930
TAKE A LOOK.

14
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:39,930
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

15
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:40,930
WE ARE TALKING TO THEM NOW, THEY
VERY MUCH WANTED TO DO IT, WE

16
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:52,000
LIKE TO DO IT, WE WILL SEE
WHAT HAPPENS.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,620
JOHN, EVERYBODY PLAYS GAMES.

18
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,620
YOU KNOW THAT.

19
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,620
YOU KNOW THAT BETTER THAN
ANYBODY.

20
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,620
EVERYBODY PLAYS GAMES, OKAY.

21
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,440
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT WHAT
IS CURRENTLY TAKING PLACE IS

22
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,280
JUST PART OF THE GAME PLAYING,

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,209
BUT WILL BE DO KNOW IS THAT KIM
YOUNG CHOL WHO WAS A NORTH

24
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:09,359
KOREAN OFFICIAL AND KIM JONG
UN'S RIGHT-HAND MAN IS

25
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:11,299
TRAVELING TO THE UNITED STATES

26
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:33,049
TO MEET WIT MIKE POMPEO, THAT IS
THE SECRETARY OF STATE.

27
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:34,049
SINCE HE

28
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:36,549
IS ON HIS WAY TO NEW YORK IT
APPEARS HE HAS BEEN GRANTED

29
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:38,240
THAT WAIVER.

30
00:01:38,240 --> 00:02:03,259
THERE ARE OTHER MOVING
PARTS TO 

31
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:11,850
THE STORY.

32
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,360
I'VE GOT TWISTS AND TURNS
TO THE STORY.

33
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,020
I LIKE WHAT TRUMP IS DOING.

34
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,900
WOAH, THAT IS A TWIST
RIGHT THERE.

35
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,900
I'M GLAD THEY

36
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,600
TALKED ABOUT THE NONSENSE NOBEL
PEACE PRIZE, THAT IS ANOTHER

37
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,080
TERM SO I WILL EXPLAIN ALL THAT

38
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,120
BUT FIRST I WANT YOU TO KNOW
ABOUT OUR FRIEND GEN.

39
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,120
KIM YOUNG

40
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:38,340
CHOL, HE IS BELIEVED TO HAVE
MASTERMINDED THE SINKING OF A

41
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,840
SOUTH KOREAN NAVY SHIP BACK IN
2010 THAT KILLED 46 SAILORS

42
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,650
WHILE SERVING AS THE TOP
INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL.

43
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,600
NOT A GOOD GUY.

44
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,050
BUT YOU DON'T NEGOTIATE WITH
YOUR FRIENDS, YOU NEGOTIATE

45
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,040
WITH YOUR ENEMIES.

46
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,340
I THINK THEY SHOULD'VE GRANTED
HIM A WAIVER, THERE IS SOME

47
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,240
DISPUTE AS TO WHETHER HE WILL BE
A FIXER AND THE NEGOTIATIONS

48
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,870
HAVE A ROADBLOCK TO THE
DENUCLEARIZATION THAT OR THEY

49
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,770
ARE ALMOST ALWAYS COMING IN TO

50
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:17,850
ANOINT THE TALKS AND SAY YES
THIS WILL BE THE DEAL BEFORE

51
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,840
THE TWO PRESIDENTS MEET.

52
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,460
IN THAT CASE I AM REFERRING TO
KIM JONG-UN.

53
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:30,700
WHY DO I SUPPORT

54
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,820
DONALD TRUMP?

55
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:38,900
JOHN BOHN AND MIKE PENCE WALKED
US TO THE EDGE OF DESTROYING

56
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,210
THESE PEACE TALKS.

57
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:45,800
AND I'M GLAD THE 18 HOUSE
REPUBLICANS WHO IN MY OPINION

58
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:54,210
ARE CRAZY ñ THAT CREATED SOME
SORT OF INCENTIVE FOR TRUMP AND

59
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:59,030
HIS EGO TO STAY ENGAGED WITH
THE PEACE TALKS.

60
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:03,490
IF HE COULD DOCK THE SHIP AND
DENUCLEARIZE NORTH KOREA AND

61
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,490
THEY ACTUALLY FALL THROUGH.

62
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:10,080
IF THEY DO THAT ALL THE CREDIT
IN THE WORLD TO DONALD TRUMP.

63
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,990
I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT IN TERMS
OF GIVING TRUMP THE CARROT.

64
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:20,510
EVEN MAINSTREAM MEDIA OUTLETS
THAT TYPICALLY ARE INCREDIBLY

65
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,530
CRITICAL OF TRUMP WERE
APPLAUDING HIS ATTEMPTS TO

66
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,530
NEGOTIATE.

67
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,660
I THINK TRUMP MORE THAN ANYONE
LOVES THAT KIND OF

68
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,500
COMPLEMENTARY COVERAGE
IN THE NEWS.

69
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,150
AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE THE
NEW YORK TIMES.

70
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:40,710
WHETHER IT IS THE DAILY OR THE
WAY THEY WROTE THEIR ARTICLES,

71
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:45,100
IT ALL SEEMED VERY CELEBRATORY
IN REGARD TO HOW TRUMP HAS

72
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,720
HANDLED IT SO FAR AND THEN WHEN
HE SENT OUT THAT LETTER LAST

73
00:04:48,720 --> 00:05:15,990
THURSDAY HE STARTED GETTING
SOME CRITICISM AGAIN.

74
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,690
NORTH KOREA WANTS SOME PRETTY
SIGNIFICANT CONCESSIONS IN ORDER

75
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:26,760
TO DENUCLEARIZE A COUPLE OF
YEARS AGO THERE WAS A GROUP OF

76
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,630
NORTH KOREAN RESTAURANT WORKERS

77
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:33,790
IN CHINA WHO EFFECTIVELY
DEFECTED AND WENT TO SOUTH

78
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,790
KOREA.

79
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:43,220
THEY ARE SAYING THEY WANT
THOSE WAITRESSES BACK.

80
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,440
I HIGHLY DOUBT SOUTH KOREA IS
GOING TO BE LIKE HERE YOU GO,

81
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,440
BUT WE WILL SEE.

82
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,919
THIS IS PART OF THE NEGOTIATION.

83
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:53,620
I
FEEL TERRIBLE FOR THOSE PEOPLE.

84
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:59,720
NORTH KOREA IS CLAIMING THE
SOUTH KOREANS KIDNAPPED THEM.

85
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,150
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT THEORY.

86
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,900
KIM YOUNG CHOL, ONE OF HIS JOBS
WAS TO SPREAD PROPAGANDA TO

87
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,710
SOUTH KOREA CONVINCE THEM TO
COME OVER TO NORTH KOREA.

88
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,600
PROBABLY ONE OF THE LEAST
EFFECTIVE PROPAGANDA PROGRAMS IN

89
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
WORLD HISTORY.

90
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,370
CAN YOU IMAGINE SOUTH KOREANS
SAYING IT IS REALLY GREAT IN

91
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,450
NORTH KOREA?

92
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:26,780
BUT WE HAVE SEEN PEOPLE GET
TRICKED INTO A LOT OF CRAZY

93
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,550
THINGS INCLUDING HERE IN THE US.

94
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,790
SO OVERALL I HOPE THEY DON'T
GIVE THOSE PEOPLE BACK, THAT

95
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,090
WOULD BE TERRIBLE.

96
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:40,889
THEY ESCAPE FROM THAT HORRIBLE
SITUATION IN NORTH KOREA.

97
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:44,290
I TOTALLY AGREE WITH ANNA.

98
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,460
NOTHING IS DONE UNTIL IT
IS DONE.

99
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,040
ESPECIALLY WITH DONALD TRUMP.

100
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,830
ANYTHING CAN GO WRONG AT ANY
MOMENT AND ALSO ESPECIALLY WITH

101
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,880
KIM JONG-UN.

102
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,770
THESE ARE PROBABLY
THE TWO MOST VOLATILE FOREIGN

103
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:04,150
LEADERS ñ NATIONAL LEADERS
THERE ARE IN THE WORLD.

104
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,270
DON'T COUNT YOUR CHICKENS BEFORE
THEY HATCH BUT IF THEY DO,

105
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,270
GREAT.

106
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:12,870
I AM IN THE CAMP OF IF TRUMP OR
ANYONE I OPPOSED IS DOING

107
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,139
SOMETHING POSITIVE, WONDERFUL.

108
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:18,260
YOU DON'T HAVE TO OPPOSE THEM
FOR THE SAKE OF OPPOSING THEM.

109
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:27,960
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE
WHAT THEY HAVE.

110
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,729
WE DON'T WANT TO BE IRRATIONAL
LIKE THAT.

111
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:33,820
THERE IS PLENTY OF GREAT REASONS
TO OPPOSE DONALD TRUMP BUT IF HE

112
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,180
DOES SOMETHING POSITIVE,
AWESOME.

113
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,570
ABSOLUTELY.

114
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:44,770
ONE FINAL POINT, WE ARE DEALING
WITH VOLATILE LEADERS BUT MORE

115
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,050
PORTLY WE ARE DEALING WITH
PEOPLE WHO HAVE INCREDIBLY

116
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,300
THIN-SKINNED.

117
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,949
AND DONALD TRUMP REALLY STANDS
OUT WHEN IT COMES TO THAT

118
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:53,070
CHARACTERISTIC.

119
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:58,300
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS
POSSIBLE, BUT I FEEL LIKE IF

120
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,910
THERE IS EVEN A SMALL THING LOST
IN TRANSLATION OR IF KIM JONG-IL

121
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:05,270
AND IS SOMETHING SLIGHTLY
CRITICAL OF TRUMP THINGS CAN

122
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,110
CHANGE RAPIDLY.

123
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:12,050
HE NEEDS TO KEEP HIS COOL AND HE
NEEDS TO CONTINUE GETTING

124
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,710
FAVORABLE NEWS COVERAGE IN

125
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,540
REGARD TO TREATING THE SITUATION
LIKE A DIPLOMATIC PRESIDENT.

126
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,700
YES.

127
00:08:19,700 --> 00:00:00,000
I HOPE IT GOES THAT WAY AND I
HOPE THE TALKS DON'T UNRAVEL.
