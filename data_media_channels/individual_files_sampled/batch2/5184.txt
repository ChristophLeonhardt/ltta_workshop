after his security clearance was revoked by President Trump former CIA director John Brennan made his strongest statements yet about Trump campaign collusion with the Russian government and a New York Times op-ed piece John Brennan wrote mr. Trump's claims of no collusion are in a word hogwash the only questions that remain are whether the collusion took place constituted criminally liable conspiracy whether obstruction of justice occurred to cover up any collusion or conspiracy and how many members of Trump incorporated attempted to defraud the government by laundering and concealing the movement of money into their pockets a jury is about to deliberate bank and tax fraud charges against one of those people Paul Manafort mr. Trump's former campaign chairman and the campaign's former deputy chairman Rick Gates has pleaded guilty to financial fraud and lying to investigators john brennan revealed some of what he as CIA director and then FBI director james comey discussed about Russia's attack on the election during the presidential campaign in my many conversations with James Comey the FBI director in the summer of 2016 we talked about the potential for American citizens involved in partisan politics or not to be pawns in Russian hands we knew that Russian intelligence services would do all they could to achieve their objectives which the United States intelligence community publicly assessed a few short months later were to undermine public faith in the American democratic process harm the electability of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and show preference for mr. Trump once again president Trump's official written position was contradicted by President Trump himself this time in an interview with The Wall Street Journal a statement written for the President and read yesterday by the White House press secretary said any benefits that senior officials might glean from consultations with mr. Brennan are now outweighed by the risks posed by his erratic conduct and behavior mr. Brennan has recently leveraged his status as a former high ranking official with access to highly sensitive information to make a series of unfounded and outrageous allegations wild outbursts on the internet and television about this administration but then last night in an impromptu interview with The Wall Street Journal the press contradicted his written statement giving no indication whatsoever that he had actually read that statement written in his name The Wall Street Journal says the president revoking John Brennan's security clearance and publicly considering revoking other security clearances is based entirely on John Brennan's involvement in the beginnings of the investigation of the Russian attack on the American electoral process the president said quote I call it the rigged witch hunt it is a sham mr. Trump said in that interview and these people led it he added so I think it's something that had to be done John Brennan says that he believes the president's increasingly erratic behavior including the revocation of his security clearance is because special prosecutor our reporters investigation is closing in on the president's and people close to the president mr. Trump clearly has become more desperate to protect himself in those close to him which is why he made the politically motivated decision to revoke my security clearance in an attempt to scare into silence others who might dare to challenge him now more than ever it is critically important that the special counsel robert muller and his team of investigators be allowed to complete their work without interference from mr. Trump or anyone else so that all Americans can get the answers they so rightly deserve the list of people who the White House revealed yesterday might have their security clearances revoked by President Trump has been compared to President Richard Nixon's enemies list which was revealed during the Watergate investigation it was certainly alarming to discover that Richard Nixon had an enemies list but no one was even slightly surprised that Richard Nixon had an enemies list and everyone on Richard Nixon's enemies list wore that designation as a badge of honor for the rest of their lives and that seems to be the reaction so far from people on the Trump enemies list which the White House said yesterday includes former director of national security the National Security Agency Michael Hayden and former Director of National Intelligence James clapper who said they will continue to speak up against the policies of the President and someone who was not on the Trump enemies list probably is now retired Navy Admiral William McRaven who was in command of the 2011 Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden wrote an open letter to the president in the Washington Post today saying former CIA director John Brennan whose security clearance you revoked on Wednesday is one of the finest public servants I have ever known few Americans have done more to protect this country than John he is a man of unparalleled integrity whose honesty and character have never been in question except by those who don't know him therefore I would consider it an honor if you would revoke my security clearance as well so I can add my name to the list of men and women who have spoken up against your presidency joining us now mica o yang former staff director for the House Intelligence Committee and vice president of the national security program at the Third Way also with us Ron Klain former chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden and Al Gore and the former senior aide to President Obama and Stuart Stevens is with us he's a Republican politican sultan tanned chief strategist for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign and make I am so struck by what is now turning into an honor roll and here we have the first step forward saying please revoke my security clearance - yeah it's what you're seeing is the national security community really up in arms about what's happening here in defense of John Brennan because the reason that he Brennan is so alarmed about what the president is doing and is continuing to do is what he saw when he was the director of the CIA the kind of information that he knows about the Russians attempts to get into the Trump campaign and to sway the 2016 election they're concerned that when you attack someone who is so loyally served the nation for raising alarms about hostile foreign powers interference in our political process that you are really undermining the basic foundations of democracy Ron Klain we are getting what is actually I think the usual spin from the White House whenever the president has done something truly kind of ugly there's always that report coming from inside the White House that the president is thrilled with how ugly it is and he wants to do more of it this of course does not mean that the report is true or that he's going to do more of it but here's what the Washington Post is reporting tonight president Trump has told advisors that he is eager to strip more security clearances as part of an escalating attack against people who have criticized him or played a role in the investigation of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign - White House officials said and so Ron Klain there could be more there could be more there will be more I think we're seeing Donald Trump truly unhinged we're seeing him upset by the continuing disclosures from Omarosa the the trial of Paul Manafort the fact that Bob mower is getting closer and closer to his conclusions but I think today he bit off more than he could chew when you have some like Admiral McRaven who is unassailable and his character and his commitment to our country step forward and say if you're going after John Brennan you have to go after me too and in Lawrence at the end of the day we're back to where these people were on May 1st 2011 when Admiral McRaven was leading the effort to kill Osama bin Laden John Brennan was overseeing it from the Situation Room and Donald Trump was hosting an episode of Celebrity Apprentice you know and that's really the choice we have as to who we're gonna trust about making the right decisions for national security at this stage in the game and Stuart Stevens Washington Post is reporting that the White House White House aides have confirmed that Trump made his decision weeks ago on Brennan they didn't have to confirm that because we saw the document yesterday dated July 26 that's how incompetent they are in this White House they couldn't even put that day's date on it and so we know they've been sitting there with this waiting for the day when they needed it and apparently the president decided Omarosa was getting the kind of attention that meant they needed to trade news subjects from Omarosa - John Brennan well the whole idea of Omarosa doing having any impact on what happens to the national security apparatus the United States is chilling but let's remember Steve ban and got five before Omarosa did in the White House and Steve Bannon had top-secret security and was on the National Security Council for a while and Steve Bannon is just a flat-out freak it's really just a shame to have this sort of political people have really worked to protect the country and I think Republicans you speak out more on it if you're gonna have a process of reviewing whether or not X officials should have security clearance there's an organized methodical way to do it the way that this looks it just looks patty and it looks vindictive sort of like another feud with Rosie O'Donnell and mica we NBC News is reporting that Director of National Intelligence dan coates was not informed beforehand about this revoking the security clearance had no idea the NBC News reports as an official familiar with the decision confirmed to NBC News that the Director of National Intelligence Dan coats was not informed before the announcement yeah that's very unusual that we would have the intelligence community who actually are the ones who would most likely to seek to benefit from director Brennan's experience if they need to call on him not really being part of this car dan coates literally could have been on the phone that morning with John Brennan about some previous business that had occurred during John Brennan's time and not known that the security clearance is being revoked that's right it's really surprising that this is not a decision that's coordinated through the other agencies because there may be important things that he's working on that are classified that he can't talk about now he said he hasn't had access to classified but when you have an ongoing crisis many of the things that he worked on may be relevant and you might want to the device later on and Ron Klain in John Brennan's op-ed piece today and pasa and I can't wait for his interview tomorrow night with Rachel he seems to take another step forward in in his statements about the president this time saying of course there was collusion we saw it we and we saw the president do it publicly by asking Russians for help and the question is now just a legal one Robert Louis question is does the collusion that John Brennan knows about and that surely and special prosecutor is looking at does that collusion meet the technical legal definition of conspiracy and violations of law that's right Lawrence I mean I think this is a very important point that former CIA director Brennan makes in his piece today the collusion between Trump and Russia really has been hiding in plain sight since the campaign since the obviously the meeting at Trump Tower the president standing up and saying hey Russia if you're listening please find her emails the evidence we now know that that very day the Russians went out and tried to probe for Hillary Clinton's emails there are ample evidence of collusion now that's that's a that's an important conclusion for our country about the Trump presidency it's a separate question without that was a crime and that's what Bob Moeller has to make an initial finding on report to Congress potentially about impeachment report to courts potentially about criminal charges that's a separate question but I think it's I think it's very fitting that director Brennan step forward today and really put a fine point on the fact that the idea what Donald Trump stands up there says no collusion no collusion no way not right not true there was collusion and Stewart I want to go back to your point about basically what we saw happen in the news a trading Omarosa for John Brennan and I spoke to someone right after this happened who's known gone from for many years worked with him in show business knows his moves and said I said to me he's a day trader he's just trading one story for the other he's just you know that's the way he plays this well we're living in a strange world where you can turn on cable news and hear recordings from the Situation Room but John Brennan's considered a threat we have to take away its national security Clarence I mean it just it just doesn't parse and the problem with this stuff is that as you were saying what you would think would happen behind doors just happens in plain sight and we know that there was cooperation with the Russians know what's the difference trained cooperation and collusion I'd leave that to lawyers but if somebody who worked on five presidential races the idea that you would talk to Russians about how to help your campaign it's just mind-boggling Stewart Donald Trump said every campaign would do it it's just not true I mean rods worked on a lot of campaigns you just you just wouldn't do it I mean for heaven's sakes the gore campaign got a debate book that was sent to him and the first thing they did was call the FBI and the debate book didn't come from the Russians it's just an absolute misunderstanding of how people really care about standards that are involved in this process you sure you want your person to win but it doesn't mean you want to cheat and you want to help get help from the Russians
