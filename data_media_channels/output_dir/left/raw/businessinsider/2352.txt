it seemed to match made in heaven or<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,470
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> week we got news from</font>

3
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,600
TechCrunch that Google was about to buy

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,539
Yelp for 550 million dollars but<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the</font>

5
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,699
end of the weekend Nicholas things had

6
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,250
soured in the relationship the talks had

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,650
collapsed by early<font color="#E5E5E5"> Monday morning the</font>

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,630
yelp camp was saying well it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yelp</font>

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,460
decision we've got bigger and<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,800
suitors we've got IPOs what really

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,500
happened here well<font color="#E5E5E5"> that depends</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">eyes both parties are spinning away</font>

13
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,219
sources close to Google say hey right

14
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:45,750
when this TechCrunch story came out

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,700
that's when Yelp came back and said oh

16
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,680
we have a third party we have something

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,140
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on that that's the reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,550
know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> really need a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font>

19
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,739
money and then so and so these sources

20
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,260
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google these Google sources are</font>

21
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,530
saying this leak is you we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> outta here</font>

22
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're done with this talk who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> refused to</font>

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,739
negotiate through the rest these<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

24
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,390
supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be confidential negotiations</font>

25
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,270
now what is the implication that there's

26
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,890
another deal here that the two parties

27
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,830
actually had a deal that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yelp went back</font>

28
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">on is that the implication or they were</font>

29
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,549
they just very close it sounds like<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

30
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:20,250
were at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> very close down to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

31
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">hundred and fifty million dollars plus</font>

32
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,970
earn outs no<font color="#CCCCCC"> one disputes that figure</font>

33
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,830
that's that's the deal that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was had and</font>

34
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,220
then you know this mysterious thing that

35
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,570
happened to Yelp that happened to

36
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,700
coincide the TechCrunch story you know

37
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,100
we don't we don't know it could be you

38
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,329
know people are saying oh could be

39
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,369
Microsoft it could be that they had a

40
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:40,560
long dark night of the soul and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jeremy</font>

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,780
Stoppelman CEO of yelp said you know we

42
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">really should IPO or investors pushed</font>

43
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,259
him you know that's that's that's sort

44
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,939
of the yelp argument here and that's

45
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,500
certainly possible maybe they just said

46
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,360
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what let's just we'll roll the</font>

47
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">dice and one of two things will happen</font>

48
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,000
either we will spook<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google into raising</font>

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,619
the number in which case we'll make a

50
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple hundred million dollars that way</font>

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,579
or if the talks collapse because Google

52
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,290
is angry<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll go public will make that</font>

53
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,060
much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it may yet work out for</font>

54
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,669
Yelp on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hand it may be that</font>

55
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,160
they have spectacularly blown the deal

56
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,090
here and Mike

57
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,739
question is whether they overplayed

58
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:15,239
their hand whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact it was</font>

59
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,129
sitting right there 550 million dollars

60
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:18,900
nothing to sneeze at maybe not an

61
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,780
absolute top dollar we're pretty good

62
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,090
got greedy went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> TechCrunch see if</font>

63
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,349
they could<font color="#CCCCCC"> jack it up and then suddenly</font>

64
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:27,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google reacts very harshly which by the</font>

65
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">way an important precedent for Google</font>

66
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,379
because Google is making behind a lot of

67
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,180
companies over the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years they</font>

68
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,620
can get the president out there that if

69
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,390
you try to screw with us in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the press</font>

70
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,489
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> walking away people will pay</font>

71
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:39,870
attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that so there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is an</font>

72
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,239
important precedent here so that seems

73
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,519
like a possibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> to object lesson just</font>

74
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:46,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't do this startups that's right to</font>

75
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,239
the next startup buying one a week you

76
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">know they need to set this I think</font>

77
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's a nigga can't it be emphasized</font>

78
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:54,780
enough they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want every little</font>

79
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,519
startup going to TechCrunch and getting

80
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,260
jacking it up a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's write</font>

81
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,000
which is a common tactic the acquirer

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,220
going going<font color="#CCCCCC"> gone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come on anybody else</font>

83
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,340
interested and so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will definitely be</font>

84
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,260
interested stress it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> over right</font>

85
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,030
this may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the little fight before the</font>

86
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,709
wedding right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now do you really want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:12,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">get married are you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to storm out</font>

88
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,099
at the all topic is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ring yes they</font>

89
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,680
could all be<font color="#CCCCCC"> friends by next week but</font>

90
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,239
certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> entertaining for a slow</font>

91
00:03:18,239 --> 00:00:00,000
holiday period it's pretty fun
