1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,056
"We don't really believe there
is a functional conservative

3
00:00:03,056 --> 00:00:04,680
party in this country,
and we certainly

4
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,720
don't think the
Republican Party is that."

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,990
Steve Bannon, a founding
member of Breitbart News,

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,320
a site that he has called a
platform for the alt-right,

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,840
has been a lightning rod for
critics of President Trump

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,110
since he joined the
campaign in August 2016.

9
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,860
"It's a stunning thing that
a white supremacist, Bannon,

10
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,800
would be a permanent member of
the National Security Council."

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,900
During his time in the
Trump administration,

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,337
Bannon's status has
ebbed and flowed.

13
00:00:30,337 --> 00:00:31,920
He's been seen as
the president's link

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,940
to his populist base.

15
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,000


16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,720
But Ivanka Trump and Jared
Kushner are critics of him.

17
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,630
Gen. John F. Kelly,
Trump's new chief of staff,

18
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,610
has also reportedly
raised concerns

19
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,110
about working with Bannon.

20
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,330
This past weekend,
Anthony Scaramucci,

21
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,060
the president's communications
director for a fleeting 10

22
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,780
days, called him out on
TV as sympathetic to white

23
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,392
nationalism.

24
00:00:55,392 --> 00:00:57,600
"I've never sat down with
Steve Bannon and said, hey,

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,850
are you a white nationalist
or a white supremacist?

26
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,330
But I think the toleration
of it by Steve Bannon

27
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,769
is inexcusable."

28
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,620
And H.R. McMaster, President
Trump's national security

29
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,785
adviser, has deflected
questions about Bannon.

30
00:01:09,785 --> 00:01:11,660
"Can you and Steve Bannon
still work together

31
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,930
in this White House or not?"

32
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,540
"Hey, I get to work
together with a broad range

33
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,640
of talented people."

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,100
"You didn't answer.

35
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,433
Can you and Steve Bannon work
in that same White House?"

36
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:22,860
"I am -- I am ready to work with
anybody who will help advance

37
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,350
the president's agenda."

38
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,460
"Do you believe Steve
Bannon does that?"

39
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,610
"I believe that everyone who
works in the White House, who

40
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,040
has the privilege, the
great privilege every day,

41
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,580
of serving their nation should
be motivated by that goal."

42
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,370
Trump may also be
souring on Bannon.

43
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,840
The president has
been frustrated

44
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,690
with his chief strategist
since a Time magazine cover

45
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,360
story called Bannon the
second-most powerful man

46
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,480
in the world.

47
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,420
"You will not replace us!"

48
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,380
The question now in the wake
of Charlottesville is whether

49
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,650
Bannon, often criticized as
emblematic of the far-right

50
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,410
nationalism that turned
violent in Virginia,

51
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,870
can salvage a role in
the administration --

52
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,710
or if he even wants to.

53
00:02:03,710 --> 00:00:00,000
