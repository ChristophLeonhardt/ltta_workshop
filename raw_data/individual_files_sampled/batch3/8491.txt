WEAPONS OF INTELLIGENCE AGAINST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, LIKE WE'VE BEEN EXPOSING ON THIS PROGRAM. JOINING US NOW, NRA TV COUNTRY PETER DAN BONGINO. DANIEL HOFFMAN. DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA. WE WILL START WITH YOU. DANIEL HOFFMAN. I INTERVIEWED JOSE RODRIGUEZ, HE WAS THERE. I DON'T LIKE HEARING THE TAPE ANYMORE BECAUSE I AIRED AT THE LAST TWO NIGHTS MY LOOK SKINNIER. HE WAS THERE, THE INFORMATION THAT LED TO THE COURIER THAT LED TO BIN LADEN CAME FROM THAT ENHANCED INTERROGATION. WE WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN BIN LADEN WITHOUT THOSE TECHNIQUES WHICH WERE MEDICALLY SUPERVISED AT THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF SAFETY, ALTHOUGH THEY DIDN'T KNOW IT. WRIGHT, SEAN. THERE'S A COUPLE POINTS HERE I WOULD HIGHLIGHT. FIRST OF ALL, IT'S AN UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH FOR THOSE WHO DIDN'T SUPPORT THE PROGRAM AND DON'T TODAY. THAT YES, IT ACTUALLY DID WORK. YOU CAN DEBATE THE MORALS AND ETHICS OF THE PROGRAM BUT IT DID WORK. WE DID OBTAIN SIGNIFICANCE INTELLIGENCE NOT JUST ON FINDING BIN LADEN BUT OTHER AL QAEDA OPERATIVES AS WELL AS WE STOP THREATS AGAINST OUR NATION. COULD YOU IMAGINE IF WE HAD THESE TECHNIQUES AND THEY WERE APPROVED AND WE HAD SOMEONE IN DETENTION WHO KNEW ABOUT A THREAT AND AN ATTACK TOOK PLACE ON AFTERWARDS, POSTMORTEM, WE WERE ASKED IF WE DID ALL WE COULD AND USED ALL OF OUR CAPABILITIES AND WE REPLY THAT WE DID NOT. I THINK THOSE SAME CONGRESSMEN WHO ARE GRILLING GINA HASPEL WOULD HAVE CONFRONTED US OVER DERELICTION OF DUTY. Sean: LET ME GO TO DR. GORKA. DR. GORKA, THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING THE COUNTRY AND LOOK, IT WAS THE LOT THE TIME. ALSO IT WAS UNDER THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF MEDICAL SUPERVISION. WE ARE NOT, SOME OF THESE DEMOCRATIC SENATORS SUGGEST, WE ARE NOT THE ENEMY. NOW, THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE KNOWN IT WAS MEDICALLY SUPERVISED, BUT THEY DIDN'T NEED TO KNOW THAT. IN THE AFTERMATH OF 3,000 AMERICANS KILLED, WE NEEDED INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT ELSE MIGHT BE COMING, WHAT DANGERS EXIST, AND I THINK SHE AND OTHERS DID AMERICA A GREAT SERVICE HERE. THIS WOMAN IS A PATRIOT AND A 30-YEAR PLUS VETERAN OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. PERSONALLY, AND I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO THE DETAILS, I HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH ENHANCED INTERROGATION BECAUSE OF THE DANGER IT CAN LEAD TO A PEOPLE FABRICATING INFORMATION TO GET YOU TO STOP DOING WHAT YOU ARE DOING TO THEM. BUT LOOK AT THE FACTS. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THREE PEOPLE, SEAN. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT INTERROGATIONS THAT LED TO THE SAVING OF LIVES UNDOUBTEDLY. AND THE LAST POINT IS ONE OF HONOR. ALL OF THESE PEOPLE WERE FINE WITH THESE TECHNIQUES, AND ALL OF THESE PEOPLE WERE FINE WITH THIS WOMAN WHEN SHE WAS ACTING DIRECTOR I NEVER QUESTIONED HER INTEGRITY OR HER MORALS. AND THAT IS DESPICABLE THAT THESE COWARDS NOW ARE ATTACKING HER FOR EXACTLY THE THINGS THEY APPROVED OF AFTER 9/11. Sean: WELL SAID. DAN BONGINO, LET ME TURN TO OTHER TOPICS. PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOWED MILITARY FORCE AFTER MISSILES WERE FIRED OVER JAPAN AND THREATS TO GUAM AND EVEN THE CONTINENTAL U.S. PRESIDENT TRUMP PUT SANCTIONS ON NORTH KOREA. PRESIDENT TRUMP MOCKED THE NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR. THE MEDIA, THE DEMOCRATS SAID HE WOULD START A NUCLEAR WAR. WHAT IF WE HAD SO FAR? WE'VE HAD CONCESSIONS. THREE AMERICANS HOME SAFELY TODAY. WE NEVER THOUGHT WE WOULD SEE KIM JONG UN CROSS THE DMZ INTO THE ARMS OF THE SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT. WE SEE NOW THE POSSIBILITY OF THE DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA IN TOTAL. WE HAVE SEEN OTHER CONCESSIONS. THIS IS AN AMAZING TEACHABLE MOMENT FOR PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH, IS IT NOT? IT IS, BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL GET ZERO CREDIT BECAUSE THE, YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL. I GET REALLY UPSET, SEAN, BECAUSE THE THINK TANK PEOPLE AND THE SWAMP RATS, THE SLOBS WHO HAVE BEEN IN POWER FOREVER WHO FOLLOW THE STRUCTURED PATHS OF FORMAL DIPLOMACY. THEY HAVE HAD THEIR BOW TIES ON. THEY'VE HAD THEIR COCKTAIL LUNCHES. THEY ARE THE ONES LAUGHING AT TRUMP RIGHT NOW DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE'S GOT RESULTS THAT NONE OF THEM COULD GET. THEY THINK HE'S SOME KIND OF NEANDERTHAL CREEP. THEY FOLLOWED ALL THE FORMAL PATHS, PLAYED BY ALL THE RULES. YOU KNOW WHAT PROMPTED? HE CAME IN THERE. HE WASN'T USED TO THESE RULES. HE WAS A BUILDER FROM QUEENS AND HE SAID WAIT. LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT, THERE ARE STILL NUKES ON THE PENINSULA DESPITE THE SMART PEOPLE TELLING US HOW TO GET RID OF IT. HE WAS UNPREDICTABLE, AND HE'S THE ONE WHO GOT RESULTS, AND HE WON'T GET AN OUNCE OF CREDIT FOR IT AMONGST THAT CLASS. Sean: AS HE SAID, HE JUST WANTS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM WHICH BY THE WAY I REMEMBER WINSTON CHURCHILL SAID BLOOD, TOIL, TEARS, SWEAT, VICTORY. THAT'S OUR GOAL. THE PRESIDENT THEY SAID I WANT THE WORLD SAFER. WHICH BRINGS US TO THE ISRAELIS. DANIEL HOFFMAN, THEY HAD TO STRIKE BACK. YOU CANNOT ALLOW THE IRANIAN FORCES AND MULLAHS TO FIRE MISSILES FROM SYRIA BASES INTO ISRAEL AND NOT HAVE A MASSIVE PRICE TO PAY. THE VIEWERS WILL RECALL THAT NO MATTER WHAT THREAT, WHETHER IT'S AN IRAQI NUCLEAR PROGRAM IN THE 1980s OR A SYRIAN NUCLEAR PROGRAM WHICH ISRAEL DESTROYED IN 2007, THEY DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THE THREATS OFF THE TABLE. THEY HAVE IT EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITIES IN THIS CASE THE IRANIANS PRESENTED AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO THEM FROM SYRIA. FRANKLY, SEAN, EXPECT ISRAEL TO CONTINUE TO MOUNT THOSE SORTS OF OPERATIONS TO GET THERE IS A DISTANCE A. Sean: LET'S SAY A STEP FURTHER. I THINK THE PRESIDENT, WILL BY WITHDRAWING FROM THIS HORRIFIC $150 BILLION IDIOCY OF BARACK OBAMA, DR. GORKA, SHOWING THE WORLD AMERICA IS BACK. AMERICA'S LEADING OF THE WORLD STAGE. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT MESSAGE I THINK TO SEND THE WORLD, WHETHER OUR EUROPEAN ALLIES LIKE IT OR NOT, I FRANKLY DON'T CARE. THEY ARE GOING TO TOW THE LINE. THEY WILL MOAN AND MOAN BUT THEY WILL FOLLOW OUR LEAD BECAUSE WE ARE THE ONLY LEADERS OUT THERE. THAT'S HOW IT WORKS IN THE 20TH CENTURY AND THAT'S HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK UNDER DONALD TRUMP IN THE 21ST CENTURY. THAT'S POWER, POLITICS. THE BOTTOM LINE IS VERY SIMPLE.
