chief of a British military laboratory said it was unable to determine the precise source of the nerve agent used in the attack that casts doubt on earlier statements that blamed Russia directly we have not verified the precise source but we provided the scientific information to the government but you have not been able to establish a Porton Down that this was made in Russia as I said it's our job to provide you know their scientific evidence that identifies what the particular nerve agent is but it's not our job to NC where that actually was manufactured so to be clear you're not able at Porton down to say where it is from we haven't yet been able to do that but when I look at the evidence I mean the people from from Portland down they were absolutely categorical and I asked the guy myself I said are you sure and he said there's no doubt
