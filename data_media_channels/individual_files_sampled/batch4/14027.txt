can't we all just get along and if not can't we all share a chuckle over something every once in a while just a little bit every once in a while last week the internet united over a disagreement sounds contradictory I know but many people on the collective internet and social media Facebook Twitter Instagram all of that carried on a debate about whether an audio recording was saying the word Laurel or E Annie now how often do we get to engage in these light-hearted disagreements hardly ever right so why on earth do celebrities feel a need to completely meltdown over a video pertaining to that debate that we're all talking about but it's put out by the White House if you haven't seen the video I'm talking about it's on the White House's official Twitter but basically it's short little snippets of White House staffers giving their opinion on whether they think the video says Laurel or yawning it featured Ivanka Trump Rose Shah Mercedes slap vice president pence and a few others in the clip in what I found to be a very humorous and somewhat self-deprecating moment Kellyanne Conway says it's Laurel but I could deflect into Bertie Annie if you need me to so in true spokesperson style when the cameraman told press secretary Sarah Sanders that it was reported that she had heard Laurel she says clearly you're getting your information from CNN because that's fake news now I showed the video to a bleeding-heart liberal friend of mine Christina and she giggled throughout the entire video but what actually made her laugh out loud was at the end when President Trump is asked that question what he heard and he says I hear a cough Fe now it's it's funny and it provided a moment of levity in politics that I think a lot of people are truly thirsting for even people on the left but of course there are always those bad bananas that ruin the whole bunch and they seem to grow a lot of those sour bananas here in Hollywood reacting to the video actor Adam Scott tweeted white supremacists are bad at comedy director and social activist slash identity politics pusher Judd Apatow tweeted it's amazing how unfunny Republicans are I am offended at the attempt of course you are I won't tear any kids away from their parents and they shouldn't attempt humor I'm sorry what an Modern Family producer Danny Zuko tweeted do quit your day job and there of course were a few other celebrity tweets but they contained far too much foul language for me to even attempt to read so what's up Hollywood you guys can find humor in calling our president and a-hole a picture of the president beheaded is considered comedy to you but you won't allow yourself a tiny little chuckle over this it's like I've said all along they're so utterly consumed with their indoctrinated hate for this president that it no longer even occurs to them I really don't think it does it doesn't occur to them that they can hear or view something having to do with the White House and not be offended it's such a miserable existence I don't think I was even that miserable under President Obama and he almost destroyed the country maybe I should have been truthfully anyway did you watch the video did you find it funny if not were you offended by it let us know in the comments and most importantly obviously let us know did you hear Laurel or e any thanks so much for watching everybody I'm Amanda head for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebels subscribe to our premium content at www.hsn app for the rebel media on the app store that way you will have instant and easy access to all of our latest videos and your favorite rebel shows thanks so much for watching i'm amanda head for the rebel
