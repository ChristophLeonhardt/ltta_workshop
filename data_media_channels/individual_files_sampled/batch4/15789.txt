a Labour Party campaign has been launched calling for Kate Hoey Labour MP to run for Tory leadership Kate Hoey has been in trouble with the Labour Party and the new normal within the Labour Party for a while now ever since she share shared platforms with Nigel Faraj and other breaks or tears and talked about the benefits of brags it and now she's even facing deselection from her local Labour Party before the next general election because she dares to again stand up for break brexit and defend the decision made by the British people now the Labour Party hates her the the new normal in the labour party hates her and I'm talking about the anti-semites the far left the hardcore socialist communist types and I think it's symptomatic of the changes that have happened in the labour party over the last couple of decades I guess it started with social politics it started with the opening of the borders with Tony Blair in 1997 but since then it's progressed just from open borders to being some kind of new communist political party that's just moving further and further to the left the Labour Party was founded in 1900 me only took 24 years or so until it actually entered government now that's big I mean that so for a party to grow and develop and in 24 years be running the country it's quite amazing you couldn't achieve that but the Labour Party did back in 1900 and it grew so quickly because it was set up to represent the interests of the working people I mean Kate Hoey I'm no huge fan of I know she defends briggsie I don't think she really genuinely represents the views of the regular working people of Britain but she does so better than most politicians and she's part of a party that was founded in 1900 to represent the interests of the working people and for a long time the party did but now look at it a woman who dares to defend Briggs it has been attacked by her own party there's anti-semitism scandals every single week they've got a Home Secretary that doesn't like white people and can't count and a Shadow Chancellor who doesn't understand and economics it's astounding the the whole thing is a farce and of course they've got a leader who wants to keep the borders open and destroy the economy and civilized society which of course impacts working people the Labour Party's just a shadow over its former self now don't you think and that's evident when you look at the new campaign that's been set up calling for Kate Hoey who's always in trouble now they're calling for her to run for Tory leadership so Labor List writes about this and they wrote labor activists have launched a campaign urging breaks to tear rebel Kate Hoey to run for leader of the Conservative Party party members involved with the campaign point out that Hoey has gone against the Labour Party line on several issues from drags it to fox hunting and grammar schools the newly set up website Howey for leader sarcastically praises the Labour MPs brave leadership and loyalty to the Conservative Party whip the fro campaign comes on the back of a unanimous vote by Vauxhall Labour last month in favor of deselecting Harriers and Labour candidate the motion of censure called for the Labour went to be removed and for the Labour MP to be ruled ineligible for future selection is this the party your parents voted for is this the party that represents the interests of working people I don't think so the party seems completely unfit for purpose to me and I've always thought actually that if trading standards applied to politics as well as business then the Labour Party would be you know wide open for a legal case against them from misrepresentation of what they offer and who they are the Labour Party the clue is in the name they don't represent the interests of working people and actually the trading standard thing applies to the Tories as well because they call themselves the Conservative Party into this day I don't know why exactly they're conserving so by anyway they claim to represent the working-class the Labour Party is utter nonsense at this point because really they're standing up for the middle class elite aren't they they're standing up for they the London elite who don't like anything brags it who don't like people talking about closing the borders or at least managing the borders em sensibly and they don't want to maintain the culture and society that we know and love think of the people of Sunderland remember on the night of the brig's it referendum when Sunderland came in and suddenly all our prospects changed me what like we were going to win and we did think of those people in Sunderland those people in the north of systematically let down by the politicians over and over again all the while being represented by labor members of parliament and ask yourself do they really represent them catch up with all the rebel stories on our brand new app which you can download now from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store you
