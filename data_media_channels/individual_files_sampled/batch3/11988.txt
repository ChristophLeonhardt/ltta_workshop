high school marching bands performance in the US state of Mississippi has sparked anger a student's enacted holding policemen at gunpoint the pictures show members of Forest Hills band dressed up as doctors and nurses and armed with toy guns the performance was delivered during a high school football game officials meanwhile have slammed the show this is unacceptable in a civilized society someone should be held accountable why would any high school marching band ever need fake guns had they been performing this routine all year I was making a complaint in Mississippi High School Activities Association as well as the Forest Hill and GPS administration how could any administrator think that halftime show was appropriate last night Forest Hills band performed a halftime show at Brookhaven High School depicting police officers being held at gunpoint absolutely disgusting well the incident certainly struck a chord as it comes less than a week after two local officers were shot dead in the line of duty the head over Jackson public schools has issued an apology for the performance the band's performance does not depict the values and people in our community and was incredibly insensitive to the students families law enforcement officials and the entire Brookhaven community for this we sincerely apologize to all and we pledge to do better in the future so we got reaction to the students performance from former police officer Dominic ezal these are becoming more commonplace lately and I think it's I think it's an unfortunate kids are the easiest ones that play off their emotions today's youth is an army for the future to impact earn them with beliefs that just are inaccurate and we're forcing them we're indoctrinating them into being soldiers and to either conservative or liberal side and I think this is just the effect of false fed information and emotions that are pouring gasoline on emotions and letting them run wild with their imaginations for kids they're being brainwashed they're being fed into falsehoods all the incentive you need poison the youth can make the youth work for you I do want them to be more public countable you know with these police protests or violence I'm really torn about the issue because I want to be fair to everyone across the board and just because I didn't like something doesn't mean that it's not okay you
