7
00:00:14,816 --> 00:00:16,651
OFFICIALS SAY THERE ARE REPORTS

00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:19,954
THAT NEARLY 1500 KIDS ARE LOST

9
00:00:19,954 --> 00:00:21,756
BUT IT’S JUST NOT TRUE.

10
00:00:21,756 --> 00:00:24,392
ED HENRY LOOKS OUT THE FACTS

11
00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:24,759
TONIGHT.

00:00:29,798 --> 00:00:32,601
HATERS GOT TRIGGERED.

16
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:33,335
THEY RELEASED A TAX SAYING SHE

17
00:00:33,335 --> 00:00:36,872
NOT CARE ABOUT MIGRANT KIDS AND

18
00:00:36,872 --> 00:00:37,506
WANTED TO KNOW WHERE THE

19
00:00:37,506 --> 00:00:41,109
CHILDREN WERE.

20
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:43,045
OVER 1400 MIGRANT CHILDREN HAVE

21
00:00:43,045 --> 00:00:44,646
GONE MISSING AND BLAMED

22
00:00:44,646 --> 00:00:45,347
PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR ORDERING

23
00:00:45,347 --> 00:00:47,449
BABIES TO BE SEPARATED FROM

24
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:50,285
THEIR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT PARENTS.

25

SERVICES FIRED BACK TODAY.

29
00:00:57,392 --> 00:00:58,427
NONE OF THOSE CHARGES ARE TRUE.

30
00:00:58,427 --> 00:01:01,563
>> THAT IS IN INACCURATE

31
00:01:01,563 --> 00:01:02,031
CHARACTERIZATION

32
00:01:02,031 --> 00:01:04,333
CHARACTERIZATION OF WHAT

33
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:04,700
HAPPENED.

34
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,669
THE GOVERNMENT WILL TRY TO

35
00:01:06,669 --> 00:01:07,369
PROSECUTE EVERYONE WHO CROSSES

36
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:10,172
THE SOUTHWEST BORDER ILLEGALLY.

37
00:01:10,172 --> 00:01:11,740
EVEN THOSE SEEKING ASYLUM.

38
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,209
THAT WILL LEAD TO SOME PARENTS

39
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:14,610
BEING SEPARATED FROM THEIR

40
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,045
CHILDREN, WHICH IS ALREADY PART

41
00:01:16,045 --> 00:01:17,646
OF EXISTING LAW.

42
00:01:17,646 --> 00:01:21,584
>> IF YOU ARE SMUGGLING A CHILD,

43
00:01:21,584 --> 00:01:23,386
THEN WE WILL PROSECUTE YOU.

44
00:01:23,386 --> 00:01:26,489
AND THAT CHILD MAY BE SEPARATED

45
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:28,858
FROM YOU AS REQUIRED BY LAW.

46
00:01:28,858 --> 00:01:31,894
>> THE 1475 KIDS WHO ALLEGEDLY

47
00:01:31,894 --> 00:01:33,563

BORDER FROM OCTOBER THROUGH

49
00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:39,569
DECEMBER 2017, MONTHS BEFORE THE

50
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:40,937
SESSION’S POLICY WENT INTO

51
00:01:40,937 --> 00:01:42,605
EFFECT.

52
00:01:42,605 --> 00:01:44,040
SECONDLY HHS OFFICIALS POINTED

53
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,010
OUT THAT THOSE KIDS WERE A TOTAL

54
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,511
OF CHILDREN THAT THEY SURVEYED

55
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:49,145
OVER THOSE THREE MONTHS WE

56
00:01:49,145 --> 00:01:53,216
SHOWED AT THE BORDER WITHOUT

57
00:01:53,216 --> 00:01:54,951
PARENTS.

58
00:01:54,951 --> 00:01:56,319
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS

59
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,355
TOOK THE EXTRA STEP OF PLACING

60
00:01:59,355 --> 00:02:01,391
OVER 7,000 KIDS WITH THE ADULT

61
00:02:01,391 --> 00:02:02,959
SPONSORS IN THE U.S.

62
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,527
HHS FOUND 6,500 OF THE KIDS

63
00:02:04,527 --> 00:02:09,566
STILL LIVING WITH SPONSORS.

64
00:02:09,566 --> 00:02:14,371
FIVE WERE DEPORTED, AND HHS

65
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:16,039
OFFICIALS SAY SOME OF THEIR

66
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:19,042
SPONSORS ARE HERE ILLEGALLY,

67
00:02:19,042 --> 00:02:20,343
LIKELY DODGING THE GOVERNMENT’S

68
00:02:20,343 --> 00:02:24,481
ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT THEM.

69
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:25,515
ERIC HARTIGAN SAID" THE

70
00:02:25,515 --> 00:02:29,152
ASSERTION THAT UNACCOMPANIED

71
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:30,654
CHILDREN ARE LOST IS FALSE.

72
00:02:30,654 --> 00:02:34,558
THIS IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF THE

73
00:02:34,558 --> 00:02:38,128
A DODGE, NO GOOD DEED GOES

74
00:02:38,128 --> 00:02:38,529
UNPUNISHED.

THAT INCLUDED JOURNALIST FROM

76
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:43,967
COMPOUNDING THE

77
00:02:43,967 --> 00:02:45,769
MISCHARACTERIZATIONS.

78
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:47,538
INCLUDING THIS PHOTO FROM

79

AZCENTRAL.COM.

80
00:02:48,138 --> 00:02:48,739
IT WAS A PHOTO OF LATINO

81
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:54,612
CHILDREN BEING HELD IN CAGES.

82
00:02:54,612 --> 00:02:57,415
THE PROBLEM WAS THAT IMAGE WAS

83
00:02:57,415 --> 00:03:00,051
TAKEN IN 2014 WHEN BARACK OBAMA

84
00:03:00,051 --> 00:03:00,484
WAS PRESIDENT.

85
00:03:00,484 --> 00:03:04,188
