ONE IS A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION POLICY THAT WENT UNNOTICED.

30

POLICY THAT WENT UNNOTICED. IN JUNE THEY STARTED ASKING

IT TAKES LONGER FOR THE PARENTS TO GET THE COURAGE TO COME

43
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:06,767
TO GET THE COURAGE TO COME FORWARD, AND IT TAKES DAYS

WITH THE POLICIES PUT IN PLACE BY PRIOR ADMINISTRATIONS WHO

DONE? THAT’S THE ARGUMENT WE HEAR FROM

00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:38,933
THAT’S THE ARGUMENT WE HEAR FROM TEAM TRUMP.

00:01:38,967 --> 00:01:40,334
TEAM TRUMP. >> THE ARGUMENT THEY’RE GOING TO

69
00:01:40,335 --> 00:01:41,869
>> THE ARGUMENT THEY’RE GOING TO MAKE HERE IS THEY WANT TO MAKE

70
00:01:41,903 --> 00:01:43,003
MAKE HERE IS THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THESE CHILDREN GO TO

71
00:01:43,004 --> 00:01:43,938
SURE THESE CHILDREN GO TO PARENTS WHO ARE THEIR PARENTS

72
00:01:43,972 --> 00:01:45,239
PARENTS WHO ARE THEIR PARENTS AND THEY’RE GOING TO SAFE HOMES.

73
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,340

THIS LAWSUIT WHEN THEY WERE FIGHTING ABOUT WHO TO REUNITE

76
00:01:49,244 --> 00:01:50,711
FIGHTING ABOUT WHO TO REUNITE WAS THAT THEY KEPT KIND OF

77
00:01:50,712 --> 00:01:52,746
WAS THAT THEY KEPT KIND OF PUTTING A STANDARD ON BIOLOGICAL

00:01:52,748 --> 00:01:54,048
PUTTING A STANDARD ON BIOLOGICAL PARENTS THAT YOU WOULD PUT ON

SOMEONE APPLYING TO ADOPT A CHILD, WHEREAS YOU SHOULD HAVE A

CHILD, WHEREAS YOU SHOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT STANDARD.

82
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,721
DIFFERENT STANDARD. YOU SHOULDN’T HAVE TO PROVE

YOU SHOULDN’T HAVE TO PROVE YOU’VE NEVER HAD A DUI.

84
00:02:01,423 --> 00:02:02,823
YOU’VE NEVER HAD A DUI. THERE ARE PLENTY OF PARENTS WHO
