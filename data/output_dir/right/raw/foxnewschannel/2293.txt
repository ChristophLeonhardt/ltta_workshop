1
00:00:00,364 --> 00:00:03,334
ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT
EVERYDAY VERZENIO.

2
00:00:11,575 --> 00:00:13,477
HOWIE: THE INTENSE FOCUS ON

3
00:00:13,477 --> 00:00:16,547
DONALD TRUMP'S WAR WITH THE

4
00:00:16,547 --> 00:00:18,316
MEDIA, HILLARY CLINTON HAD SOME

5
00:00:18,316 --> 00:00:20,651
TENSE REWHRAITIONS HER PRESS

6
00:00:20,651 --> 00:00:21,952
CORPS.

7
00:00:21,952 --> 00:00:23,754
ONE REPORTER SAID SHE REALLY

8
00:00:23,754 --> 00:00:24,955
HATES ME.

9
00:00:24,955 --> 00:00:28,492
JOINING ME, AMY CHOZICK, THE

10
00:00:28,492 --> 00:00:31,495
AUTHOR OF THE BOOK "CHASING

11
00:00:31,495 --> 00:00:31,862
HILLARY."

12
00:00:31,862 --> 00:00:35,466
YOU WROTE IN THE BACK IT FELT

13
00:00:35,466 --> 00:00:37,702
DAMN GOOD TO BASS NEXT GIRL

14
00:00:37,702 --> 00:00:40,137
POWER WHEN SHE GOT THE

15
00:00:40,137 --> 00:00:40,771
NOMINATION.

16
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:43,407
THEN YOU SAY WHEN YOU WROTE YOUR

17
00:00:43,407 --> 00:00:45,643
LAST STORY AFTER THE ELECTION,

18
00:00:45,643 --> 00:00:46,544
YOU FINALLY CRIED.

19
00:00:46,544 --> 00:00:49,714
DID YOU FEEL COMPROMISED AS A

20
00:00:49,714 --> 00:00:52,016
REPORTER COVERING THIS CANDIDATE

21
00:00:52,016 --> 00:00:54,185
WHO YOU PASSIONATELY BELIEVED

22
00:00:54,185 --> 00:00:54,452
IN.

23
00:00:54,452 --> 00:00:58,389
>> I CRIED BECAUSE I WAS

24
00:00:58,389 --> 00:00:58,989
ABSOLUTELY EXHAUSTED.

25
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:00,591
I MAKE CLEAR IT'S NOT BECAUSE

26
00:01:00,591 --> 00:01:01,325
HILLARY LOST.

27
00:01:01,325 --> 00:01:03,194
IF YOU READ THE BOOK YOU KNOW

28
00:01:03,194 --> 00:01:07,932
THERE WAS AN INCREDIBLY

29
00:01:07,932 --> 00:01:08,866
CONTENTIOUS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

30
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:10,134
HILLARY CLINTON AND THE PRESS

31
00:01:10,134 --> 00:01:12,336
AND MY POSITION AS THE LEAD BEAT

32
00:01:12,336 --> 00:01:13,170
REPORTER.

33
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,039
SHE CALLED THE POLITICAL PRESS

34
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:17,108
BIG EGOS AND NO BRAINS.

35
00:01:17,108 --> 00:01:19,076
I THINK THAT TENSION CARRIED

36
00:01:19,076 --> 00:01:21,846
OVER AND SPILLED OVER INTO THAT

37
00:01:21,846 --> 00:01:23,814
U.N. PRESS CONFERENCE WHERE SHE

38
00:01:23,814 --> 00:01:27,685
HAD TO ADDRESS THE PRIVATE EMAIL

39
00:01:27,685 --> 00:01:29,520
SERVER FOR THE FIRST TIME.

40
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,123
HOWIE: YOU SAY THE EMAIL SCANDAL

41
00:01:32,123 --> 00:01:33,958
BROKEN BY THE "NEW YORK TIMES,"

42
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:36,260
YOU THOUGHT IT HAD NO MORE

43
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:40,431
NATIONAL IMPORTANCE THAN BRISTOL

44
00:01:40,431 --> 00:01:41,766
PALIN'S PREGNANCY.

45
00:01:41,766 --> 00:01:44,602
BUT YOU SAID I WOULD REGRET AND

46
00:01:44,602 --> 00:01:46,404
RESENT IT BECAME THE ONLY STORY.

47
00:01:46,404 --> 00:01:51,041
>> I DIDN'T COMPARE IT TO

48
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:53,611
BRISTOL PALIN'S PREGNANCY.

49
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:56,247
THIS IS NOT SPECIFIC TO THE "NEW

50
00:01:56,247 --> 00:01:57,114
YORK TIMES."

51
00:01:57,114 --> 00:01:59,917
THE EMAIL SERVER PAYMENT ONLY

52
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:02,720
STORY, AND I THINK THERE WERE

53
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,588
PLENTY OTHER THINGS THE PUBLIC

54
00:02:04,588 --> 00:02:07,324
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT HILLARY

55
00:02:07,324 --> 00:02:10,060
CLINTON.

56
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,029
POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE IT'S JUST

57
00:02:12,029 --> 00:02:14,432
THE FACT THERE WERE PROBABLY

58
00:02:14,432 --> 00:02:19,170
OTHER THINGS.

59
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,840
HOWIE: SINCE THE BOOK CAME OUT,

60
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,642
CHELSEA CLINTON SAYS YOU GOT A

61
00:02:24,642 --> 00:02:26,577
FEW THINGS WRONG INCLUDING SHE

62
00:02:26,577 --> 00:02:29,847
WAS POPPING THE CHAMPAGNE CORK

63
00:02:29,847 --> 00:02:32,149
ON ELECTION NIGHT WHEN SHE SAYS

64
00:02:32,149 --> 00:02:36,654
SHE WAS HOME WITH HER BABY.

65
00:02:36,654 --> 00:02:37,455
>> I IDENTIFY WITH CHELSEA SINCE

66
00:02:37,455 --> 00:02:39,924
I HAVE MY 8-WEEK-OLD BABY AT

67
00:02:39,924 --> 00:02:40,791
HOME RIGHT NOW.

68
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,760
THEY WERE ATTACKING THE BOOK

69
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,929
BEFORE IT EVEN CAME OUT.

70
00:02:44,929 --> 00:02:47,865
AND I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR

71
00:02:47,865 --> 00:02:48,365
CHELSEA.

72
00:02:48,365 --> 00:02:50,801
I COVERED THIS FAMILY FOR A

73
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:51,902
DECADE.

74
00:02:51,902 --> 00:02:54,872
I KEPT COPIOUS NOTES.

75
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:57,107
SO I THINK, YOU KNOW, SOME OF

76
00:02:57,107 --> 00:02:59,276
THE FIGHTING OVER CHAMPAGNE AND

77
00:02:59,276 --> 00:03:01,612
HAIR TREATMENT SPEAKS TO THE

78
00:03:01,612 --> 00:03:06,884
BROADER THEMES OF THE BOOK.

79
00:03:06,884 --> 00:03:12,590
HOWIE: YOU WRITE THAT HILLARY

80
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:17,294
CLINTON'S MALE COTERIE OF MOSTLY

81
00:03:17,294 --> 00:03:18,429
MALE AIDES.

82
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:20,698
BUT WHY DIDN'T YOU NAME THEM IN

83
00:03:20,698 --> 00:03:21,432
THE BOOK.

84
00:03:21,432 --> 00:03:23,934
YOU GIVE THEM NICKNAMES.

85
00:03:23,934 --> 00:03:25,870
IT'S LIKE YOU ARE PROTECTING

86
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,170
THEM.

87
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,739
>> I DIDN'T GIVE THESE GUYS

88
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:31,008
NICKNAMES BECAUSE I WAS

89
00:03:31,008 --> 00:03:33,677
PROTECTING THEIR ANONYMITY.

90
00:03:33,677 --> 00:03:35,613
YOU MADE A CONNECTION THAT YOU

91
00:03:35,613 --> 00:03:37,915
THINK ONE OF THEM IS HILLARY'S

92
00:03:37,915 --> 00:03:38,782
YOU AIDE.

93
00:03:38,782 --> 00:03:42,052
HOWIE: I KNOW WHO IT IS BECAUSE

94
00:03:42,052 --> 00:03:44,455
SAID HE PLAYED INTO THE BASE.

95
00:03:44,455 --> 00:03:48,225
>> THIS WASN'T ABOUT GRANTING

96
00:03:48,225 --> 00:03:48,692
ANONYMITY.

97
00:03:48,692 --> 00:03:51,962
MY MOM'S BOOK CLUB IN TEXAS.

98
00:03:51,962 --> 00:03:53,998
THESE GUYS ALL HAVE SIMILAR

99
00:03:53,998 --> 00:03:55,165
DESCRIPTIONS.

100
00:03:55,165 --> 00:03:57,668
THEY ALL PLAYED THE SAME ROLE IN

101
00:03:57,668 --> 00:03:59,503
MY LIFE, CONTROLLING COVERAGE

102
00:03:59,503 --> 00:04:02,506
AND TRYING TO GET IN MY HEAD.

103
00:04:02,506 --> 00:04:06,110
THEY BECAME A TRAGIC GREEK

104
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:06,844
CHORUS.

105
00:04:06,844 --> 00:04:09,079
I THOUGHT IT WOULD RESONATE WITH

106
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:14,351
READERS TO GIVE THEM MONIKERS.

107
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:15,286
HOWIE: I ADOPTED HILLARY'S MOOD,

108
00:04:15,286 --> 00:04:17,555
I WENT AROUND THE WORLD DECEMBER

109
00:04:17,555 --> 00:04:21,392
UPON ACCIDENT AND AGGRIEVED FOR

110
00:04:21,392 --> 00:04:24,161
NOT BEING LIKEABLE ENOUGH.

111
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:25,596
DOESN'T SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

112
00:04:25,596 --> 00:04:31,168
>> THERE IS AN INSTINCT AS A

113
00:04:31,168 --> 00:04:32,369
FEMALE TO BE LIKEABLE.

114
00:04:32,369 --> 00:04:34,638
IF YOU PICK UP THE MOOD OF THE

115
00:04:34,638 --> 00:04:36,840
CAMPAIGN, THAT WAS A

116
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,809
PARTICULARLY JOYLESS PERIOD IN

117
00:04:38,809 --> 00:04:40,344
HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN.

118
00:04:40,344 --> 00:04:41,745
WHEN YOU ARE TRAVELING

119
00:04:41,745 --> 00:04:43,514
EVERYWHERE SHE IS AND GOING TO

120
00:04:43,514 --> 00:04:47,184
THESE RALLIES YOU CAN'T HELP BUT

121
00:04:47,184 --> 00:04:49,153
ADOPT THAT BUS.

122
00:04:49,153 --> 00:04:51,689
MY COLLEAGUES ON THE BERNIE BUS

123
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:55,993
WERE EXUDING THE CONFIDENCE OF A

124
00:04:55,993 --> 00:04:57,261
BUGGED INSURGENCY.

125
00:04:57,261 --> 00:04:59,563
HOWIE: YOU WERE ON THIS PROGRAM

126
00:04:59,563 --> 00:05:01,532
FOUR YEARS AGO.

127
00:05:01,532 --> 00:05:04,935
AFTER ROGER AILES DIED, YOU SAY

128
00:05:04,935 --> 00:05:07,237
FOX GAVE YOU ALL THIS MAKEUP AND

129
00:05:07,237 --> 00:05:11,942
THIS WAS PART OF ROGER AILES

130
00:05:11,942 --> 00:05:16,180
PLAN FOR SEXTING UP FEMALES.

131
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,349
ANY REGRETS ABOUT THE CHEAP

132
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:18,649
SHOT?

133
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:22,486
>> I LOVE THE FOX NEWS MAKEUP

134
00:05:22,486 --> 00:05:23,087
ARTISTS.

135
00:05:23,087 --> 00:05:25,089
I'M GETTING VERY LITTLE SLEEP

136
00:05:25,089 --> 00:05:27,992
WITH A NEWBORN AND THEY TURNED

137
00:05:27,992 --> 00:05:32,830
ME INTO BEING ALMOST TV READY.

138
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,499
THAT WAS NOT A SHOT AT THE

139
00:05:35,499 --> 00:05:35,933
MAKEUP TEAM.

140
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:37,901
THEY ARE GOOD AT THEIR JOBS.

141
00:05:37,901 --> 00:00:00,000
HOWIE: BUT I WILL SAY YOU ARE
