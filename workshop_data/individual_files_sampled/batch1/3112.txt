said something else about investing that I think it's very profound and simple I think a lot of people don't understand which is to be successful as an investor you have to bet against the consensus and be right first of all why why can't we just buy stocks we think well the code the consensus is built into the price so because the consensus is built to the price in assets priced themselves in a way that they're all they're all compete and they're all of equal value in certain sense there's there's a risk premium of equities over cash and bonds we'll have that over whatever but it's basically they're all priced that way it's like think of it as going to betting on a sports team or in other words you or a horse-racing okay so there's handicapping that's going on so in order to be successful you're betting against the consensus and you have to be right that's that's the game and you described your first trade when you're a teenager bought a stock it tripled you thought hey this is easy but you convey very effectively that in fact it is extremely difficult even though it seems so simple ah being successful in the markets is more difficult than being successful in competing in the Olympics your odds are higher to be successful competing in the Olympics because you have more people trying to do it you have more resources we put hundreds of millions of dollars we have at Bridgewater 15-under people we are now competing against other teams and that's the kind of resources that are going into playing that particular game so think about that in terms of handicapping it it's not an easy thing to do what you can do is achieve balance you can you can to know how to hold a balanced portfolio and to receive something that is a return that's much better than cash achieving balance is something that you can do and and I think that that but it figured if you're going to enter the game since value added is a zero-sum game you have to ask who are you playing against what is you going to the poker game with and you know do you want to do that and as you talk to people in the real world is your sense that people understand what they're up against when they might buy a stock or try to time on institutional investors who are smart by and large understand that the average man tends to be much more reactive if you look at the purchases and sales that they make when something goes up they're more likely to buy it they think ah that's a good investment they don't know how to measure that in terms of oh is that a much more expensive investment that's more likely to go down so that's why you know you put ads in newspapers and they say ah that's what had that return that's what they're attracted to so they tend to buy high and sell low and so they're not the average man should not be playing this game in that way they should be playing the game and humility if you if you think that you're good at playing the game just make sure that it's like going to the poker table or going to the racetrack do it with a little bit of money and watch it and get the best advice that you can to know that you're going to be able to take money out of the system rather than put it in
