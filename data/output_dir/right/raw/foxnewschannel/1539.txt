1
00:00:03,182 --> 00:00:03,615
GOOD EVENING.

2
00:00:03,615 --> 00:00:04,350
WELCOME TO THE SHOW.

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,751
YOU JUST HEARD FROM THE

4
00:00:05,751 --> 00:00:06,118
PRESIDENT.

5
00:00:06,118 --> 00:00:07,086
RIGHT NOW, THOUGH, WE HAVE A

6
00:00:07,086 --> 00:00:08,587
RARE FIRSTHAND ACCOUNT FROM THE

7
00:00:08,587 --> 00:00:11,190
CENTER OF MAYBE THE GREATEST

8
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,225
SCANDAL IN MODERN POLITICAL

9
00:00:13,225 --> 00:00:14,593
HISTORY, THE FBI SPYING ON THE

10
00:00:14,593 --> 00:00:15,928
2016 TRUMP CAMPAIGN FOR NEARLY

11
00:00:15,928 --> 00:00:16,729
TWO YEARS.

12
00:00:16,729 --> 00:00:17,730
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS

13
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,264
AND THEIR DO YOU TELLIFUL

14
00:00:19,264 --> 00:00:22,368
LACKEYS IN THE PRESS DENIED THAT

15
00:00:22,368 --> 00:00:23,168
HAPPENED.

16
00:00:23,168 --> 00:00:25,371
NOW WE DO KNOW THAT IT HAPPENED.

17
00:00:25,371 --> 00:00:27,506
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION USED

18
00:00:27,506 --> 00:00:28,474
GOVERNMENT AGENCY TO SURVEY A

19
00:00:28,474 --> 00:00:29,241
RIVAL CAMPAIGN.

20
00:00:29,241 --> 00:00:30,943
THERE'S NO DENYING THAT.

21
00:00:30,943 --> 00:00:32,811
SO INSTEAD THE USUAL APOLOGISTS

22
00:00:32,811 --> 00:00:33,912
ARE CLAIMING IT WAS A GOOD

23
00:00:33,912 --> 00:00:35,047
THING, IN FACT, SPYING ON TRUMP

24
00:00:35,047 --> 00:00:35,614
TO PROTECT HIM.

25
00:00:35,614 --> 00:00:37,483
BY THE WAY, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO

26
00:00:37,483 --> 00:00:38,751
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

27
00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:40,986
EVEN ASKING QUESTIONS, A SIGN OF

28
00:00:40,986 --> 00:00:42,755
DISLOYALTY, SHUT UP AND OBEY.

29
00:00:42,755 --> 00:00:43,255
NO THANKS.

30
00:00:43,255 --> 00:00:44,323
TONIGHT WE HAVE A DIRECT ACCOUNT

31
00:00:44,323 --> 00:00:45,691
OF WHAT HAPPENED, THE FIRST FULL

32
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:47,526
INTERVIEW WITH A TRUMP CAMPAIGN

33
00:00:47,526 --> 00:00:48,594
OFFICIAL APPARENTLY TARGETED BY

34
00:00:48,594 --> 00:00:50,596
AN FBI SPY.

35
00:00:50,596 --> 00:00:54,366
TIM CLOVIS WAS A FORMER NATIONAL

36
00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:55,534
CO-CHAIRMAN OF THE TRUMP

37
00:00:55,534 --> 00:00:56,035
CAMPAIGN.

38
00:00:56,035 --> 00:00:57,369
IN 2016, HE HAD A FACE-TO-FACE

39
00:00:57,369 --> 00:00:59,805
MEETING WITH A MAN BELIEVED TO

40
00:00:59,805 --> 00:01:02,307
BE WITH ONE OF THE FBI SPIES ON

41
00:01:02,307 --> 00:01:03,809
THAT CAMPAIGN.

42
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,978
SAM CLOVIS JOINS US.

43
00:01:05,978 --> 00:01:07,613
THANKS FOR COMING ON.

44
00:01:07,613 --> 00:01:09,515
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON.

45
00:01:09,515 --> 00:01:16,121
>> YOU BELIEVE YOU HAD A

46
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:16,722
FACE-TO-FACE ENCOUNTER.

47
00:01:16,722 --> 00:01:17,356
DESCRIBE THAT MEETING.

48
00:01:17,356 --> 00:01:20,426
>> SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE THE

49
00:01:20,426 --> 00:01:24,430
SEPTEMBER 1st MEETING I HAD AN

50
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,798
OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE EMAILS

51
00:01:25,798 --> 00:01:31,070
FROM STEVEN HALPER, SAYING HE

52
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,471
KNEW CARTER PAGE, AND ASKED FOR

53
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:33,772
A SIT-DOWN WITH ME.

54
00:01:33,772 --> 00:01:36,942
HE WANTED TO COME IN AND DISCUSS

55
00:01:36,942 --> 00:01:38,844
FOREIGN POLICY AND TO PROVIDE

56
00:01:38,844 --> 00:01:40,712
SOME -- WHAT HE THOUGHT MIGHT BE

57
00:01:40,712 --> 00:01:42,848
HIS -- SOME OF HIS WRITINGS THAT

58
00:01:42,848 --> 00:01:43,949
WOULD BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE,

59
00:01:43,949 --> 00:01:46,285
HELP US, IN THE CAMPAIGN.

60
00:01:46,285 --> 00:01:48,487
I ARRANGED THAT MEETING.

61
00:01:48,487 --> 00:01:50,556
WE HAD THAT MEETING IN

62
00:01:50,556 --> 00:01:52,925
WASHINGTON, D.C. ON THE 1st OF

63
00:01:52,925 --> 00:01:53,292
SEPTEMBER.

64
00:01:53,292 --> 00:01:54,359
IT LASTED ABOUT AN HOUR.

65
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:57,162
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS

66
00:01:57,162 --> 00:02:01,366
OVER COFFEE WITH HIM HIS

67
00:02:01,366 --> 00:02:02,367
RESEARCH, AND IT WAS MOSTLY

68
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:03,335
FOCUSED ON CHINA.

69
00:02:03,335 --> 00:02:05,070
THEN I THINK AFTER THAT MEETING,

70
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,305
AND THEN ON THE 27th OF

71
00:02:06,305 --> 00:02:07,706
SEPTEMBER I RECEIVED AN EMAIL

72
00:02:07,706 --> 00:02:09,741
FROM HIM WITH SEVERAL

73
00:02:09,741 --> 00:02:10,142
ATTACHMENTS.

74
00:02:10,142 --> 00:02:12,377
I CAN BE HONEST WITH YOU,

75
00:02:12,377 --> 00:02:13,579
TUCKER, I HAVEN'T EVEN OPENED

76
00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:15,481
THOSE ATTACHMENTS TO THIS DAY.

77
00:02:15,481 --> 00:02:19,384
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WAS IN THEM,

78
00:02:19,384 --> 00:02:20,519
BUT MOSTLY PAPERS TITLED THAT

79
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:21,220
DEALT WITH CHINA.

80
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,456
I THINK HE USED MY MEETING AS

81
00:02:24,456 --> 00:02:27,759
A -- USING MY MEETING AS A BONA

82
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,760
FIDE WITH GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS,

83
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,162
TO HAVE A MEETING WITH HIM, THAT

84
00:02:30,162 --> 00:02:31,897
I DID NOT KNOW ABOUT, THAT WAS

85
00:02:31,897 --> 00:02:32,731
SUBSEQUENT TO MY MEETING WITH

86
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:35,167
HIM ON THE 1st OF SEPTEMBER.

87
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:39,338
>> SO YOU DIDN'T KNOW HIM

88
00:02:39,338 --> 00:02:39,671
BEFORE?

89
00:02:39,671 --> 00:02:40,939
HE EMAILED YOU COLD?

90
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:46,645
>> NO, I DID NOT.

91
00:02:46,645 --> 00:02:51,517
I JUST GOT THE EMAIL THAT ASKED

92
00:02:51,517 --> 00:02:53,018
FOR THE MEETING, AND HE USED THE

93
00:02:53,018 --> 00:02:54,753
FACT THAT HE KNEW CARTER PAGE.

94
00:02:54,753 --> 00:02:55,721
>> RIGHT.

95
00:02:55,721 --> 00:02:57,022
>> OF COURSE CARTER HAD BEEN

96
00:02:57,022 --> 00:02:58,123
ASSOCIATED WITH OUR CAMPAIGN.

97
00:02:58,123 --> 00:02:59,591
>> AT WHAT POINT DID YOU BEGIN

98
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:00,559
TO SUSPECT HE WAS WORKING FOR

99
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:03,095
THE FBI, SEEKING TO GATHER

100
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:03,996
INFORMATION SURREPTITIOUSLY ON

101
00:03:03,996 --> 00:03:06,298
THE CAMPAIGN?

102
00:03:06,298 --> 00:03:08,934
>> WELL, OUR MEETING WAS LIKE

103
00:03:08,934 --> 00:03:10,536
TWO FACULTY MEMBERS IN THE

104
00:03:10,536 --> 00:03:12,237
FACULTY LOUNGE.

105
00:03:12,237 --> 00:03:13,305
I DIDN'T THINK ANY OF IT UNTIL I

106
00:03:13,305 --> 00:03:16,642
STARTED TO SEE THE REPORTING

107
00:03:16,642 --> 00:03:17,509
THAT CAME OUT RECENTLY.

108
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:19,778
THEN I STARTED TO PUT TWO AND

109
00:03:19,778 --> 00:03:20,479
TWO TOGETHER.

110
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,980
THEN IT MADE SENSE TO ME THAT HE

111
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,116
WAS PROBING TO FIND A WEAK SPOT

112
00:03:24,116 --> 00:03:26,118
IN OUR CAMPAIGN, SOMEONE WHO

113
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:27,619
MIGHT BE VULNERABLE TO

114
00:03:27,619 --> 00:03:30,522
CONNECTING THINGS BACK TO THOSE

115
00:03:30,522 --> 00:03:32,224
ELUSIVE 30,000 EMAILS THAT

116
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,560
SUPPOSEDLY THE RUSSIANS HAD.

117
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,228
I REALLY THINK THAT'S WHAT HIS

118
00:03:36,228 --> 00:03:39,531
TASK WAS, WAS TO CREATE AN AUDIT

119
00:03:39,531 --> 00:03:41,466
TRAIL BACK TO THOSE EMAILS FROM

120
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:43,035
SOMEONE IN THE CAMPAIGN OR

121
00:03:43,035 --> 00:03:44,870
SOMEONE ASSOCIATED WITH THE

122
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,671
CAMPAIGN SO THAT THEY COULD

123
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:48,407
DEVELOP A STRONGER CASE FOR

124
00:03:48,407 --> 00:03:50,876
PROBABLE CAUSE TO CONTINUE TO

125
00:03:50,876 --> 00:03:54,213
ISSUE WARRANTS AND TO FURTHER AN

126
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:54,646
INVESTIGATION.

127
00:03:54,646 --> 00:03:56,114
I REALLY FELT AFTER HEARING ALL

128
00:03:56,114 --> 00:03:58,850
OF THESE OTHER THINGS, LISTENING

129
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,553
TO THE REPORTS THAT I'VE READ,

130
00:04:01,553 --> 00:04:04,189
THAT THIS TRULY WAS AN EFFORT TO

131
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:06,058
BUILD SOMETHING THAT DID NOT

132
00:04:06,058 --> 00:04:06,391
EXIST.

133
00:04:06,391 --> 00:04:08,293
I REALLY THINK THAT WAS WHAT HIS

134
00:04:08,293 --> 00:04:08,860
MISSION WAS.

135
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,562
>> WHY HAVEN'T YOU READ THE

136
00:04:10,562 --> 00:04:13,232
ATTACHMENTS TO HIS EMAILS?

137
00:04:13,232 --> 00:04:16,134
>> WELL, ONE, I WAS BUSY.

138
00:04:16,134 --> 00:04:18,103
I WORKED 16-20 HOURS A DAY.

139
00:04:18,103 --> 00:04:20,772
WE ALREADY HAD A LOT OF HELP ON

140
00:04:20,772 --> 00:04:23,342
FOREIGN POLICY IN AREAS OF

141
00:04:23,342 --> 00:04:23,642
CHINA.

142
00:04:23,642 --> 00:04:24,876
I REALLY DIDN'T THINK THEY WERE

143
00:04:24,876 --> 00:04:27,613
GOING TO CONTRIBUTE TO ANYTHING.

144
00:04:27,613 --> 00:04:28,614
FRANKLY, I'VE GONE BACK AND

145
00:04:28,614 --> 00:04:30,148
REVIEWED ALL MY EMAILS.

146
00:04:30,148 --> 00:04:31,049
I DIDN'T REPORT THAT MEETING TO

147
00:04:31,049 --> 00:04:32,851
ANYONE IN THE CAMPAIGN, SO THE

148
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:35,554
MEETING WAS OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO

149
00:04:35,554 --> 00:04:37,789
ME AS FAR AS ANYTHING YOU COULD

150
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:38,156
REMEMBER.

151
00:04:38,156 --> 00:04:40,626
I'VE LOOKED THROUGH ALL OF MY

152
00:04:40,626 --> 00:04:42,261
PERSONAL EMAILS, EVERYTHING, AND

153
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:43,962
I CAN'T FIND A RECORD OF IT AT

154
00:04:43,962 --> 00:04:44,229
ALL.

155
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:45,764
>> INTERESTING.

156
00:04:45,764 --> 00:04:47,499
THAT MEETING MAY HAVE PLAYED A

157
00:04:47,499 --> 00:04:49,635
KEY ROLE IN A MUCH LARGER STORY.

158
00:04:49,635 --> 00:00:00,000
SAM, THANK YOU FOR THAT ACCOUNT.
