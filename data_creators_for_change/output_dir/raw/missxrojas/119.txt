1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,230
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways to make</font>

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,490
up in the answer but the way we made

3
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,529
them growing up all started with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

4
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:06,330
balloon if you blow the balloon you

5
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,890
tight and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you make some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> phobia</font>

6
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">macho just flour and water you can add</font>

7
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,790
water I generally start with a

8
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">one-to-one ratio and then add more and</font>

9
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,540
more water take strips of newspaper and

10
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">you dip it in the papier-mache and I'm</font>

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,920
like spread it off with your fingers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

12
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,840
then you apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to the balloon surface</font>

13
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,640
you need to do three coats overall

14
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,010
ideally drawing entirely in between this

15
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,660
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be where a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hair dryer comes in</font>

16
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,279
handy here's one I prepared earlier and

17
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,440
this is the first stage where the gleam

18
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,450
has been covered in newspaper with the

19
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,590
first day it doesn't have to be

20
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,420
perfectly perfectly smooth I mean it's

21
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,980
helpful if it is but it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

22
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,540
be so I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get too precise about the</font>

23
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,219
first player cuz that's really your base

24
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,379
you do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go far up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the top</font>

25
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">because when you eventually pop this and</font>

26
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,300
get rid of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> balloon inside you'll</font>

27
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,399
find obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> it loses some resistance</font>

28
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,079
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top so you have to make sure that</font>

29
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,180
you go around kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of as close as you</font>

30
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,010
can to this little not here but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

31
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,780
say the three layers is the true minimum

32
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,699
for this so let's get started with layer

33
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,049
number two so here it's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> piping</font>

34
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:05,760
matter that I also prepared earlier and

35
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,080
kept in the fridge if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're going to</font>

36
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep it from the fridge for a little</font>

37
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,200
longer then you need to put some salt in

38
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,460
it otherwise it's going to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> mouldy</font>

39
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,760
is on beat<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1</font>

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,060
hello it's about one a.m. on saturday

41
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,010
morning very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> early afternoon</font>

42
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,840
morning I should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in bed is way past</font>

43
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,880
my bedtime but I've done two layers and

44
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,300
two layers pretty much dried entirely or

45
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,150
might be another to be future<font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

46
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,710
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see like the places at</font>

47
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,480
which I didn't believe her because

48
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,100
they're like they come<font color="#E5E5E5"> off a little bit</font>

49
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,630
i miss important we do one more layer

50
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,040
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that before you sleep</font>

51
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,960
and this is pretty much dry i also gave

52
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,930
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> some hair dryer action I have had</font>

53
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,550

00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,720
and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very nice but on the downside</font>

60
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,960
I now have about five hours until I have

cool who<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something and hey</font>

like<font color="#CCCCCC"> plasticky joyous shiny read bright</font>

88
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,530

wasting my

90
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,010
expand concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like the fact that</font>

that's inside it i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just gonna feels</font>

123
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,620
dry and then you're going to cut a small

124
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,860
circle in the top so you can see what

125
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm doing I'm just cutting this circle</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I'd listen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of looks like</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">sign in any case there are different</font>

134
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,900
ways to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> i generally like to do</font>

139
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,690
to so you could also do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

140
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,600
stapler and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am actually today just</font>

00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,850
piece of card ok now for me all the time

145
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,770
part<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you could stay plate you</font>

146
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,630
could tape it on the inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well when</font>

147
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,970
you cut also a line through make it like

148
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,950
a really really neat cone you could just

149
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">use clear tape which is what i'm going</font>

150
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,880
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> just fitties and also because of</font>

151
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,390
time but so then I take<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cone on the</font>

152
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:57,470
inside tape it down to secure it have a

153
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,060
good glue then you can glue it down here

154
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,470
if you have a good gun or something and

155
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,010
but I don't all i have<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this massive</font>

156
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">patente</font>

157
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,240
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to embrace so then what</font>

158
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,889
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is on this one that I</font>

159
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,590
made earlier you see how we've got you

160
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,150
want it to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> little feet so that when</font>

161
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,730
you put it on your knee out there you

162
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,830
can tape it down like this so that it

163
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,389
just comes out like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can</font>

164
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:23,070
also tape it on the inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that just</font>

165
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,600
makes everything much more complicated

166
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,950
but if you have a glue gun than that's

167
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,290
much more simple but I've actually quite

168
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,780
like the little<font color="#E5E5E5"> feet so you take a cone</font>

169
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:36,830
do little snips<font color="#CCCCCC"> pull along the bottom</font>

170
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:42,900
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> acceptable intervals but not up too</font>

171
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,370
high i would say maybe a couple

172
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,919
centimeters at most half an inch third

173
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:48,450
