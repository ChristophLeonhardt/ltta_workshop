CALLED THE JAILHOUSE ROCKERS, AS
EVER WITH THIS MAN, YOU CANNOT
MAKE THIS STUFF UP, MARTHA.
>> Martha: THANK YOU VERY MUCH
PRAYED HERE NOW FOR AN EXCLUSIVE
INTERVIEW ON THE STORY, PATRICIA
BLAGOJEVICH, HIS WIFE, GOOD TO
SEE YOU TONIGHT PRAYED I KNOW
YOU SPOKE WITH YOUR HUSBAND
TODAY FROM HIS PRISON, WHAT DID
HE SAY WHEN HE HEARD THIS NEWS?
>> YOU KNOW, HE WAS, AND WE ARE
ALSO GRATEFUL THAT THE PRESIDENT
IS THINKING OF US IN THIS WAY.
BUT IT HAS BEEN SUCH A LONG ROAD
FOR US.
WE HAVE BEEN SO DISAPPOINTED SO
TWICE, AND BY THE PRESIDENT OF
OUR OWN PARTY WE WERE
DISAPPOINTED BY HIM.
SO IT IS HARD TO EVEN HOPE THAT
OUR DEAL MIGHT BE ENDING SOON.
WE KNOW THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
A KIND MAN, HE IS COMPASSIONATE.
HE HAS ALWAYS MEANT FIND KIND TO
MY FAMILY PRAYED HE KNOWS HOW
IMPORTANT IT IS TO GET TO MY
HUSBAND HOME TO BE A FATHER TO
HER DAUGHTER'S PRAYED WE CANNOT
HELP BUT BE HOPEFUL.
>> Martha: YOUR LITTLE GIRLS
WERE YOUNGER AS KIDS ARE, NOW
SEVEN YEARS OLDER.
AND 20 AND 13, RIGHT?
>> MY OLDER DAUGHTER IS GOOD TO
BE GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE THIS
MONTH.
MY OTHER ONE IS 15.
>> Martha: YOU WONDER WHY THE
PRESIDENT HAS BECOME INTERESTED
IN THIS CASE NOW.
YOU THINK ABOUT HIM BEING TAKEN
OUT IN HANDCUFFS, THE
INVOLVEMENT OF COMEY AS WELL, IS
HE SENSITIVE TO THE SITUATION
BECAUSE OF WHAT HE IS GOING
THROUGH.
>> I SEE THAT, I SEE THAT, THE
SAME PEOPLE THAT DID THIS TO MY
FAMILY, THE SAME PEOPLE THAT
SECRETLY TAPED US AND TWISTED
THE FACTS AND PERVERTED THE LAW
THAT ENDED UP MY HUSBAND IN JAIL
THAT ENDED UP MY HUSBAND IN JAI
JAIL.
THE SAME PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DO
THE SAME THING THAT THEY DID TO
MY HUSBAND ON A LARGER SCALE.
THEY WERE EMBOLDENED.
THEY TOOK ON THE GOVERNOR, AND
NOW THEY HAVE IT MUCH HIGHER.
>> Martha: WE HAVE PLAYED A
RECORDING THAT WAS SO FAMOUS,
I'M SURE THAT YOU HAVE HEARD IT
MORE THAN YOU WANT TO.
BUT PEOPLE LISTEN TO THAT AND
THEY SAY, LOOK, HE WAS TRYING TO
SELL THE SENATE SEAT,
PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS ELECTED, HE
HAD A SEAT AS GOVERNOR WHO HE
COULD APPOINT TO WHOEVER HE
WANTED PRAYED I'M NOT GOING TO
GIVE IT AWAY, I WANT SOMETHING
FOR IT.
AND THEY SAY, HIS CRITICS SAY
THAT IS PRETTY CLEAR.
THE JUDGE SEEMED TO AGREE WHEN
HE PASSED UP ON THE OPPORTUNITY
TO LET THEM GO IN 2016.
>> I'M GLAD THAT YOU ASKED ME
ABOUT THAT, BECAUSE YOU KNOW,
THE INTERESTING IS THAT THERE
WERE 70 DIFFERENT AUDIOTAPES
THAT WE WANTED TO PLAY
AT TRIAL BUT WERE SUPPRESSED BY
THE GOVERNMENT.
IF YOU HEARD EXACTLY WHAT HE
WANTED FOR IT, IT WOULD BE A
TOTALLY DIFFERENT STORY.
ALL OF THESE CONVERSATIONS MY
HUSBAND HAD WITH THE STAFF ABOUT
WANTING TO GET A ROSE BILL
PASSED IN ILLINOIS TO PUT MORE
PEOPLE TO WORK OR HEALTH CARE
FOR FAMILIES IN ILLINOIS, ALL OF
THESE THINGS THAT HE HAD LINED
UP THAT HE HAD WANTED FOR THE
SENATE SEAT, NOBODY EVER HEARD.
IT IS FRUSTRATING WHEN PEOPLE
HEAR THAT.
THIS WHOLE SELLING OF THE SENATE
SEAT, THOSE CHARGES WERE THROWN
OUT BY THE COURTS OVER FIVE
YEARS AGO.
THAT CENTERPIECE OF THE CASE WAS
DISMISSED AS POLITICAL BALL
ROLLING.
I WILL MAKE YOU APPOINTMENT IF
YOU APPOINT ME TO THIS, THAT
SEEMED PERFECTLY LEGAL POLITICS.
>> Martha: I LISTEN TO A LOT
OF THE TAPES, THE     THE DASH A
OF THE TAPES, THE     THE DASH L
OF THE TAPES, THE     THE DASH T
OF THE TAPES, THE     THE DASH O
OF THE TAPES, THE     THE DASH F
THE THINGS WERE ABSOLUTELY MENTI
THE THINGS WERE ABSOLUTELY MENTN
THE THINGS WERE ABSOLUTELY MENTD
THE THINGS WERE ABSOLUTELY MENTI
THE THINGS WERE ABSOLUTELY MENTN
THAT TAPE, AS FAR AS A
PUNISHMENT FITTING THE CRIME,
YOUR HUSBAND GOT 14 YEARS FOR
THIS.
WHAT ABOUT FAIR SENTENCING?
IS THAT A CLAIM THAT YOU TRIED
TO MAKE WITH THE JUDGE THE LAST
TIME AROUND IN 2016?
WHY WAS THERE NO OPEN EAR FOR
THAT, DO YOU THINK?
>> I THINK THAT CERTAINLY MY
HUSBAND IS SERVING MORE TIME
THAN ANY OTHER GOVERNOR HAS EVER
SERVED.
BUT ALSO MORE TIME THAN ANY
OTHER POLITICIAN FOR CHARGES
THAT HAVE TO DO WITH SIMPLY
FUND-RAISING.
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THERE
WAS NO KICKBACK TO US, NO FANCY
CARS OR TRIPS.
NO USE AND MISUSING OF THE
CAMPAIGN FUNDS.
AND PERSONAL ENRICHMENT OF ANY
TIME IT WAS FOR THE CAMPAIGN
FUND.
IT IS DARK HOW UNJUST THE
SENTENCE IS.
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT NOTHING
EVER HAPPENED.
THESE WERE ACTUALLY ALL
ATTEMPTS.
NOTHING WAS EVER EVEN CONCLUDED.
THERE WERE NO CONTRIBUTIONS MADE
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
THEY STEPPED IN AND STOPPED MY
HUSBAND BEFORE ANYTHING EVEN
HAPPENED.
>> Martha: THE JUDGE AND THE
JURY, BASICALLY TOLD THE JURY
THAT THEY HAD TO LOOK AT TO THAT
ATTEMPT AS BASICALLY A DONE
DEAL.
AND IT SEEMED LIKE THAT WAS
CONVINCED TO DO IN THE CASE.
I HOPE THAT YOU WILL COME BACK
AND TALK TO US.
WE WILL FOLLOW THIS.
WE WILL SEE WHAT THE PRESIDENT
DECIDES TO DO.
AN OPTIMISTIC DAY FOR YOU AND
