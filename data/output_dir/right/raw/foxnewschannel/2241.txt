WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG TO

36
00:01:01,944 --> 00:01:02,845
PRESENT IT IN MAY?

37
00:01:02,845 --> 00:01:05,414
>> I WON'T SAY HOW WE GOT IT

38
00:01:05,414 --> 00:01:08,117

39
00:01:08,117 --> 00:01:09,118
OBTAINED THIS INFORMATION

00:01:26,435 --> 00:01:27,670
AND TECHNOLOGICAL.

48
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,705
SO IT TOOK US A WHILE TO DO

49
00:01:29,705 --> 00:01:29,972

50
00:01:29,972 --> 00:01:32,641
I MET THE PRESIDENT IN EARLY

SO WE HAVE BEEN EXAMINING IT

59
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,388
SIMULTANEOUSLY.

60
00:01:45,388 --> 00:01:48,991
HERE IN ISRAEL AND HERE IN

61
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:49,425

00:01:49,425 --> 00:01:50,926
AND IT'S TAKEN US A WHILE,

63
00:01:50,926 --> 00:01:52,261
BUT I THINK WE KNOW WHAT WE

64
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:52,561

65
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:53,796

00:01:54,597 --> 00:01:56,732
IT REGIME, THE PREEMINENT

68
00:01:56,732 --> 00:01:58,034
TERRORIST REGIME OF OUR TIME

69
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,469
IN WHICH IT'S GOONS CHANT

70
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:01,303

SECRET NUCLEAR WEAPONS

74
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,208
PROGRAM AND THEY ARE TRYING

75
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,877
UNDER A VERY BAD DEAL TO GET

76
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,044
A NUCLEAR ARSENAL.

77
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:12,415
THEY SHOULDN'T GET IT.

78
00:02:12,415 --> 00:02:13,482
AINSLEY: TELL THE FOLKS AT

DEATH TO ISRAEL.

83
00:02:20,022 --> 00:02:20,990
THEY HAVE KILLED AMERICAN

84
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,425
SOLDIERS IN IRAQ.

85
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:25,161
DESCRIBE A WORLD WHERE THESE

86
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:30,266
RADICAL MULL ALSO

87
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:30,299

RADICAL MULLAHS.O

90
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:31,801
AND HOW SERIOUS THIS WOULD

91
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:33,769
BE FOR ISRAEL AND THE UNITED

92
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:35,438
STATES AND THE REST OF THE

93
00:02:35,438 --> 00:02:35,738
WORLD.

94
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,073
>> WELL, AINSLEY, WHAT YOU

00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,340
JUST DESCRIBED IS WHAT IRAN

96
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,975
IS DOING TODAY WITHOUT

97
00:02:39,975 --> 00:02:40,676
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

98
00:02:40,676 --> 00:02:43,813
I MEAN, IT'S GOBBLE BLING UP

99
00:02:43,813 --> 00:02:45,181
ONE COUNTRY AFTER THE OTHER.

100
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:47,149
IT'S THREATENING TO

101
00:02:47,149 --> 00:02:48,250
ANNIHILATE ISRAEL.

102
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,251
THREATENING TO PUT ITS ARMY

103
00:02:49,251 --> 00:02:51,353
IN SYRIA IN THE SERVICE OF

104
00:02:51,353 --> 00:02:52,822
THE TYRANNICAL REGIME.

105
00:02:52,822 --> 00:02:54,557
IT'S PUTTING PRECISION

106
00:02:54,557 --> 00:02:55,624
GUIDED MOON ADMISSIONS IN

107
00:02:55,624 --> 00:02:55,958
LEBANON.

108
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,626
THAT MEANS THEY CAN FIRE

109
00:02:57,626 --> 00:02:58,661
ROCKETS INTO ISRAEL THAT CAN

110
00:02:58,661 --> 00:02:59,995
HIT THE OFFICE I'M SPEAKING

111
00:02:59,995 --> 00:03:00,863
AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

112
00:03:00,863 --> 00:03:03,132
THEY ARE TRYING TO FOMENT

113
00:03:03,132 --> 00:03:04,533
TERRORISM IN GAZA.

114
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:07,870
THEY ARE FIRING REACTS

115
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,038
NOAHRY ADFROM YEMEN WHICH

116
00:03:09,038 --> 00:03:10,940
THEY ARE ALSO SEEKING TO

117
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,273
CONQUER.

118
00:03:11,273 --> 00:03:12,408
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING

119
00:03:12,408 --> 00:03:13,709
NOW.

120
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:15,277
THEY HATE AMERICA'S GUTS.

121
00:03:15,277 --> 00:03:16,946
IF THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE

122
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,248
DOING WITHOUT NUCLEAR

123
00:03:19,248 --> 00:03:19,582
WEAPONS.

124
00:03:19,582 --> 00:03:20,716
THINK WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF

125
00:03:20,716 --> 00:03:22,551
THEY GET AN ARSENAL OF

126
00:03:22,551 --> 00:03:24,086
NUCLEAR WEAPONS IF THIS DEAL

127
00:03:24,086 --> 00:03:25,654
GOES THROUGH AS IS.

128
00:03:25,654 --> 00:03:26,789
I'M VERY GLAD I HAVE TO TELL

129
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,524
THAT YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS

130
00:03:28,524 --> 00:03:29,992
STOOD SO FIRMLY AND CLEARLY

131
00:03:29,992 --> 00:03:30,759
ON THIS ISSUE.

132
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,328
HE SAID THAT WILL NOT

133
00:03:32,328 --> 00:03:32,661
HAPPEN.

134
00:03:32,661 --> 00:03:33,896
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I

135
00:03:33,896 --> 00:03:35,464
PHILLY BACK AND I THINK IT'S

136
00:03:35,464 --> 00:03:36,832
NOT ONLY IN THE INTEREST OF

137
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,334
ISRAEL AND THE UNITED

138
00:03:38,334 --> 00:03:39,602
STATES, THAT'S OBVIOUS.

139
00:03:39,602 --> 00:03:42,471
IT'S IN THE INTEREST OF THE

140
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:43,172
WORLD.

141
00:03:43,172 --> 00:03:45,307
THIS TYRANNICAL

142
00:03:45,307 --> 00:03:46,642
ANTI-AMERICAN REGIME SHOULD

143
00:03:46,642 --> 00:03:50,079
NOT HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

144
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:50,713
STEVE: THAT'S ONE OF THE

145
00:03:50,713 --> 00:03:54,583
REASONS YOU MADE THAT GREAT

146
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,285
DISPLAY AND PRESENTATION

00:03:56,285 --> 00:03:57,987
YESTERDAY ON TELEVISION,

148
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:58,521
MR. PRIME MINISTER.

149
00:03:58,521 --> 00:04:01,257
YOU WANT THE PRESIDENT OF

150
00:04:01,257 --> 00:04:01,957
THE UNITED STATES TO PULL

153
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,427
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE FACT

154
00:04:05,427 --> 00:04:08,497
THAT MIKE POMPEO AND OUR

155
00:04:08,497 --> 00:04:09,899
INTEL PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT

156
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:11,901
THE COUNTRY OF IRAN IS IN

157
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:12,902
COMPLIANCE RIGHT NOW WITH

158
00:04:12,902 --> 00:04:16,971
THE DEAL?

159
00:04:16,971 --> 00:04:18,173
>> IF YOU HAVE A TERRIBLE

160
00:04:18,173 --> 00:04:20,142
DEAL AND YOU COMPLY WITH A

161
00:04:20,142 --> 00:04:20,676
TERRIBLE DEAL.

162
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:21,944
THAT DOESN'T HELP YOU AT

163
00:04:21,944 --> 00:04:22,211
ALL.

164
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:23,579
THIS DEAL RIGHT NOW.

165
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:24,747
ASSUMING IRAN JUST COMPLIES COML

166
00:04:24,747 --> 00:04:24,780
ASSUMING IRAN JUST COMPLIES COME

167
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,014
ASSUMING IRAN JUST COMPLIES COMS

168
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,081
WITH IT.

169
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:27,883
THEY GOAL THE DISTANCE AND

170
00:04:27,883 --> 00:04:30,152
HAVE WITHIN A FEW YEARS

171
00:04:30,152 --> 00:04:30,853
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID

172
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,521
YESTERDAY, THEY WILL HAVE

173
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:34,790
THE WHEREWITHAL TO PRODUCE A

174
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,192
HUNDRED NUCLEAR BOMBS.

175
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,393
THAT DOESN'T JUSTIFY

176
00:04:37,393 --> 00:04:38,527
CONTINUING WITH THE DEAL AND

177
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,695
I THINK CERTAINLY NOT

178
00:04:39,695 --> 00:04:41,397
CONTINUING WITH IT AS

179
00:04:41,397 --> 00:04:42,031
STRUCTURED.

180
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,265
I THINK, YOU KNOW, I HAVE

181
00:04:43,265 --> 00:04:44,033
SAID.

182
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,268
FULLY FIX OR FULLY KNICKS.

183
00:04:46,268 --> 00:04:48,204
FULLY FIX, YOU NEED A MAJOR

184
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,772
OVERHAUL AND REALLY NEED A

185
00:04:49,772 --> 00:04:50,139
NEW DEAL.

186
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:51,273
THE PERSON WHO IS GOING TO

187
00:04:51,273 --> 00:04:52,775
MAKE THAT DECISION FOR THE

188
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:55,578
UNITED STATES IS ONE PERSON.

189
00:04:55,578 --> 00:04:57,279
THAT'S PRESIDENT TRUMP.

190
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:59,048
AND I TRUST HIS JUDGMENT.

191
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,182
I KNOW THAT HE WILL DO THE

192
00:05:00,182 --> 00:05:01,217
RIGHT THING AND I SAID

193
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,151
YESTERDAY HE WILL DO THE

194
00:05:02,151 --> 00:05:03,185
RIGHT THING FOR AMERICA.

195
00:05:03,185 --> 00:05:04,386
THE RIGHT THING FOR ISRAEL.

00:05:04,386 --> 00:05:06,155
AND THE RIGHT THING FOR THE

197
00:05:06,155 --> 00:05:07,323
SECURITY AND PEACE OF THE

198
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:08,390
ENTIRE WORLD.

199
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,825
BINE BRIAN MR. PRIME

200
00:05:09,825 --> 00:05:11,527
MINISTER, TELL ME IF THIS IS

201
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:11,894
TRUE.

202
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,128
THE PROGRAM SHOWS THAT THEY

203
00:05:13,128 --> 00:05:14,363
WANTED TO BUILD A BOMB

204
00:05:14,363 --> 00:05:15,965
BECAUSE THEN THAT SHOWS

205
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:16,699
VAUGHN LYING.

206
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:17,633
THEY ALWAYS HAVE SAID THEY

207
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:19,034
DIDN'T WANT TO BUILD A BOMB.

208
00:05:19,034 --> 00:05:20,869
IT WAS MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE

209
00:05:20,869 --> 00:05:22,204
THAN ANYONE THOUGHT.

210
00:05:22,204 --> 00:05:23,138
FUNDAMENTALLY WE GO INTO

211
00:05:23,138 --> 00:05:27,876
